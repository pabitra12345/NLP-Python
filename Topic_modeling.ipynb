              "([\"Barclays' defiance of US fines has merit Barclays disgraced itself in many ways during the pre-financial crisis boom years. So it is tempting to think the bank, when asked by US Department of Justice to pay a large bill for polluting the financial system with mortgage junk between 2005 and 2007, should cough up, apologise and learn some humility. That is not the view of the chief executive, Jes Staley. Barclays thinks the DoJâ€™s claims are â€œdisconnected from the factsâ€\\x9d and that it has â€œan obligation to our shareholders, customers, clients and employees to defend ourselves against unreasonable allegations and demands.â€\\x9d The stance is possibly foolhardy, since going into open legal battle with the most powerful US prosecutor is risky, especially if you end up losing. But actually, some grudging respect for Staley and Barclays is in order. The US system for dishing out fines to errant banks for their mortgage sins has come to resemble a casino. The approach prefers settlements behind closed doors and the difference in size of penalties is never explained. Occasional leaks of the negotiating demands make the methodology appear even more arbitrary. Deutsche Bank was initially asked for $14bn (Â£11.5bn), but reached a settlement of $7.2bn on Thursday. Where is the rhyme or reason? There is also a strong suspicion that the roulette wheel is weighted against the Europeans. US banks, in the forms of JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citi, were at the front of the queue for settlement for no obvious reason. If Barclays created and distributed far fewer toxic mortgage securities than its US rivals, which is what the bank argues, why shouldnâ€™t its fine be proportionately smaller? Neither Barclays nor the DoJ is talking hard numbers. But Barclays, it is said, was asked for $4bn, versus its own analysis that a fair sum would be $1bn and $2bn could have been swallowed for the sake of certainty. When the gap is so wide, Barclays is entitled to take its chances in court â€“ and yes, it probably has an obligation to do so. A board canâ€™t let $2bn slip out of the door just for the sake of a quiet life. The case will be messy, inevitably. Barclaysâ€™ practices were â€œplainly irresponsible and dishonest,â€\\x9d according to Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general. There is also a cache of ugly emails and documents. The DoJ lawsuit says Barclays employees called one parcel of securitised loans â€œcraptacularâ€\\x9d. Another was said to â€œlook like shitâ€\\x9d. However, that is almost par for the course in these cases. The central question is the right size of penalty. If Barclays thinks it has been singled out for unduly harsh treatment, the bank should try to prove its case. Staley will look like a fool if he fails, but the willingness to reject the easy option of settling is entirely legitimate.\",\n",
              "  \"How big is Hillary Clinton's lead in the presidential race? It depends on the poll Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton now has an 11-percentage-point lead over her Republican opponent Donald Trump, according to a poll released by PRRI and the Atlantic on Tuesday. If that werenâ€™t already reason enough for Trump supporters to worry, a poll from NBC and the Wall Street Journal released on Monday put Clintonâ€™s lead at 14 percentage points. But why the difference in numbers? If you want to follow polls in the 28 remaining days before the US votes, I strongly recommend you ignore the date that the poll was published â€“ and focus instead on the dates that the poll was conducted. That PRRI/Atlantic poll was based on landline and cellphone interviews that took place on 5-9 October while the data for the NBC/WSJ poll was gathered on 8-9 October. Those dates are potentially significant given that on 8 October, a 2005 recording was released of Trump saying that, thanks to his fame, he was able to grab women â€œby the pussyâ€\\x9d. Itâ€™s highly likely that a larger proportion of respondents were interviewed after the Trump recording was made public in the NBC/WSJ poll compared with the PRRI/Atlantic poll. That could mean a 14-percentage-point lead is a more accurate indication of Clintonâ€™s current position in the race. But the crucial question is whether Clintonâ€™s lead is temporary or permanent. Weâ€™ll need to keep an eye on numbers in the days ahead to understand that. In the meantime, though, itâ€™s worth looking beyond the horserace numbers that appear at the top of the survey and digging a little further. In the PRRI/Atlantic poll, I was curious about a question that provided the statement: â€œThese days society seems to punish men just for acting like menâ€\\x9d â€“ 36% of respondents agreed. Another 41% agreed with the statement: â€œSociety as a whole has become too soft and feminine.â€\\x9d Those attitudes could provide useful information for understanding why voters might support their respective candidates.\",\n",
              "  'Zikaâ€™s greatest ally is human intransigence The revenge of the viruses marches on. After bird flu and Ebola comes Zika, and the possibility of widespread child deformity in mosquito-infested parts of the globe. The impact of the disease is as yet unpredictable, but its spread is so far fierce and unstoppable, and the disease is incurable. While a precise causal link between Zika and small-brain deformity in babies is unproven, the precautionary principle clearly applies. Standing across the path of action are two massive and conservative bureaucracies, the World Health Organisation and the Roman Catholic church. The WHO, caught napping on Ebola, is trying desperately not to repeat the fiasco. But its message is the plodding one, that women should don insect repellent and not get pregnant. With over half of Latin American pregnancies unintended and mosquitoes endemic, it is like holding back a tsunami with a spoon. The Catholic church is equally unhelpful. It discourages birth control, opposes state contraception programmes and bans abortion. In El Salvador an infected woman who seeks an abortion goes to jail. Common humanity demands that this stop. Such is Zikaâ€™s virulence that a sizable proportion of the current generation of Latin American children could yet be born severely disabled. With Ebola the contagion was contained by ruthless isolation and, eventually, drugs. With Zika there is as yet no such remedy. Mass eradication of mosquitoes clearly holds the key, to Zika and many other insect-borne diseases, but that has been the case for decades. The mosquito has long held sway over humankind as the fittest, most adaptable and most vengeful of creatures. So far Zika is confined to Latin America â€“ but what if it reaches Africa? One hope is that introducing new strains of genetically modified male insects holds the key. Early tests in Brazil are promising in reducing mosquito populations, but this has to be a patchy remedy and reports of bureaucratic obstacles suggest the usual delay. Women in these countries need reassurance and emergency help. Since the present danger lies in conception, the relief must lie in access to contraception and ensuring reproductive rights. Insect repellents and lab experiments are no use to an expectant mother, frantic with fear, whose government and church offer nothing but jail or despair.',\n",
              "  \"Fight for the right: Cruz and Rubio spar in Nevada to be Trump's challenger Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio arrived in Nevada late on Sunday with distinctly different pitches for why each should be considered the most viable challenger to the Republican presidential frontrunner, Donald Trump. The two first-term senators effectively tied in South Carolinaâ€™s primary at the weekend and are running short of time to stop Trump, who beat them both by a 10-point margin, from clinching the Republican nomination for the White House. Both senators vowed that they were uniquely positioned to defeat the real estate mogul, but whereas Cruz focused his efforts on firing up Nevadaâ€™s rural, religious right, Rubio underscored the need for a more diverse coalition of conservatives reflective of a new generation. Rubio, who spent part of his childhood in Nevada, a state in which close to half the population are minorities, talked about the support he received from South Carolinaâ€™s governor, Nikki Haley, and Senator Tim Scott. â€œI was on stage receiving the endorsement of an Indian American governor from South Carolina, who was endorsing a Cuban American senator from Florida, and I was standing next to the African American Republican senator from South Carolina.â€\\x9d â€œThis is the face of the new conservative movement,â€\\x9d he told a couple of hundred supporters inside Texas Casino, a resort off the Las Vegas strip. â€œWe are the party of everyone.â€\\x9d Cruz, a senator for Texas, headed straight to hammer-shaped Nye County, which is over 90% white. In Pahrump â€“ with 37,000 or so residents, the regionâ€™s population center â€“ he made a play for the stateâ€™s rural conservatives by promising that if was sworn in as president â€œthe persecution of religious liberty ends todayâ€\\x9d. On a weekend that saw yet another mass shooting, Cruz also pledged to defend the second amendment while boasting of his support from the Gun Owners of America. He further warned, in a state with a sizable Latino population, of the need â€œto finally, finally, finally control the borders and end sanctuary citiesâ€\\x9d. In South Carolina on Saturday, Rubio inched just ahead of Cruz to clinch second place by less than a percentage point. Both candidates nonetheless paled in comparison with Trump, who scored a second consecutive overwhelming victory after the New Hampshire primary on 9 February. Trump holds a similarly commanding lead in Nevada, with the caucuses less than two days away, although surveying in the state is notoriously unreliable. Trumpâ€™s success has left neither Rubio nor Cruz where they had hoped to be at this stage of the race. Rubio, despite bouncing back somewhat from a poor showing in New Hampshire, has yet to win a primary. And Cruz, despite coming out on top of the Iowa caucuses, now faces questions over whether his evangelicals are as loyal to his campaign as had been expected. However, the maverick senator questions the Republican frontrunnerâ€™s support base. â€œDonald Trump has demonstrated that he has a relatively high floor of support,â€\\x9d Cruz said during a brief news conference in the back room of a smoky sports bar on State Route 160. â€œBut heâ€™s also got, I think, a ceiling.â€\\x9d â€œFor folks who are concerned that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go head-to-head with Hillary Clinton, it is becoming clearer and clearer that we are the one campaign that can beat Donald Trump. Indeed, weâ€™re the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump, in Iowa. And we will continue to go forward and beat him.â€\\x9d While he was consistently respectful of his billionaire rival, Cruz dismissed Rubio as an underachiever who had low-balled his prospects throughout the race. Cruz cited in particular an interview of Rubioâ€™s with ABCâ€™s This Week on Sunday, in which host George Stephanopoulos asked the Florida senator which state he thought he could win after losing all three early contests. â€œHe said, â€˜I think we could win Florida, March 15,â€™â€\\x9d Cruz recounted. â€œNow thatâ€™s a fairly amazing admission that they donâ€™t believe theyâ€™re gonna win here in Nevada. Apparently they donâ€™t believe theyâ€™re going to win any states on Super Tuesday.â€\\x9d â€œTheyâ€™re writing off March 5. Theyâ€™re writing off March 8. And theyâ€™re trying to wait, apparently, until March 15 to finally win a state,â€\\x9d Cruz added. â€œAnd I would point out even in Florida, his home state, heâ€™s right now polling in third place, behind both Donald and me.â€\\x9d Rubioâ€™s campaign sought to drive home the opposite message: that it was Cruz who had been left bruised after falling short in a state tailor-made for his evangelical appeal. â€œIf Ted Cruz can do no better than third place in a state like South Carolina where 73% of the electorate described themselves as â€˜born-again or evangelical Christianâ€™, where else can he win?â€\\x9d Rubioâ€™s campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, wrote in a memo on Sunday. Rubio, for his part, charted a path to victory contingent upon winnowing the field and consolidating support behind his candidacy. With former Florida governor Jeb Bush suspending his campaign after South Carolina, Rubio said during an interview with CNN on Sunday, the dynamic was â€œbeginning to shiftâ€\\x9d. â€œThat is what gives us an opportunity to coalesce and bring together Republicans who understand that we have to nominate someone who will unify our party, who will reach out to people that havenâ€™t voted for us and grow our party and ultimately who can win.â€\\x9d The Florida senator struck upon similar themes while rallying with supporters across three states on Sunday â€“ with stops in Nashville, Tennessee, Little Rock, Arkansas, and finally Las Vegas. Framing himself as the most viable general election candidate, Rubio spoke defiantly of his ability to challenge Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. â€œIf you nominate me, we will win this election,â€\\x9d he said. This article was amended on 22 February 2016 to correct a statement that Marco Rubio was born in Nevada. He was born in Florida, but spent some of his childhood in Nevada.\",\n",

Trumpâ€™s legacy: GOP civil war â€œItâ€™s a movement, not a campaign.â€\\x9d Of all the outlandish assertions to emerge from Donald Trumpâ€™s mouth, this one is by far the most credible. Win or lose, Trump has catalyzed a movement that has destroyed the conventional wisdom â€“ and the establishment â€“ that has led the Republican party for a generation, writes Richard Wolffe. Whether he built the movement or simply rode its wave, Trump has profoundly reshaped the politics of the Grand Old Party.

              "  'Twitter U-turns over banning white nationalist Twitter has reinstated the account of Richard B Spencer, a self-styled white nationalist leader who was suspended from the service in the wake of a much publicised crackdown on hateful conduct. Spencerâ€™s account was initially suspended on 15 November, as part of a sweeping move against leaders of the â€œalt-rightâ€\\x9d, a far-right movement which has been resurgent in America since the election of Donald Trump. That same day, Twitter had announced new safety tools on its social network, including the ability to more easily report hateful conduct. It had also announced changes in how it trained its moderators to enforce the policies. The suspension of Spencer, along with the accounts of the white-nationalist National Policy Institute which he heads up and its journal, Radix, was widely seen as a consequence of Twitter putting those new rules in action. Now, however, it appears that Twitter suspended Spencer for other reasons. Twitter sent the a copy of the email the company sent to the white nationalist activist, which suggests that Spencer was banned instead for running multiple accounts with too much overlap. A Twitter spokesperson said: â€œOur rules explicitly prohibit creating multiple accounts with overlapping uses. When we temporarily suspend multiple accounts for this violation, the account owner can designate one account for reinstatement.â€\\x9d The email Twitter sent Spencer reads: As referenced in our November 18, 2016 communication, creating serial and/or multiple accounts with overlapping use is a violation of the Twitter Rules (https://twitter.com/rules). Please select one account for restoration; the others will remain suspended. This account will need to comply fully with the Twitter Rules (https://twitter.com/rules). Please reply to this email with the username of the account you would like reinstated and we will make sure to answer your request in a timely manner. In the weeks following his suspension, Spencer hosted a conference in Washington DC, where audience members gave enthusiastic Nazi salutes (Spencer later said they had been â€œdone in exuberance and funâ€\\x9d). But on 11 December, his Twitter account was reactivated, and its verified status was reinstated. Verification is a special account status the social network gives to notable users to confirm they are who they say they are, but Twitter emphasises that â€œa verified badge does not imply an endorsement by Twitterâ€\\x9d. As one of his first tweets after being reinstated, Spencer said: â€œI worked on getting my personal reinstated first. Next will be Radix, NPI, _AltRight_ and WSP.â€\\x9d But the understands that those accounts, as some of the â€œmultiple, overlapping accountsâ€\\x9d for which Spencer was suspended, are unlikely to be reinstated. When it banned Spencer for the first time, the company declined to comment directly on the suspended accounts, but said â€œthe Twitter Rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies.â€\\x9d What Gamergate should have taught us about the â€˜alt-rightâ€™',\n",

Amid the thousands of DNC emails posted by WikiLeaks on Friday was a 10 September 2015 response to a request from the DNC finance chair, Zachary Allen, to vet the former Nickelodeon star to perform at a gala for the US president. â€œAriana Butera-video caught her licking other peoplesâ€™ donuts while saying she hates America,â€\\x9d the DNCâ€™s deputy compliance director wrote in response, referring to Grandeâ€™s real name. â€œRepublican Congressman used this video and said it was a double standard that liberals were not upset with her like they are with Trump who criticized Mexicans; cursed out a person on Twitter after that person used an offensive word towards her brother.â€\\x9d A few months before the email exchange, on 4 July, Grande was caught on security cameras (obtained by TMZ) licking donuts sitting on the top shelf at a donut shop in southern California. When offered a fresh tray of donuts by an employee of the store, Grande is heard saying: â€œWhat the fuck is that? I hate Americans.

They start to crowd in from around the time I was three or four: Wizzard on Top of the Pops (I was terrified of Roy Wood), Robert Wyatt on Top of the Pops (I was intrigued by his wheelchair), the cartoon polar bear who shilled Cresta pop with the words â€œItâ€™s frothy, manâ€\\x9d, and the song from an advert for Rowntreeâ€™s Tots. I canâ€™t remember the visuals that accompanied it at all, but a snatch of the melody and the lyrics inexplicably clung to me forever afterwards: â€œCandy Tots, something new / Theyâ€™re dolly mixtures and soft to chew.â€\\x9d It would, in the way of ad music, pop into my head unbidden at inexplicable moments, until the day in the mid-noughties when I was sent a compilation of the work of late 60s/early 70s pop journeyman John Carter, variously the lead singer of the New Vaudeville Jazz Band, the brains behind First Classâ€™s fantastic Brian Wilson homage Beach Baby, and the co-author of Summer of Love cash-in Letâ€™s Go to San Francisco by the Flowerpot Men. I was only half-listening to it (as you might expect, given his CV, the musical quality was a bit variable) when the Rowntreeâ€™s Tots advert came bursting from the speakers: it transpired Mr Carter knocked out advertising jingles as well, and Rowntreeâ€™s Tots had been such a success that a spin-off single with altered lyrics was released. A little pathetically, I literally shouted in excitement. It would be nice if I could tell you the song was great, but, alas, 30 years on, it sounded a bit twee and irritating. Moreover, hearing it again didnâ€™t â€“ as I hoped - expunge it from my mind. Itâ€™s still rattling around in there, and I fully expect to be plagued by a jaunty endorsement of the manifold qualities of Candy Tots (long discontinued) on my deathbed. Alexis Petridis Shake nâ€™ Vac Ever since I first heard it as a schoolboy in the early 1980s, the irritatingly catchy Shake nâ€™ Vac ad song has lodged in my poor brain like a virus, and despite not being on TV since 1989, it still pops into my head. A retro, 50s-style rockâ€™nâ€™roll backing accompanies the brutally effective jingle: â€œDo the Shake nâ€™ Vac and put the freshness back / Do the Shake nâ€™ Vac and put the freshness back / When your carpet smells fresh, your room does too â€¦â€\\x9d Argh, no! The advert itself now looks kitsch and dated: Jenny Logan plays a maxi-skirted, high-heeled, bottom-wiggling housewife who sings of the joys of a sinister white powder that resembles anthrax, which is sprinkled over a carpet and vacuumed up again to leave it sparkling clean. Iâ€™ve since resisted the tuneâ€™s demonic calling and marketing witchcraft in the only way I know, by installing laminate flooring. Dave Simpson Carphone Warehouse Poor old Stereo MCâ€™s. Their legacy as British hip-hop pioneers, whose 1990 single Elevate My Mind was the first UK rap entry on the US Billboard 100, will forever be eclipsed by four little words: gonna get myself connected. Yes, the London four-piece were indeed the band who soundtracked those Carphone Warehouse ads with a funk loop nabbed from KC and The Sunshine band affiliate Jimmy â€œBoâ€\\x9d Horne and some sub-Britpop swagger. Like Mansun and soul patches, Connected is a thing of pure Nineties naffness â€“ not quite dance but not quite indie, despite frontman Rob Birch showcasing a meandering, karaoke Tim Burgess vocal style. Although this writer was born two months after its release, its role in the marketing of 10-tonne Motorolas during my formative years means that â€“ pardon the pun â€“ I shall forever feel a connection. Hannah J Davies Milky Way â€œThe red car and the blue car had a race.â€\\x9d Those words alone are enough to set a piece of music racing through the heads of TV viewers of a certain age â€“ the music to the ad known as Red Car Blue Car, made for Milky Way in 1989, a tinny piece of country rockâ€™nâ€™roll written by Mike Connaris, and a song so infernally catchy that when the ad was revived in 2009, there were people who celebrated its return. Even more incredibly, when its lyrics were changed and the song re-recorded as Home for Christmas Day, it reached No 44 in the charts â€“ in December 1991. Yes, even after two years of exposure to the ad, there were people who were not yet sick of it. (These, perhaps, were the same people who decided they needed to buy a copy of Brian Mayâ€™s Ford advert, Driven by You. Or who cheered when John Farnham performed his Gillette razors track The Best in concert.) But Red Car Blue Car did its job. To this day, when I see a red car and blue car next to each other at traffic lights, I wonder if theyâ€™ll race, and if the red car will be able to do anything but stuff its face. Like â€œapples, hazelnuts, bananas, raisins, coconuts, sultanasâ€\\x9d and â€œfeed me! Feed me NOW!â€\\x9d, Red Car Blue Car is now embedded deep within me. It doesnâ€™t make me want to eat Milky Ways, though. Michael Hann MÃ¼ller yogurt Yoghurt advertising is irritating enough as it is: whether itâ€™s Nicole Scherzinger orgasming over a fruit corner or some French children being intolerably wholesome in the vicinity of a Petits Filous, the flogging of the stuff is a small universe of ridiculous commercial fiction. But maybe the industryâ€™s biggest crime was to take the transcendent 1968 Nina Simone song Ainâ€™t Got No, I Got Life, layer some cow sound effects over it, and turn it into a maddening earworm most closely associated with imbecillic milk-based joie de vivre. Another unfortunate side-effect of using it to soundtrack a series of farm vistas is that it makes you realise how much Simoneâ€™s voice resembles a sheepâ€™s. And thus, an icon now exists as little more in my mind than bleating shorthand for a worryingly fanatical devotion to dairy products. Rachel Aroesti Huggies Pull-Ups Morrissey once sang: â€œThe music that they constantly play / It says nothing to me about my life.â€\\x9d That has long been the case for me and the song from the Huggies Pull-Ups advert, which has been constantly playing in my head now for at least two decades despite saying precious little about my life. A quick Google suggests it first seeped into my consciousness when I was barely a teenager. And yet, despite being free of the need to consider elasticated nappy/pant hybrids by, ooh, at least a year or so, the song has remained stitched to my eardrums like some kind of audio Celtic symbol. It is, undoubtedly, one of the most annoying jingles ever recorded. The lyrics are annoying, the tune is moronic and the kidâ€™s voice instilled in me a deep loathing of all human beings under the age of five. And yet Iâ€™ve never felt truly free of its presence. Indeed, if its influence over my daily soundtrack had finally started to wane in recent years, then the arrival of my daughter this summer meant that it has since returned with a vengeance. Of course, now that Iâ€™m in a situation where I might actually need to buy â€œbig kid pantsâ€\\x9d, you could argue that the Huggies advert finally does say something to me about my life. And does that make it any less annoying? No. No it does not. Tim Jonze\",\n",
              "  'Innovations fund aims to save women and newborn babies in Africa Public health experts in east Africa have hailed an initiative that will fund research on the continent in the hope of fostering African innovation. The $7m (Â£5.7m) Grand Challenges Africa innovation seed grants programme â€“ funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and coordinated by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) and the Nepad Agency Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (Aesa) â€“ is calling for ideas from Africa-based innovators working in maternal and newborn child health. In a statement, AAS/Aesa said the five-year programme would provide seed grants worth up to $100,000 each, with successful researchers eligible to apply for further funding of up to $1m to scale up their innovations. â€œSolutions for Africaâ€™s challenges do exist within the continent. As an African grant-making body, we are laser-focused on tapping the best minds on the continent to develop innovative local solutions to our health and development challenges,â€\\x9d said Aesaâ€™s director, Tom Kariuki. That view was echoed by Peter Waiswa, an associate professor at the Makerere University School of Public Health in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. Waiswa, a specialist in maternal and newborn health, said it was good the Grand Challenges scheme now had funds set aside specifically for â€“ and managed in â€“ Africa. Although the grants are small, Waiswa said, they are â€œmost likely going to respond to local needsâ€\\x9d. A key problem for the continentâ€™s scientists is the dearth of Africa-driven research. In Uganda alone, Waiswa said, maternal and newborn mortality and stillbirths add up to about 85,000 deaths a year. â€œThese are double the number of people who die from HIV and Aids in Uganda,â€\\x9d he added, â€œbut all the attention is on HIV. So I think it is good that they are funding into this specific area. But, as I said, they are still small grants and we have to compete for them as a region.â€\\x9d Waiswa said researchers often faced a lack of money for scaling up innovations. This has meant researchers cannot do long-term work. He cited the case of Ugandan scientist Misaki Wayengera, who created a prototype for a quick test for Ebola, but failed to get funding even after writing to the Ugandan president. Only after the latest Ebola outbreak in west Africa that Wayengera received financial support, from Grand Challenges Canada. At Makerere University and Nsambya hospital in Kampala, researchers wanted to solve birth asphyxia (newborn breathing difficulties) by cooling babies to zero, but they lacked funding. â€œThere is a good effort,â€\\x9d said Waiswa, â€œbut government and other partners must come on board to push the science to the rightful conclusion. Even us â€“ we have come up with a couple of innovations but they just die.â€\\x9d Pauline Irungu, the advocacy and policy manager at the health charity Path in Kenya, said maternal and child health in Africa suffered from a lack of investment relative to areas such as HIV and Aids, leading to limited innovation. The Africa-centred grants will challenge African innovators to address other continent-specific health problems, she said. â€œHIV came with a bang. It was killing [so many] people and therefore there was a huge focus on it â€“ there was a lot of investment,â€\\x9d said Irungu, who has worked in public health since 2000. â€œBut I think because maternal and newborn child [mortality] has always been with us. I havenâ€™t seen a similar impetus to put in resources and to push for innovation that can change the trajectory.â€\\x9d Like Waiswa, Irungu hopes the new grants will lead to more Africa-led research. â€œHomegrown solutions combined with world-class innovation is what will solve the problems of Africa,â€\\x9d she said. â€œWe canâ€™t stand back and wait for someone to design something out there and bring it to Africa, and then we adopt it.â€\\x9d Irungu is in no doubt that African scientists can tackle the continentâ€™s problems if given a conducive environment in which to work. â€œWhy are we talking about brain-drain? Africa â€“ we â€“ are exporting brains to the west,â€\\x9d she said, citing the use of antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV infection, for which proof-of-concept was driven by researchers in South Africa. â€œWe donâ€™t only have the brainpower; we also have institutions that are conducting world-class research in Africa. The Kenya Medical Research Institute is currently undertaking a study for a malaria vaccine for children.â€\\x9d Just as enthused about the â€œAfricannessâ€\\x9d of the grants was Betty Walakira, chief executive officer of the Ugandan NGO Health Child. She says that, in poor countries, research funding is not a priority for governments. Yet local researchers continue to show good potential to address such problems as post-partum bleeding. â€œAll this new knowledge is useful in the sense that it can be used in a developing country context,â€\\x9d said Walakira, whose organisation promotes maternal and child health. The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, has been talking up the potential of his countryâ€™s scientists, despite the governmentâ€™s approach apparently being driven more by politics than cohesive policy. At the end of 2015, he was quoted as promising to increase the governmentâ€™s innovation fund from $49m to about $143m. In June, Museveni created a department of science, technology and innovations, and its new minister, Elioda Tumwesigye, has already called for a substantive innovation fund.',\n",
              "  \"Police search Santander's Madrid HQ in money-laundering inquiry Police have searched the headquarters of Santander Bank in Madrid after suspicions were raised that the bank was linked to money laundering and tax evasion on the part of some of its clients. Acting on orders of high court judge JosÃ© de la Mata, agents of the central operative unit of the Guardia Civil began searching the bankâ€™s offices in Boadilla del Monte in central Spain on Friday morning for information about specific accounts. Santander issued a statement saying it had â€œreceived a request for information about the movements of certain accounts between different entitiesâ€\\x9d. It added that it was collaborating with the authorities and â€œsupplying all the available informationâ€\\x9d. The case involves the continuing investigation into the Falciani list of accounts from HSBCâ€™s Swiss private bank in Geneva, leaked by IT worker HervÃ© Falciani in 2008. The list included the names of some 130,000 suspected tax evaders, 659 of whom were Spanish. The Spanish tax office believes that as much as â‚¬6bn was concealed in these 659 accounts. A large number of the 659 people named regularised their affairs with the taxman but several decided to fight in the courts on the grounds that Falciani had obtained the information illegally and it was therefore not admissible as evidence. De la Mata has been investigating whether HSBC helped clients to conceal and launder money from illicit gains. Sources close to the case say that 40 â€œindividuals or family groupsâ€\\x9d are under investigation. All 40 are said to have appeared on Falcianiâ€™s list. A tax inspectorsâ€™ report says that â€œthere are indications that HSBC, either through its offices in Switzerland or its branches in Spain or third countries, offered Spanish residents the possibility of placing substantial sums of money in opaque accountsâ€\\x9d. Emilio BotÃ\\xadn, then chief executive of Santander, was the most prominent Spanish name on Falcianiâ€™s list, along with several members of his family. The BotÃ\\xadn family has run the bank since 1909. BotÃ\\xadn made a â‚¬200m settlement with the Spanish tax agency, which represented 10% of the sum involved, but tax evasion charges were dropped after he made the settlement. His daughter Ana Patricia became CEO when he died in 2014 â€“ she previously ran Santander in the UK.\",\n",
              "  'Gilmore suspends campaign while Trump threatens to sue Cruz â€“ as it happened As a slow mid-primary Friday winds down, letâ€™s recap todayâ€™s biggest stories in #Campaign2016: Jim Gilmore, the Republican presidential candidate whose name you always forgot despite your handy mnemonic (â€œHelp! Rabid Grizzlies! For Peteâ€™s Sake, Call Someone! Please! Call The Police! Just Call!â€\\x9d), officially dropped out of the race for the partyâ€™s nomination. â€œI will continue to express my concerns about the dangers of electing someone who has pledged to continue Obamaâ€™s disastrous policies,â€\\x9d Gilmore pledged, before joining Martin Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s touring rock band of former presidential also-rans. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has apologized for telling a crowd of voters at a rally for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire: â€œThereâ€™s a special place in hell for women who donâ€™t help each other!â€\\x9d in a piece in the New York Times titled â€œMy Undiplomatic Moment.â€\\x9d (From now on, weâ€™re calling every mistake we make â€œMy Undiplomatic Moment.â€\\x9d) Although that may come a little too late for Clinton, whose struggles with female voters were well documented in New Hampshire. Donald Trump threatened to sue fellow Republican presidential candidate and Iowa caucus victor Ted Cruz over the latterâ€™s putatively questionable status as a â€œnatural-born citizen.â€\\x9d Can Trump actually do that? As usual, the answer to that question is secondary to the reaction the position will incite. Recent second-place New Hampshire primary finisher, Ohio governor John Kasich, told an overflow crowd in South Carolina that his presidency would be focused on Theodore Roosevelt-esque reform. â€œIf youâ€™re going to have power, use it to drive creativity, innovation and change,â€\\x9d Kasich said. â€œAnd if you donâ€™t do that, why donâ€™t you get out and go do something else?â€\\x9d Kasich also had a delicious recommendation for fellow presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. â€œI think Bernie ought to be president â€“ of Ben & Jerryâ€™s for a year, because weâ€™d all get free ice cream.â€\\x9d Stay tuned for more dispatches from the 2016 presidential campaign tonight, tomorrow, the next day, and every day until the sweet release of Election Day. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has apologized for telling a crowd of voters at a rally for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire:â€œThereâ€™s a special place in hell for women who donâ€™t help each other!â€\\x9d Albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state, called the episode an â€œundiplomatic moment,â€\\x9d in an op-ed published in the New York Times on Friday. I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line. I did not mean to argue that women should support a particular candidate based solely on gender. But I understand that I came across as condemning those who disagree with my political preferences. If heaven were open only to those who agreed on politics, I imagine it would be largely unoccupied.â€\\x9d Feminist writer Gloria Steinem, who has endorsed Clinton, recently apologized for remarks about young women who support Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, writing in a post that she â€œmisspokeâ€\\x9d and did not mean to imply that young women were not â€œserious about their politicsâ€\\x9d. Taken together, the comments offended female Sanders supporters, and highlighted generational divides in the feminist movement. â€œI am concerned by the tone of the debate about the many problems that specifically affect women,â€\\x9d Albright writes in the op-ed. â€œWe cannot be complacent, and we cannot forget the hard work it took us to get to where we are. I would argue that because of what is at stake, this is exactly the time to have a conversation about how to preserve what women have gained, including the right to make our own choices, and how to move forward together. I would welcome an informed dialogue that crosses generations. We have much to learn from one another.â€\\x9d During Thursdayâ€™s debate, Clinton said theâ€\\x9dspecial place in hellâ€\\x9d remark was nothing new, and Albright has been using it for â€œas long as Iâ€™ve known herâ€\\x9d. But she did distance herself from the implication that women who donâ€™t support her candidacy are somehow wrongheaded. â€œI have spent my entire adult life making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices,â€\\x9d Clinton said, â€œeven if that choice is not to vote for me.â€\\x9d The Washington Examiner is reporting that Jim Gilmore, who served as the governor of Virginia more than 14 years ago, is finally ending his campaign for the Republican nomination. â€œMy campaign was intended to offer the gubernatorial experience, with the track record of a true conservative, experienced in national security, to unite the party,â€\\x9d Gilmore said, according to the Examiner. â€œMy goal was to focus on the importance of this election as a real turning point, and to emphasize the dangers of continuing on a road that will further undermine Americaâ€™s economy and weaken our national security.â€\\x9d â€œNonetheless, I will continue to express my concerns about the dangers of electing someone who has pledged to continue Obamaâ€™s disastrous policies,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAnd, I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that our next President is a free enterprise Republican who will restore our nation to greatness and keep our citizens safe.â€\\x9d Gilmore, who had failed to qualify for all but two of the so-called â€œundercardâ€\\x9d presidential debates, has consistently been at the very bottom of the crowded Republican presidential field, rarely registering with even a single point in national polls. (He never appeared in the Real Clear Politics aggregate poll, making his candidacy functionally invisible.) In the Iowa caucuses, a mere dozen Iowans caucused for Gilmore, who then received 133 votes in the New Hampshire Republican primary. For comparison, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders received 2,095 in the New Hampshire Republican primary, in which he wasnâ€™t even running. 10 reasons why voters are turning to Bernie Sanders When James Walsh asked our readers who they wanted to see as Democratic candidate, we were deluged with responses â€“ most of them in favor of Bernie Sanders: 1) Heâ€™s seen as a challenge to the status quo... What came through loud and clear was the fury at mainstream American politics, echoing the populist support for (the really rather different) Donald Trump on the Republican side. Sanders appeals to those who feel the entire democratic system has broken down. Sanders is representing my interests. For decades American politics have been a sham, elections bought and paid for by special interests and corporations. They have wrecked the environment, caused the biggest financial crisis in history and are using their deep pockets and for profit agendas to marginalize peopleâ€™s needs even further. Shaz Plunkett, Los Angeles CA 2) ... whereas Clinton is viewed as more of the same Clinton paints herself as the pragmatist who gets things done, but after New Hampshire she may need to further emphasise her progressive credentials if sheâ€™s going to win over those turning to Sanders. I have no grudge with Hillary Clinton, but she had her chance eight years ago. She is old news, with plenty of controversy, baggage and history that will bring out Republicans in droves to vote against her. Steve Guion, Fairfax, Virginia 3) Sandersâ€™ consistency is judged a virtue The phrase â€˜flip-floppingâ€™ may bring back memories of John Kerryâ€™s doomed presidential campaign in 2004, but our readers were keen to attach it to Clinton. The consistency of Sandersâ€™ views was seen as a major plus. Iâ€™m tired of the rich getting richer, and having to work harder for less. I saw my parents lose so much of their retirement in the Wall Street crash and no one on Wall Street paid for that. My college education has done me no good but I still have student loans, and none of my kids were able to attend college because of the recession. We deserve change in this country, from someone who has consistently fought that fight. Danielle Banz, Monroe, Washington Marco Rubio walked back his statement in Saturdayâ€™s Republican debate that women should be subject to Selective Service and potentially eligible for the draft, writes the â€™s Ben Jacobs in Greenville, South Carolina: At the South Carolina Faith and Family Forum, the Florida senator said â€œI do not support drafting women and forcing them to be combat soldiers.â€\\x9d This marks a shift from his rather definitive statement on Saturday â€œI do believe that Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women in case a draft is ever instituted.â€\\x9d Instead, Rubio seemed to hedge with the emphasis â€œon forcing them to be combat soldiers. The Florida senator also said â€œI donâ€™t think we need Selective Service,â€\\x9d arguing that a draft would not be necessary in any future war. Rubioâ€™s adjustment on this issue was first elaborated on an issues page on his website which seems to have first appeared on February 9, the day of the New Hampshire primary. The Rubio campaign confirmed that the issues page was not posted until after Saturdayâ€™s debate. However, he had not publicly addressed the topic until now. The statement comes after Ted Cruz has violently denounced the concept, which was also endorsed by Jeb Bush and Chris Christie in Saturdayâ€™s debate. In a campaign rally in New Hampshire, Cruz said â€œthe idea that we would draft our daughters to forcibly bring them into the military and put them in close combat, I think, is wrong. It is immoral.â€\\x9d In the aftermath, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a conservative darling, has announced he will introduce a bill to make women permanently exempt from registering for Selective Service as well. A Rubio spokesman said Thursday that the Florida senator would cosponsor the bill to insure that Congress, not the courts, would make the ultimate decision about women being eligible for the draft. The spokesman insisted to the Daily Caller that his stance did not imply support for Leeâ€™s bill. In December, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced that roles in the U.S. military would be opened to women, without restrictions based on gender. However, women are still exempted from registering for Selective Service, which provides the database used by the government to implement any future draft. In a statement, Alex Burgos, a spokesman for the Rubio campaign insisted â€œthereâ€™s no change here. In the debate, he said Selective Service should be opened to women. And today, he said women shouldnâ€™t be drafted into combat roles. Two separate questions. In sum, Marco does not support drafting women of any age into combat roles - period.â€\\x9d Donald Trump has threatened to sue fellow Republican presidential candidate and Iowa caucus victor Ted Cruz over the latterâ€™s putatively questionable status as a â€œnatural-born citizen.â€\\x9d Itâ€™s the strongest indication yet that Trump aims to continue highlighting the fact that Cruz was born in Canada. The Texan senator was born in Calgary in 1971. Although his father, Rafael, was not an American citizen at the time, his Delaware-born mother, Eleanor, was. Article II of the US constitution requires that â€œno person except a natural born Citizen â€¦ shall be eligible to the Office of President.â€\\x9d However, legal scholars have long interpreted natural born citizen to refer to whether someone acquired their citizenship at birth, not the geographic location where they were born. As a result, Cruz, who was a citizen at birth, is a natural born citizen. The Democratic rivals clashed over race and immigration issues in last nightâ€™s debate in Milwaukee, writes the â€™s Lauren Gambino - with votes Nevada and South Carolina looming: The battle lines have been drawn for the next phase of the head-to-head betweenHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as they target race and immigration issues in an effort to court black and Latino voters in their bid for the Democratic nomination. The 2016 election race moves south and west â€“ to Nevada, South Carolina and then a clutch of southern states as part of the sweep of Super Tuesday contests on 1 March. And as the pair met on a debate stage for the first time since Sanders crushed Clinton in New Hampshire, the focus on inequality in the justice system and on conditions faced by hard-working immigrant families was an unambiguous pitch for votes. John Kasich, fresh from a second place finish in New Hampshire, is widely seen as a flag-bearer of the Republican establishment but today showed his own rebellious streak, reports Washington correspondent David Smith from Columbia, South Carolina: â€œI watched them blow the whole surplus and I ask people, who do you think was in charge of blowing a $5 trillion surplus and they always say itâ€™s the Democrats, and I say unfortunately it was a Republican House, Republican Senate and Republican president blew the whole thing,â€\\x9d he told the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce in Columbia. Reflecting on economic reforms he introduced as governor of Ohio, Kasich added: â€œIf youâ€™re going to have power, use it to drive creativity, innovation and change. And if you donâ€™t do that, why donâ€™t you get out and go do something else? Iâ€™m a big reformer. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not in the establishment lane because I always make them nervous.â€\\x9d Visibly relaxed, a freewheeling Kasich also cracked a few jokes, including at leftwing Democrat Bernie Sandersâ€™ expense. â€œI think Bernie ought to be president â€“ of Ben & Jerryâ€™s for a year, because weâ€™d all get free ice cream.â€\\x9d He also referenced the movie Jaws as he described volunteers flocking to his campaign, saying: â€œWe need a bigger boat.â€\\x9d The governor said blue collar voters were moving his way but added: â€œMy father was a Democrat. If Iâ€™d have said, â€˜Dad, are you a socialist?â€™ heâ€™d have kicked me out of the house.â€\\x9d In another routine, Kasich recalled explaining to his 16-year-old twins what a payphone is and took an iPhone from an audience member to make a point about innovation. Kasich said he was determined to maintain an upbeat message and not be dragged into trading insults with other candidates. â€œI felt coming out of New Hampshire, even though theyâ€™d spent millions against me, and theyâ€™ll do it here as well, the light outshined the darkness of negative campaigning.â€\\x9d But he added: â€œI will not be a pin cushion... Iâ€™m pretty scrappy, you know.â€\\x9d Kasich recalled launching his campaign in July last year and operating in â€œtotal obscurityâ€\\x9d. A friend asked him how it felt to be stuck at 1% for a hundred days. He said he did not read the papers. Around 60 people gathered in the chamberâ€™s boardroom. Adeline Saint-Jour, 32, a physician and undecided Republican voter, who asked a question during the event, said later: â€œI thought he made a very good point about having young people understand their goals early in life. He made a good point about mentoring.â€\\x9d One journalist commented afterwards: â€œKasich is going to be vice-president.â€\\x9d Lots of new ads out there â€“ hereâ€™s one attacking Trump from Right to Rise, the Super Pac supporting Jeb Bush, employing a cool ice statue of Trump... ...and hereâ€™s one attacking Trump from the political action committee attached to the Club for Growth, the anti-tax group that has for years been calling out Trump for not being a true conservative: â€œThereâ€™s nothing conservative about Donald Trump: Trump, naturally, has responded to the attacks on Twitter: Watching the rise of Donald Trump from loudmouthed celebrity to serious US presidential candidate spurred illustrator and filmmaker Guy Larsen to produce a satirical childrenâ€™s book in which Trump is controlled by a malevolent hair piece. Watch Larsen read his book here: N.B.: Trump does not wear a wig; thatâ€™s his â€œrealâ€\\x9d hair. Republican candidates Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, are speaking at a Faith and Family Presidential Forum in Greenville, South Carolina. Carson has just finished explaining how Jesus Christ is his role model: â€œTreat others as you would wish to be treated.â€\\x9d Hereâ€™s a live video stream: The forum is hosted by the Palmetto family alliance and the conservative leadership project on the campus of Bob Jones University. Washington correspondent David Smith is taking in a rally with Ohio governor John Kasich, who finished second in New Hampshire, at the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. The cash-tight Kasich camp got good news Thursday, when it received a sudden pledge of support from Ken Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot. â€œAt South Carolina Chamber of Commerce in Columbia where around 60 people plus media have filled a boardroom to hear candidate John Kasich,â€\\x9d David tweets: Kasich on presidential campaign: â€œI got in in July. I operated in total obscurity.â€\\x9d Polls showed me at 1% but I didnâ€™t read the papers. Kasich: In New Hampshire â€œthe light outshined the darkness of negative campaigningâ€\\x9d. Weâ€™ll have more from David on the event shortly. For its impressive display of strength and creativity here at weekâ€™s end, Ted Cruzâ€™s media shop is not incapable of missteps. For example, an actress in a new campaign spot, â€œConservatives Anonymous,â€\\x9d used to do soft porn, which the Cruz camp was not aware of until the ad was cut and distributed. Then BuzzFeed figured out the porn connection: Amy Lindsay has appeared in films such as Erotic Confessions, Carnal Wishes, Secrets of a Chambermaid, and Insatiable Desires. â€œHad the campaign known of her full filmography, we obviously would not have let her appear in the ad,â€\\x9d a Cruz campaign spokesman told BuzzFeed News. The actress in question is the one who says, â€œMaybe you should vote for more than just a pretty face next time.â€\\x9d The retraction of the group therapy ad comes after a string of ad successes from Cruz, who this week released two video spots attacking Donald Trump and one attacking Hillary Clinton. The ads have been praised for a witty allusion to pop culture, in one case, and a devilishly effective line of attack against Trump for his attempt, once upon a time, to use eminent domain laws to clear a widowâ€™s house for a limousine parking lot in Atlantic City. While the Democrats next caucus in Nevada (on 20 Feb), Republicans next vote in South Carolina (the same day) â€“ and then the parties trade states. So whoâ€™s running first in the South Carolina primary? While not quite the no-poll zone that Nevada is, voter surveys are sparse in the Palmetto State; Real Clear Politicsâ€™ average of three polls over the last two months puts Donald Trump at +17 on the field. A poll from Opinion Savvy for the Augusta Chronicle conducted after the New Hampshire result has Trump up about 17 points on Ted Cruz, 36.3-19.6, with Marco Rubio third at 14.6 points. (The Chronicle poll is baked into the RCP average.) So what? Owing to the confusing rules for allocating delegates to the national convention laid out by the South Carolina Republican party, a win of that margin for Trump, if it is consistent across the stateâ€™s congressional districts, could mean that he gets close to running the table of all 50 of the stateâ€™s delegates. The state awards 29 delegates to the overall winner and then three delegates each to the winner of each of seven congressional districts. See the gory details here. More catchy negative ads from Texas senator Ted Cruz, this one again hitting Donald Trump, with the tagline, â€œWe wouldnâ€™t tolerate these values in our children... why would we want them in a president?â€\\x9d The ad features kids playing with a Donald Trump doll. â€œHe pretends to be a Republican,â€\\x9d one kid says and they all crack up. Then they smash a dollhouse bellowing â€œeminent domain! Eminent domain!â€\\x9d What do you think of these Cruz ads? The two against Trump â€“ â€œpower for personal gainâ€\\x9d and the one above â€“ and the Office Space ad against Clinton? Pretty effective, no? Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders next square off in the Nevada caucuses. Whoâ€™s ahead there? Who knows â€“ thereâ€™s not much polling. The Real Clear Politics average uses two polls in the last four months and shows Clinton up 20. But hold the phone: a new poll by a TargetPoint, a Republican polling firm, conducted for the Washington Free Beacon finds â€“ a tie! at 45-45. Can it be true? What happened to Clintonâ€™s Hispanic firewall in Nevada? To her local organization of DREAMers touting her record on immigration reform? Turn all eyes to Jon Ralston, the dean of Nevada politics journalists, who says the result â€œdoesnâ€™t surprise me.â€\\x9d As for the Team Clinton work to lower expectations that Ralston mentions: in multiple venues yesterday, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and spokesman Brian Fallon sought to erode the notion that the demographics of Nevada, with a significant non-white population, play well for Clinton. â€œThereâ€™s an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucus in Nevada,â€\\x9d said Fallon. â€œBut itâ€™s still a state that is 80 percent white.â€\\x9d [Nevada: itâ€™s basically Iowa, with more feather headdresses.] Which prompted Ralston to forcefully call bushwa: 80 percent white? What? [...] I understand the desire of Team Clinton to lower expectations in Nevada after being crushed by Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. But both Mook and Fallon know that 80 percent figure is ludicrous, and the attempt to make Nevada seem like Iowa and New Hampshire is a spin too far. The facts: Nevadaâ€™s Hispanic population is about 27 percent. African-Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders make up almost 10 percent each. That is, nearly half of the stateâ€™s population is made up of minorities. The Democratic caucus population was 35 percent minority in 2008, according to exit polls, and is expected to be as high as 40 percent in 2016, according to local Democratic sources. This is nothing like the 90 percent white caucus participation in Iowa, for instance. Read more Ralston here. The Cruz campaign is putting out so many catchy ads we can hardly keep up. Hereâ€™s a gem: an attack on Clinton over her use of a private email server, based on a scene from Office Space, the 1999 ballad of disaffected cubicle life: Hereâ€™s the scene from the movie (warning: some harsh language in there, if youâ€™re offended by that kind of thing): Is there any aspect of politicking Trump canâ€™t shake up? Signing a baby! Whatâ€™s he going to come up with next? Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House, which is a peculiar kind of race, in that the point is not to get there first, the course is scattered, and instead of Gatorade the runners ingest lots of pizza. Did you watch the Democratic debate on PBS last night? Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders tangled over immigration reform, being friends with Henry Kissinger and whoâ€™d done more to support President Obama. â€œOne of us ran against Barack Obama,â€\\x9d said Sanders. â€œI was not that candidate.â€\\x9d Watch these video highlights: And read Lauren Gambinoâ€™s (@lgamgam) report last night from the scene in Milwaukee: â€œIn what was easily her strongest debate performance in recent memory â€“ and arguably her strongest since the campaign began â€“ Hillary Clinton was calm, cool and collected at Thursday nightâ€™s debate,â€\\x9d writes columnist Lucia Graves: Clinton couldâ€™ve been understandably on edge, as she was fresh off a resounding loss in New Hampshire on Tuesday and an effective tie in Iowa the week before. But it was Sanders who was oddly on the defensive despite what has been momentum in his favor, starting out the night more combative than Clinton and wasting his time on petty one-liners. (When Clinton talked about building political capital when sheâ€™s in the White House, for instance, Sanders began a rebuttal with â€œSecretary Clinton, youâ€™re not in the White House yet.â€\\x9d) Read the full piece here: Thereâ€™s a lot going on today out on the trail, meanwhile, including the development of what looks to be a magnificently nasty battle between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump to win South Carolina. Cruz has dropped what is being hailed as the first effective anti-Trump ad of the campaign cycle so far, called Parking Lot and telling the story of Trumpâ€™s attempt to take a widowâ€™s home using eminent domain, literally to build a limousine parking lot: Trumpâ€™s firing back on Twitter, calling Cruz a â€œliar, crazy or very dishonestâ€\\x9d: We have a lot more ground to cover today.

              "  'Manchester City pin hopes on key trio after West Ham expose flaws While JosÃ© Mourinho picked the wrong moment to talk about fake results when Manchester City thumped Chelsea 3-0 in August, the recently unemployed one certainly made a valid point about how the final score can unfairly alter the narrative. Mourinhoâ€™s line came to mind after more ruthless finishing from Sergio AgÃ¼ero rescued a barely deserved point for Manuel Pellegriniâ€™s stuttering title challengers at Upton Park, leaving West Ham United with the rare sensation of feeling disappointed after failing to secure their first league double over City in 53 years. West Ham led twice, only for AgÃ¼ero to cancel out Enner Valenciaâ€™s snappy double with two goals of his own, and there is a temptation to praise City for mounting spirited fightbacks from a goal down in both halves. Scoring an 81st minute equaliser at the home of a team who relish bloodying the noses of opponents with superior resources is usually interpreted as a sign of belief, resolve and togetherness. Scratch the surface, however, and Cityâ€™s wide range of flaws soon begin to emerge. They were evident as early as the first minute, when Cheikhou KouyatÃ© tore past a half-hearted challenge from Yaya TourÃ© in the build-up to West Hamâ€™s opener, and they materialised again in the 56th minute, amateurish defending allowing Valencia to score his second after the striker muscled on to a huge throw from Michail Antonio. The beaten Joe Hart made no attempt to hide his displeasure with his defence. City badly miss the assurance of their captain, Vincent Kompany, and Pellegrini was unable to say when the Belgian centre-back will return from his latest calf injury. Nicolas Otamendi was embarrassed by Valencia for the second goal and MartÃ\\xadn Demichelis was fortunate not to be sent off for a cynical challenge on Antonio in the first half. Playing alongside Fabian Delph, TourÃ©â€™s failings were exposed by West Ham, who are sixth after a run of one defeat in 10 matches. Alex Song was dominant in midfield and Dimitri Payetâ€™s skill took the breath away. Pellegriniâ€™s defence of TourÃ© was as convincing as Otamendiâ€™s attempt to stop Valencia. â€œHe played today as a defensive midfielder,â€\\x9d Pellegrini said. â€œI think that Yaya played in that position without any problem.â€\\x9d That was a generous assessment. Yet the defensive deficiencies do not tell the full story. In the league, City have not had consecutive victories since October and have won one of their past eight away games. For all AgÃ¼eroâ€™s opportunism, they drifted after going 2-1 down. David Silva faded after a promising start, Kevin de Bruyne could not shake off Sam Byram and JesÃºs Navas was shackled by Aaron Cresswell. Raheem Sterlingâ€™s impact as a substitute was minimal. At least Kelechi Iheanacho was bright after replacing Delph, his driving run leading to AgÃ¼ero nonchalantly making it 2-2. â€œThey put us under pressure,â€\\x9d Slaven Bilic said. â€œWe were under pressure but the good point is, letâ€™s say second half, when we beat them at the Etihad 2-1, second half, it was the Alamo, it was like them, them, them. We were kicking the ball out. This was like, with our quality, we were also keeping the ball, we were stretching them.â€\\x9d Yet, although City lacked hunger and purpose, they remain three points off the top. They are playing within themselves and they may only require a slight improvement to win the league, especially if AgÃ¼ero stays fit. The best striker in England has started 2016 with six goals in six matches. â€œThe last problem was when he was with his national squadâ€\\x9d Pellegrini said. â€œHe scored four times against Newcastle and I changed him as he was feeling some problems. Unfortunately he played for his national squad three or four days after and he had a muscle injury. So I hope now that he is 100% fit and he does not have any problem and it is very important that the team plays with him in every game. â€œIn the first 23 games, in the 11 players who played the most minutes, we donâ€™t have AgÃ¼ero, Silva, Kompany. I hope that in the second part of the season they will be involved in all the games because they are very important.â€\\x9d Man of the match Alex Song (West Ham United)',\n",
              "  'Fans dismay as Premier League snubs cap on away ticket prices The Football Supportersâ€™ Federation has expressed bitter disappointment that Premier League clubs failed to back a measure to cap away ticket prices at their most recent meeting, while Liverpool have expressed dismay at the news that some of their supporters are to stage a walkout from Saturdayâ€™s game against Sunderland in protest at the new Anfield pricing structure. It is understood that while no vote was taken on away tickets at Thursdayâ€™s meeting of all the Premier League clubs, informal soundings were taken that made it clear the proposal would not received the two-thirds majority required. Discussions are continuing about whether clubs, promised an Â£8.3bn bounty from broadcasting rights, will agree to an across-the-board cap on away prices or seek instead to boost the existing away fans ticket fund. The FSF chief executive, Kevin Miles, who has been leading its Twentyâ€™s Plenty campaign for a Â£20 cap, said: â€œWe are incredibly disappointed to learn that a proposed cap on away ticket prices was voted down by the Premier League clubs yesterday in a secret ballot. Supporters will not let them off the hook. â€œFootball supporters are right to be angry about the Premier League clubsâ€™ apparent reluctance to tackle the problem of ticket prices. Top-flight clubs have known since last year that they will be receiving a huge increase in their TV revenues. In the light of that windfall, Premier League clubs cannot justify maintaining high ticket prices, particularly for away fans.â€\\x9d He added: â€œDespite clubs failing to agree a way forward yesterday, this issue will not go away and fans will continue to fight for fair ticket prices. We understand that the Premier League will be working with clubs over the coming weeks to find a way forward. That must result in meaningful action on away prices at the next shareholdersâ€™ meeting at the end of March. If clubs have the will to do this there must be a way.â€\\x9d Arsenal fans this week complained that the club was asking season ticket holders for a surcharge of up to Â£30 for their home Champions League tie against Barcelona, although the club released a statement on Friday night which said they would cancel the charge given the outcry. It is understood that most clubs largely agree on the need for action on away ticket prices, having accepted that they are crucial to providing the atmosphere that helps maintain the Premier Leagueâ€™s broadcasting income. But some clubs are believed to be reluctant to agree a universal cap for fear that it will erode their ability to set their own prices or could lead to complaints from home fans who sit in equivalent seats but pay more. Instead, they favour an increase to the away fans fund, which currently stands at Â£200,000 per club per season and can be spent however each individual club sees fit. The FSF would like to see both a cap and an increase to the fund, as well as a commitment to continue to engage on wider ticket pricing issues. The matter will now be discussed again at the next meeting of Premier League clubs in late March, which will be their last before next seasonâ€™s prices are set. Arsenal denied that they were among the clubs against movement on ticket prices, but are understood to favour an increase in the fund rather than a price cap. â€œWe argued for the most extensive package of support for travelling fans and we are sure there will be a good solution,â€\\x9d said a spokesman.',\n",
              "  \"Merkel can't afford Deutsche Bank crisis to get out of hand Tidjane Thiam, the former Prudential chief now running Credit Suisse, wonâ€™t be thanked by his counterparts at Deutsche Bank for saying so at this moment, but he is correct: big European banks are â€œnot really investableâ€\\x9d and the industry is in a â€œvery fragile situationâ€\\x9d. Look at the share prices to see that investors agree. In the old pre-crisis days, banks traded at a premium to their book value on the reasonable assumption that the business of lending would tend to increase profits over time. These days discounts to book value are the norm for big banks. Low interest rates, accompanied by piles of government debt trading at negative yields, has made lending fundamentally less profitable. Banks can shed staff and overheads, but that is not a cost-free process. Meanwhile, mergers â€“ essentially grander cost-cutting exercises â€“ are more or less forbidden because the world canâ€™t stand more institutions that are too big too fail. The position is a mess. Put another way, big banks used to run on obscene levels of leverage and havenâ€™t found a new model to allow them to plod through the era of near-zero interest rates. That is why it is wrong to regard the crisis at Deutsche as merely a standoff with the US Department of Justice over the size of the penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in 2005-07. Yes, a demand for $14bn (Â£10.8bn) â€“ or possibly even half that sum â€“ would probably trigger a need for more capital, as analysts say. But investors can also see that Deutsche is years behind even its peers in adapting to the new world. UBS rallied around its asset management division; Barclays sold its asset manager, shed many of its continental European business and is getting out of Africa. Deutsche, by contrast, has tried cutting costs but has not radically changed shape. Even now, the co-chief executive, John Cryan, talks about a restructuring that will take five years, a timescale that looks far too relaxed if he finds himself pleading with his shareholders to give him more capital at short notice. It is still quite possible that the DoJâ€™s demand could fall from $14bn to $4bn, which would allow everybody to breathe more easily. But, given whatâ€™s at stake, it would be amazing if German chancellor Angela Merkel and her officials are not working on contingency plans for Deutsche. She has to deny all such suggestions, of course, because there is no point fuelling the sense of crisis. But this crisis in confidence in European banks, with Deutsche at the centre, has been brewing for at least 12 months. If the German government and Frankfurt regulators werenâ€™t paying attention, they werenâ€™t doing their job. Germans wonâ€™t sit around in game of pass the parcel German companies still do the simpler business of delivering parcels well, which is why Royal Mailâ€™s share price fell 3% on news that Deutsche Post, owner of DHL, is buying UK Mail for Â£243m. Deutsche Post is a â‚¬33bn (Â£28.6bn) titan and wonâ€™t be returning to the UK parcels industry simply to sit on UK Mailâ€™s 4% share of the market. It will want to grow. The timing is cute from Deutsche Postâ€™s point of view. It has waited for UK Mail to overcome teething problems at its new automated sorting centre. It is paying 43% more than UK Mailâ€™s share price on Tuesday but well below the all-time high. From UK Mailâ€™s point of view, you can understand why chairman Peter Kane, who started the business in 1971 as a taxi firm in Harrow, has decided to sell. Amazon, which is building an in-house delivery operation, is gradually become a competitor rather than a customer for the industry. For Royal Mail, the game wonâ€™t change overnight. It is still the dominant player and internet shopping in the UK is still booming. But 3% off its share price looks about right: Deutsche Post has very deep pockets. When any excuse for a thumbs-down will do Get ready for the European lobbying event of the year. The proposed Â£24bn merger between the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche BÃ¶rse has been sent to Brussels for a full competition inquiry. Almost every EU finance ministry will have an opinion. Letâ€™s hope somebody throws a large spanner in the works. This deal looks highly dangerous for the City of London if it encourages financial business to flow out of the UK, a risk that can only be assessed properly once the terms of Brexit are settled. The commission is worried about pan-European competition, not the UKâ€™s national interest, but any grounds for a thumbs-down will do.\",\n",
              "  'How did email grow from messages between academics to a global epidemic? Ray Tomlinson, the man who literally put the â€œ@â€\\x9d in email, died on Saturday, but his invention, which allowed electronic messages to spread across the internet and fill our lives and our inboxes on a daily basis, will live on. Here is a brief look at what Tomlinson started and the evolution of email through the last half-century. The first electronic message - 1965 The very first version of what would become known as email was invented in 1965 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as part of the universityâ€™s Compatible Time-Sharing System, which allowed users to share files and messages on a central disk, logging in from remote terminals. Tomlinson and the @ - 1971 American computer programmer Tomlinson arguably conceived the method of sending email between different computers across the forerunner to the internet, Arpanet, at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), introducing the â€œ@â€\\x9d sign to allow messages to be targeted at certain users on certain machines. Emails become a standard - 1973 The first email standard was proposed in 1973 at Darpa and finalised within Arpanet in 1977, including common things such as the to and from fields, and the ability to forward emails to others who were not initially a recipient. The Queen sends her first email - 1976 Queen Elizabeth II sends an email on Arpanet, becoming the first head of state to do so. Eric Schmidt designs BerkNet - 1978 Eric Schmidt, who would later lead Google and oversee the introduction of Gmail, wrote Berkley Network as part of his masterâ€™s thesis in 1978, which was an early intranet service offering messaging over serial connections. EMAIL program developed - 1979 At the age of 14, Shiva Ayyadurai writes a program called EMAIL for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, which sent electronic messages within the university, later copyrighting the term in 1982. Whether or not this is the first use of the word email is up for debate. Microsoft Mail arrives - 1988 The first version of Microsoft Mail was released in 1988 for Mac OS, allowing users of Appleâ€™s AppleTalk Networks to send messages to each other. In 1991, a second version was released for other platforms including DOS and Windows, which laid the groundwork for Microsoftâ€™s later Outlook and Exchange email systems. CompuServe starts internet-based email service - 1989 CompuServe became the first online service to offer internet connectivity via dial-up phone connections, and its proprietary email service allowed other internet users to send emails to each other. Lotus Notes launched - 1989 The first version Lotus Notes was released in 1989 by Lotus Development Corporation, which was bought by IBM in 1995. The start of spam - 1990 The rise of spam can be charted back to the very early days of Arpanet, but it wasnâ€™t until the early 1990s that it hit users across the internet, when it was aimed at message boards and later email addresses. April 1994 is the first recorded business practice of spam from two lawyers from Phoenix, Laurence Carter and Martha Siegel, who ended up writing a book on it. The attachment - 1992 The attachment was born when the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (Mime) protocol was released, which includes the ability to attach things that are not just text to emails. And so begins the painful exercise of trying to delete emails to make space after someone sends you a massive attachment in the days of limited inbox space. Outlook and Aol - 1993 The first version of Microsoftâ€™s Outlook was released in 1993 as part of Exchange Server 5.5, while at the same time US internet service providers AOL and Delphi connected their email systems, paving the way for modern, overloaded email systems we struggle with today. Hotmail launches - 1996 Before Microsoft bought it for $400m, 1996 saw the launch of one of the first popular webmail email services called HoTMaiL developed by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith. It was one of the first email services not tied to a particular ISP and adopted new HTML-based email formatting â€“ hence the stylising of the brand name. It was bought by Microsoft in 1997, rebranded MSN Hotmail, then Windows Live Hotmail and replaced by Outlook.com in 2013. Yahoo Mail follows - 1997 Yahoo Mail was launched the year after Hotmail, which was gaining users by the thousands, and was based on internet company Four11â€™s Rocketmail, which was bought as part of Yahooâ€™s acquisition of the company. Youâ€™ve Got Mail, and so has everyone else - 1998 Email was cemented in the public consciousness with the notorious â€œyouâ€™ve got mailâ€\\x9d sound of email arriving for AOL users, which formed the cornerstone of the 1998 Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan romantic comedy, Youâ€™ve Got Mail. By the late 1990s spam was becoming a real problem â€“ inducted to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1998 â€“ as more and more marketers jumped on the practically zero-cost outreach proposition and inundated our inboxes. In 2002, the European Union released its Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, which included a section on spam that made it illegal to send unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes without prior consent of the recipient. The US passed similar laws in 2004, although neither have been particularly effective at reducing the load. Gmail launches - 2004 Googleâ€™s popular email service, Gmail, started life as an internal mail system for Google employees, developed by Paul Buchheit in 2001. It wasnâ€™t unveiled to the public until a limited, invite-only beta release in 2004. It was made publicly available in 2007 and dropped its â€œbetaâ€\\x9d status in 2009. Fighting back against spam - 2005 The first email standard to attempt to fight the deluge of spam by verifying senders was published after a five-year development. Sender Policy Framework was then implemented by a variety of anti-spam programs. A standard of authentication to attempt to prevent email spoofing and phishing was also released called DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). Email goes mobile for casual users - 2007 Appleâ€™s first iPhone was released in 2007, which began to introduce mobile email to the consumer masses. Until that point pre-capacitive consumer smartphones typically had limited email support, while RIMâ€™s BlackBerry had brought the burden of work email to employee palms starting in 2003. Buried in email - 2015 From humble internal communications beginnings, email now dominates a vast proportion of everyday life. An estimated 4.4bn email addresses are in use worldwide with 205bn emails sent per day in 2015, according to data from market research firm Radicati Group. That number is set to increase to over 246bn emails a day by the end of 2019. What was the best (and worst) email you ever received? 12 things todayâ€™s gamers donâ€™t remember about old games',\n",
              "  \"Markets relaxed as state aid looms for Italy's Monte dei Paschi â€“ as it happened A surge in the banking sector has helped lift European markets, as investors once again shrugged off the Italian referendum result and the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. Hopes that the countryâ€™s parliament might pass a budget on Wednesday provided some support, as did the continuing optimism that investors might rescue struggling Monte dei Paschi. If that does not happen, there was growing talk that a state bailout could take place this weekend. The idea that the bank would be recapitalised one way or another pushed the Italian banking index 9% higher, its best one day performance since 8 July. Monte dei Paschi itself added 1%, while Unicredit climbed 13%. Elsewhere Deutsche Bank jumped 8% while in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland rose nearly 6% and Barclays 4.5%. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 33.01 points or 0.49% at 6779.84 Germanyâ€™s Dax rose 0.85% to 10,775.32 Franceâ€™s Cac climbed 1.26% to 4631.94 Italyâ€™s FTSE MIB jumped 4.15% to 17,757.80 Spainâ€™s Ibex ended 2.64% higher at 8893.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 622.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points or 0.1%. On that note, itâ€™s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and weâ€™ll be back tomorrow. Back with Boeing, and Donald Trumpâ€™s tweet saying the company was charging too much to build the new Air Force One - $4bn - and should lose the contract. Boeing has now responded with a statement, saying: We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer. Ratings agency Fitch has moved its outlook on Italian banks from stable to negative for 2017, in the wake of the referendum vote and worries about their ability to recapitalise. Fitch said: The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased urgency and risks for Italian banks. Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures The â€œNoâ€\\x9d vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed to our revision of the Outlook on Italyâ€™s â€˜BBB+â€™ sovereign rating to Negative in October. The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sectorâ€™s ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further... Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using internal rating models. Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook limiting banksâ€™ ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks focus on cost-cutting. We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in additional capital requirements at some banks. The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing programme this week. So says David Rees of Capital Economics. But he adds: Nonetheless, the political situation in Italy, and indeed the rise of populism in Europe more generally, is something to keep an eye on in the months ahead. Italyâ€™s economy and banking sector are weak, and if the Five Star Movementâ€™s momentum continues to build, it may not be long before an exit from the euro becomes a more realistic concern for investors....Similar fears have rocked emerging market equities in the past, when the Greek debt crisis first came to the fore and Spanish and Italian bonds came under fire in 2012. Italyâ€™s banking sector continues to recover, helped by talk that the countryâ€™s parliament might approve its budget on Wednesday, and there could be a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi this weekend. The countryâ€™s banking index is currently up more than 7%, its best daily performance since the middle of July. The overall European banking index is up 3%, hitting its highest level since the middle of January. More fallout from Donald Trumpâ€™s election - this time affecting UK mortgage rates. Rupert Jones reports: The first evidence has emerged that the era of record-low fixed-rate mortgages may be coming to an end after HSBC withdrew its â€œcheapest-everâ€\\x9d deal and increased rates on other products. HSBC had been offering a mortgage that allowed customers to lock in for two years at a rate of 0.99%, but this deal has been pulled with immediate effect. The bankâ€™s new mortgage offers are coming in at up to 0.5% higher. The move follows warnings from mortgage brokers that a number of factors, including Donald Trumpâ€™s US election win, were set to push up the cost of new fixed-rate home loans. David Hollingworth at broker London & Country Mortgages said: â€œThe bottom of the market may have been hit. This [announcement] and the broader changes from HSBC, which has been very aggressively priced in the fixed-rate market, could spell the end of the sub-1% fixed rate, but also signals a potential turning point for fixed mortgage rates.â€\\x9d The full story is here: Donald Trump may be casting doubt on Boeingâ€™s Air Force One order, but elsewhere US manufacturers are doing well. New orders for US factory goods rose 2.7% in October, the biggest increase for nearly a year and a half and just above expectations of a 2.6% improvement. The September figure was revised upwards from a gain of 0.3% to 0.6%. The latest figures mark the fourth straight month of increases. But there could be clouds ahead, given the strength of the dollar following Trumpâ€™s election victory. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: US factory orders surged... in October, providing manufacturers with plenty of optimism in what has been a turbulent year. Uncertainty surrounds the sector, though, amid renewed strength of the dollar and the incoming presidentâ€™s trade policy, particularly his approach to China. Donald Trumpâ€™s promised fiscal stimulus and the increasing likelihood of raising interest rates has fuelled a greenback rally, and that could starve off exports and hit US factories hard in the new year. And hereâ€™s a video clip of Donald Trump outlining his unhappiness with Boeing. Along with the Oval Office, the nuclear codes and the attention of the whole world, winning a US presidential election gives you the power to move the markets. And airline maker Boeing just saw that for itself. Shares in Boeing fell by 1% at the start of trading in New York, after Donald Trump declared on Twitter (where else?) that the firm was charging too much to build the new Air Force One, and should lose the contract. The suggestion that the next US president might take a tough line has worried investors in Boeing (after all, he does have his own Trump Force One). Over in Greece this morning there has been much merriment over the euro groupâ€™s decision last night to define the contours of a debt relief agreement for the country long at the centre of Europeâ€™s financial crisis. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens For the first time since economic crisis engulfed Greece just over seven years ago, a sitting government in Athens has felt fit to describe a decision taken in Brussels as a â€œnational success.â€\\x9d The positive spin and brave faces that have greeted the three bailouts rolled out for Greece, so far, have today been superseded by a genuine sense of relief at the announcement of short-term measures to lighten the countryâ€™s mountainous debt load. Many in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, said the move by euro zone partners to shave â‚¬45bn euros off the pile â€“ the equivalent of 22 percent of GDP â€“ by extending the repayment period and adjusting interest rates - exceeded â€œevery expectation.â€\\x9d Addressing reporters today the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos described the decision both as a â€œsignificant achievementâ€\\x9d and â€œdecisive step for the stabilisation of the Greek economy and complete restoration of confidence.â€\\x9d But as Greeceâ€™s political opposition was quick to point out the victory was bittersweet. This might be the first time that the nationâ€™s unmanageable debt burden has been addressed head-on â€“ and as such can only be seen as rich reward for prime minister Alexis Tsipras - but it comes against a backdrop of calls for Athens to adopt yet more austerity once its current bailout programme expires in mid-2018. Amid signs of a looming showdown with the International Monetary Fund, which says further belt-tightening is the only way to plug the looming fiscal gap and thus ensure its own participation in Greeceâ€™s third bailout to date, the spokesman called the demands â€œirrational.â€\\x9d Athens, he insisted, would neither accept the German proposal for Greece to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % through 2028 nor the IMFâ€™s demands for extra measures in 2019 and 2020. Both are expected to dominate talks when auditors representing creditor institutions return to continue negotiating a second review of policy measures set as the price of bailout funds. â€œGreek society cannot endure more measures,â€\\x9d said Interior minister Panos Skourletis hinting at the battle that is brewing. â€œThe Greek economy canâ€™t endure them either.â€\\x9d Angelino Alfanoâ€™s prediction that Italy could hold a general election in February 2017 didnâ€™t impress the markets, sending shares and bonds down from their earlier highs: But shares are now pushing higher again, following a report that the parliament might approve the 2017 budget on Wednesday, in a confidence vote. Thatâ€™s sent the FTSE MIB index back up to its earlier highs, gaining 1.7% today. Over in Italy, a political leader has suggested that fresh general elections could be held next February. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, whose centre-right party is part of Matteo Renziâ€™s coalition, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that: â€œI forecast there will be the will to go to elections in February.â€\\x9d Significantly, Alfano was speaking after having met with Renzi (whose resignation was put on hold by the countryâ€™s president last night). Hereâ€™s Reutersâ€™ take: Alfano rose to prominence as a key ally of Silvio Berlusconi, before dramatically splitting from the former PM in 2013 to form a new party. Italian bonds are still looking stable as traders head for lunch: One fundamental problem with Italian banks is that there are too many of them, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She argues that closing some branches would help make the sector competitive, and free up capital for other uses: Italy has more bank branches than pizzerias, in the future it desperately needs more pizza and less banks! She also explains why Monte dei Paschiâ€™s future matters, especially if its cash call fail this week. Itâ€™s certainly not as systemically important as other banks, for example Italyâ€™s Unicredit, but Monte dei Paschiâ€™s main problem is that it has become symbolic of Italyâ€™s rotten banking sector that now relies on foreign capital for life support. If the Qatariâ€™s decide against investing in it then it gives a terrible signal to the world about the â€˜investabilityâ€™ of Europeâ€™s banks. Interestingly, in Europe it is not the systemically important banks that are the biggest risk to the financial sector, but the glut of mid-size banks that hold billions in bad debts that could endanger the health of the bigger banks in Europe, if contagion is to spread. Business confidence in Italy is likely to be hurt by the political uncertainty created by Sundayâ€™s referendum result, and the struggles in the banking sector. Ana Boata, economist at trade insurance firm Euler Hermes, believes 0.3 percentage points could be knocked off growth next year, taking the annual rate down from 0.9% to 0.6%. She predicts that foreign investment will be hit, and Italian firms could suffer high financing costs if their banks remain weak: While there is no need to panic, the resounding â€˜Noâ€™ result and political turmoil that has followed could cause a mild confidence crisis in 2017. Even without any spill over to banks or the bond market, we expect -0.3pp of Italian GDP could be shaven off, leaving the economy with the prospect of a mere 0.6% growth next year. â€œIt will be Italian companies that bear the brunt of a confidence shock, albeit a mild one, which are already contending with some of the worst cash flow conditions in the world â€“ businesses are waiting on average for 88 days for payment for goods and services. We are likely to see divestment from abroad and tougher financing conditions mean that inward investment levels will stay flat, compared to 2% growth we previously predicted for 2017, and hamper the economyâ€™s chances of recovery.â€\\x9d European banking shares are rallying this morning, as traders look for silver linings in the Italian political upheaval. Almost every bank in the index of major European banks, the Stoxx 600, has gained ground. The prospect of Monte dei Paschi (-2.6%) receiving a dose of state aid this weekend is calming the markets, as this would remove the risk that it might simply collapse. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, has taken his eye of his companyâ€™s plunging share price to explain all: One of the biggest worries surrounding the referendum was the impact it could have upon the nationâ€™s banking system, with the likes of Unicredit and Monte dei Paschi in the midst of a recapitalisation and bank rescue plan. Plans to raise substantial funds at Monte dei Paschi have hit the buffers after the â€˜Noâ€™ vote and while a likely government bailout may not be the ideal otucome for the bank, it will mitigate the risk of a collapse and contagion in the region, hence the widespread gains across the financial sector today. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has weighed in on Brexit this morning, warning that the UKâ€™s demands are not compatible with a smooth exit from the EU. Our politics liveblog has all the details: Britainâ€™s financial spread-betting firms love to talk about the possibilities created by stock market volatility. But theyâ€™ve had a nasty taste of it themselves this morning, after the City regulators announced a crackdown on â€˜contract for differenceâ€™ products. CFDâ€™s allow a customer to make big profits if they correctly predict a market move -- or see their nest egg crushed by the stampeding herd if they get it wrong. So today, the FCA announced new rules to prevent â€œinexperiencedâ€\\x9d clients from getting burned. It wants to restrict how much leverage a retail customer can take on (to restrict them from taking big positions on a small deposit), and better risk warnings. And no wonder - given that 82% of clients manage to lose money on CFD! All sensible-sounding stuff. But shares in IG and CMC Markets, two of the biggest players, have both plunged by 30% this morning -- showing how profitable these retail investors have been. More here: The pound has hit a two-month high this morning, after chancellor Philip Hammond meets with fellow finance ministers in Brussels. Arriving at the meeting, Hammond told reporters that the UK government hasnâ€™t ruled out paying into the EU budget in return for access to its markets. He said: â€œWe want to keep all options open.... That is something we would have to look at, looking at the costs and the benefits based on what is in the best interests of the British taxpayer.â€\\x9d The possibility of a so-called Soft Brexit has nudged sterling up to $1.277 this morning, its highest level since early October. European stock markets are remarkably calm this morning. Most stock indices are up in early trading, led by Italy, where the banking index has rallied by almost 2%. Shares in Monti dei Paschi, though, have fallen by 3% in volatile trading, as investors wonder whether its rescue plan can be salvaged by the weekend. Britainâ€™s FTSE 100 is becalmed, down a few points. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE is lacking any macro-momentum bar the continued, and exhausting, Brexit-brouhaha that have been a constant presence since June, meaning it is struggling to significantly break through the levels it has been stuck around for the last few months. Newsflash from Italy: The Rome government will be desperate avoid inflicting bail-in losses on small bondholders, says the Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s Robin Bew: That could mean breaking EU rules on bank rescues, unless Italy can â€˜bendâ€™ them by finding a way to compensate those small savers. Hereâ€™s a handy reminder of how badly Italian banks have fared this year, and how badly Italy has performed this millennium, from the Wall Street Journal. Italian government debt is strengthened in value this morning, showing that the markets remain relaxed about the situation. The rally has pulled down the yield on Italyâ€™s 10-year bonds to 1.95%, down from 1.9% last night, and actually lower than before Sundayâ€™s referendum. The gap between Italian and German debt remains steady too - another sign of market calm. The Financial Times reckons that Monte dei Paschi may have to be bailed out this weekend. It all depends whether Qatar can be persuaded to still back its â‚¬5bn cashcall, even though Italy has been plunged into political limbo. Hereâ€™s the key points. Bankers are running out of private-sector solutions for Monte dei Paschi di Siena and have told the Italian lender to prepare for a state bailout this weekend after prime minister Matteo Renzi was felled by a referendum defeat. While financial markets responded relatively calmly to the referendum result, people briefed on the situation said the political upheaval made it â€œmore difficultâ€\\x9d to secure a â‚¬1bn investment from Qatar on which Monte dei Paschiâ€™s â‚¬5bn capital-raising plan hinges. Senior bankers fear that a failure to shore up the bank, which was the worst loser of this summerâ€™s European bank healthcheck, could damage already jittery investor confidence about Italyâ€™s overall banking sector, which is hobbled by â‚¬360bn of bad loans and weak profitability. JPMorgan Chase and Mediobanca, advisers to Monte dei Paschi, have been working with Pier Carlo Padoan, Italyâ€™s finance minister, to persuade the Qatar Investment Authority to pump money into Italyâ€™s third-largest lender. But hope is fading that they can secure a deal by this weekâ€™s deadline. Without the cornerstone investment from Qatar, the other parts of the complex plan to fill the bankâ€™s â‚¬5bn capital shortfall are likely to collapse. Reuters is reporting that Italian authorities are standing by to provide â€˜precautionaryâ€™ state aid to their oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi, if its rescue plan fails. Intriguingly, this measure could (apparently) allow Rome to get much-needed capital into MPS without triggering European rules forcing some bondholders to take a hit. That would protect those families and pensioners who hold bank bonds. Hereâ€™s the story: Measures to allow state aid for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena are ready but will depend on political developments in coming days, sources familiar with the matter said. The Tuscan lender is looking at the idea of a precautionary recapitalisation which would avoid the triggering of European bail-in rules, one source said. Monte dei Paschi needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.38 billion) by the end of December to avoid being wound down, but investors are reluctant to back the cash call after Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lost a referendum on Sunday and pledged to resign. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Matteo Renziâ€™s defeat in Sundayâ€™s Italian referendum continues to reverberate around Europe, even though the outgoing PM has agreed to stay on a little longer to get the countryâ€™s 2017 budget passed. The big worry, of course, is Italyâ€™s banks - with their â‚¬350bn of non-performing loans and uncomfortably thin capital reserves. The City is watching to see if Renziâ€™s defeat has scuppered the plans to recapitalise these institutions using private money; potential investors could well have been scared away by the crisis in Rome. If these efforts fail, then Italyâ€™s government may have to activate bail-in procedures, which would inflict losses on private bondholders. And in Italy, that includes many members of the public. As CMCâ€™s Michael Hewson explains, the Italian banking sector is a serious worry: Any new government technocratic or otherwise is still faced with the unenviable task of either bailing in the Italian banking sector and wiping out a wave of Italian pensioners and savers, or defying Brussels and trying to bail the banks out with taxpayerâ€™s money in contravention of new rules to protect taxpayers. As it is the recapitalisation plan for Monte dei Paschi di Siena is much more problematic now that Renzi has gone given the uncertainty that is likely to come next as we await the shape of any new administration. No one in their right mind is likely to invest in a bank that has already been bailed out three times in the last few years against such an uncertain political backdrop. One thing is certain the events of the last few days make it likely that we will see the ECB extend its asset purchase scheme by at least another six months, beyond March 2017 when they meet later this week. The wider stock markets, though, continue to be quite relaxed about the political situation in Italy. Most European indices rose yesterday, and traders are expecting a quiet morning today. Weâ€™ll also be watching Greece, which was last night granted some short-term debt relief by its European creditors. But more seriously, the eurogroup and the IMF are still split over Greeceâ€™s fiscal targets, meaning the Fund still hasnâ€™t officially joined the â‚¬86bn bailout programme. Euro zone grants Greece short-term debt relief; no deal with IMF\",\n",
              "  'Watchdog demands banking overhaul to save customers money A package of measures intended to help customers save Â£92 a year by switching their bank accounts has faced criticism for failing to do enough to encourage competition among the high street banks. After two-year investigation into the sector, the competition watchdog said technological advances that helped the development of Uber and Google Maps would make it easier for customers to compare bank accounts and should encourage customers to shop around. The Â£5m investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority â€“ first announced in July 2014 when former Labour leader Ed Miliband was vowing to create new banks â€“ is intended to kickstart competition in a sector where only 3% of personal and 4% of business customers switch to a different bank in any year. It also tried to tackle the Â£1.2bn a year the banks make from unarranged overdraft charges, as customers with overdrafts find it more difficult to change accounts. Banks will be required to send alerts to customers going into the red and set a monthly cap on such charges, which some campaigners argue are higher than those levied by payday lenders such as Wonga. But Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns at consumer watchdog Which?, said: â€œIt is disappointing that the monthly charge cap is not actually a cap and banks will be allowed to continue to charge exorbitant fees for so-called unauthorised overdrafts, rather than protect those customers that have been identified as among the most vulnerable.â€\\x9d The CMA stepped back from breaking up the big four â€“ Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays â€“ which control 77% of the current account market and more than 80% of small business accounts. The key plank of the proposals is the adoption of new technology in 2018 that will enable customers to see hidden charges applied to their accounts, allowing them to shop around for the best deal. This might eventually happen through the creation of a â€œdigital appâ€\\x9d or a sophisticated price comparison website â€“ but this â€œopen bankingâ€\\x9d technology will need to be developed. Alasdair Smith, who chaired the investigation and has faced criticism in the past for holding back from tough reforms, said: â€œWe are breaking down the barriers which have made it too easy for established banks to hold on to their customers. Our reforms will increase innovation and competition in a sector whose performance is crucial for the UK economy.â€\\x9d The CMA said that personal customers could save Â£92 on average a year by switching provider, with savings of around Â£80 a year on average available for small businesses. â€œLarger savings are available for overdraft users â€“ for example, personal customers who are overdrawn for one or two weeks every month could save Â£180 per year on average,â€\\x9d the CMA said. The use of free-if-in-credit banking â€“ in which customers do not pay a fee for services if they do not go overdrawn, but do not receive interest on their balances â€“ by the big four is often criticised as impeding competition. This is because it can make it difficult for customers to see how much they are paying for their banking services in hidden charges. Spanish-owned TSB â€“ once part of Lloyds â€“ wanted customers to be sent monthly bills to tackle this. Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, said: â€œThe CMA has played right into the hands of the big banks and missed a golden opportunity to enable people across the UK to get a better deal from their banks.â€\\x9d MPs were also unimpressed. The Treasury select committee will call the CMA to give evidence in the autumn and Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the MPs would not give up on trying to find ways to give customers more choice. â€œUntil people are able to find out how much their bank charges them for their current account, millions of customers will be denied genuine choice in retail banking. Thereâ€™s a lot to digest but, based on what Iâ€™ve seen so far, Iâ€™m not optimistic that the CMAâ€™s remedies will get to the heart of the problem,â€\\x9d said Tyrie. Rachel Reeves, a Labour MP who sits on the committee, will ask the Financial Conduct Authority to consider measures similar to those imposed on payday lenders to cap charges on overdrafts. The measures that were rejected Breaking up banks The CMA concluded there was insufficient evidence that the current structure of the industry was hurting competition. The separation of TBS from Lloyds Banking Group and the troublesome split of 300 Williams & Glyn branches out of Royal Bank of Scotland were â€œexpensiveâ€\\x9d and â€œhigh disruptiveâ€\\x9d for customers. Both those divestments were demanded by the EU as a result of the taxpayer bailouts. Ending free-if-in-credit banking The CMA concludes this works well for many customers. The real problem is whether customers can work out if they are getting the best deal. Easing capital requirements for mortgages New banks need to hold more capital for lending than established players. Two members of the inquiry group thought this could be a barrier to entry but it was rejected on the grounds that it was not appropriate to create â€œregulatory uncertaintyâ€\\x9d given work already being undertaken by the Bank of England.',\n",

              "  'European Union referendum polling day â€“ as it happened The polls are closing now following a campaign which many believe was the most divisive in British politics. On election nights, itâ€™s usually at this time that broadcasters put out their exit polls and make their projection for the night ahead. There is no such exit poll this time however, although some financial institutions are said to have commissioned private exit polls which they are likely to keep to themselves. Hereâ€™s your guide on how the night is expected to play out. Now, turn over to Andrew Sparrowâ€™s referendum night blog, which has just launched. Weâ€™re getting some reports around the country of people who say that they have been turned away from election booths. They include people who turned up, polling card in hand, only to be told that their name was not on a list. Itâ€™s hard to gauge at this stage how extensive those problems might have been but Iâ€™ll try to look into a few of those later. Has Boris Johnson conceded defeat even before the polling stations close or is this a little bit of mischief? Lewis Iwu, a Londoner, says that he bumped into the MP on the underground a little earlier and was asked if he voted leave. Iwu said no and suggested that Johnson had also conceded defeat. Ever the attention grabber, live pictures are also now coming in of Johnson leaving his vote until almost the last minute. Weâ€™re into the last half an hour of voting.

Bit worried about Robert Pestonâ€™s paltry stock at ITV at this stage ... Global stock markets have been climbing sharply today as investors took the view that the UK was increasingly unlikely to vote to leave the European Union, reports the â€™s Nick Fletcher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just closed 1.29% higher, with banking shares among the main gainers. Earlier in London the FTSE 100 finished 1.23% higher, while the pound is currently up 1% at $1.4875. But the recent rally could be dramatically reversed if the leave campaign does end up winning the day. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at City firm CMC Markets, said: â€œThe FTSE 100 has gained nearly 7% in the last seven days while the pound has rebounded from lows of 1.4010 to peak earlier today at 1.4950 and post its highest levels this year, as the polls continue to improve in favour of remain. â€œThis suggests that a good part of this remain bounce could well be largely priced in already and if we get some early results in the early hours of the morning pointing to a move back to the leave camp then sterling could drop back sharply, potentially dragging stock markets down too.â€\\x9d Away from the torrential rain in some parts of Britain, the possibility of Brexit has been very much on the minds of Britons in sunny southern Spain.

The â€™s Sam Jones has been canvassing opinion in Orihuela Costa, the largest British enclave in Spain: Early evening found Colin Lindgren nursing an al fresco pint at the Emerald Isle club and reflecting on his paradoxical feelings about Brexit.

If heâ€™d got round to getting his postal vote in on time, he would have opted to remain. Yet if he were still in England, he would have voted to leave the EU. â€œI donâ€™t like the way we were conned into it as the man on the street,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWhen we first went into it, it was a trading deal. Itâ€™s just escalated and the whole thing has got totally out of hand.â€\\x9d There is however, little to tempt him back to the UK â€“ and itâ€™s not just the excellent Spanish healthcare, the bowls and the sense of community in Alicante province. â€œWe couldnâ€™t afford to go back now,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIf we had to, it would be very expensive. The cost of living here is lower and itâ€™s a very sensible life.â€\\x9d Academic researchers have concluded that 61.6% of young voters intended to vote to remain in the EU. Thatâ€™s a survey â€“ the details have just come â€“ by Oxford and University of Manchester researchers who worked with the data firm RIWI to run the survey from the beginning of March up to June. Partial responses came from 7,444 people under the age of 40. A last email push is being made by both sides.

That said: Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis may have had no qualms about loudly declaring their voting intentions in the EU referendum, but the once-in-a-generation poll proved more divisive among the 180,000 festivalgoers who arrived in the last 24 hours. Eavis was not allowed to have a polling station on site but had repeatedly urged people coming on Thursday or before to arrange either a postal or proxy vote â€“ advice it seems many followed. The Fleming family, who had travelled from Chesterfield for their first Glastonbury together, were divided on the issue. Parents Tim and Jane, 51, both favoured Brexit, but their daughter Holly, 20, took the opposite view. â€œIt just isnâ€™t that bad in the EU and weâ€™re going to be the generation where if it goes tits up, weâ€™ll have to sort it out,â€\\x9d she said. Susan Hardisty, 60, who was also at Glastonbury for the first time, said the referendum was â€œone of the most important votes of our generation, more important than the general electionâ€\\x9d. She added: â€œWe have kids in their 20s and I think the world will be a lot easier for them if we are part of the EU. And the thought of retracting into an isolated little Britain just scares the life out of me.â€\\x9d A council in an area where a polling booth was temporarily closed after a man was stabbed nearby has been using Twitter to let voters know that itâ€™s open again. A 19-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident in Huddersfield, which West Yorkshire police said was not linked to the EU referendum. The man was found collapsed with a stab wound in the Waverley Road area of the town at 5.15pm. Frances Perraudin had some more details earlier. Remain campaigners in Islington, a Labour stronghold that includes the constituencies of Jeremy Corbyn and Emily Thornberry, seem confident that rain and occasional thunder and lightning havenâ€™t damaged their chances of success. The â€™s David Pegg, who is anchored in deepest Islington, reports: Despite comments from Nigel Farage earlier in the day anticipating that the bad weather could favour the leave campaign by putting off â€œsoft remainersâ€\\x9d, local activists canvassing outside schools and stations in an effort to reach parents and commuters said they felt positive. â€œTurnout appears to have been fairly high. An awful lot of people are saying â€˜Iâ€™ve already votedâ€™,â€\\x9d said Freddie Wilkinson, leafleting outside Highbury and Islington station. â€œThere are quite a few people trickling in,â€\\x9d said Jo Wood, one of a group of Labour party members out campaigning. â€œPeople are voting.â€\\x9d Results for the area are expected to be declared after 1.30am, making it one of the earlier counts for London. That #usepens hashtag continues to trend on Twitter, with some gentle (and not so gentle) mockery of the urgings from some (mainly pro-Brexit) quarters for voters to bring their own pens to ensure their papers are not altered in favour of a remain vote. Read Esther Addleyâ€™s piece from earlier on one of the more curious trends of todayâ€™s poll. The conversations are still going on in south Wales, reports the â€™s Steve Morris. In Cardiff campaigners have set up next to the statue of Aneurin Bevan â€“ Labour party icon and architect of the NHS. They believe the turnout in central Cardiff is very big â€“ and think this is good news for Remain - but worry that it may be a different story in the valleys and out in the countryside. They just spoke to someone who was still undecided. â€œIâ€™ll give it some thought,â€\\x9d she said. Sheâ€™d better hurry up. Welsh Labour grandees are still working hard in the valleys, one of their traditional strongholds. Unlike other parts of the UK, their job has been made more pleasant by warm sunshine. So, are the polls going to get it right this time? The â€™s Tom Clark has been looking at how the EU referendum is the pollstersâ€™ big chance to regain some credibility. Hereâ€™s a snatch The big flaw unveiled in the thorough post-election inquiry for the industry, by Prof Patrick Sturgis, has not been satisfactorily addressed. The root problem, he found, was not last-minute jitters in the ballot box or inadequate turnout filters, but rather a brute failure by the pollsters to interview the right people. A couple of door-to-door surveys run by academics and published long after the event did get election 2015 right. The big difference was that these surveys picked out votersâ€™ names at random, and then kept hammering on their doors until they answered. The other polls, whether online or phone, give up on the hard-to-reach, move on to other phone numbers and email addresses, and thus fail to achieve a genuine mix. In 2015 it transpired that Tories, for whatever reason, were that bit harder to rouse, creating the big polling miss. Read on here. For those having trouble getting home because of the weather, Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s too late to apply for an emergency proxy â€“ the deadline was 5pm today. It seems unlikely that transport problems would be accepted as a valid reason anyway, as people stranded overseas today because of the strike by French air traffic controllers were told they were not entitled to appoint an emergency proxy. The guidance on such proxies for the EU referendum says they apply when someone has a medical emergency or â€œyour occupation, service or employment means that you cannot go to the polling station in person, and you only became aware of that fact after the proxy vote deadline (15 June)â€\\x9d. When my colleague Mark Tran asked the Electoral Commission about the possibility of people stranded at train stations getting emergency proxies, they referred him to this tweet by the commission. Itâ€™s Ben Quinn here picking up the baton now from Haroon. Red Bulls at the ready? Very high turnouts have been reported in the back yard of the only pro-Brexit MP in Bristol, Charlotte Leslie. Clerks in polling stations on council estates, littered with leave signs, said that they were â€œnot as high as 75%, but closeâ€\\x9d. In posher districts at one polling station, the was told that, including postal votes, â€œ1,000 of the 1,400â€\\x9d had been cast â€“ but this was â€œnot as highâ€\\x9d as other nearby counts. Bristol, considered a pro-remain stronghold, is one of the last big counts to declare with a result due at 6am. If the national result is very close â€“ as some predict â€“ then Britain could be waiting to see what happens in the city to find out whether the country remains or leave the EU. West Yorkshire police have confirmed that they were called to a stabbing near a polling station in Huddersfield at 5.15pm, but said the incident had nothing to do with todayâ€™s referendum. The polling station on Waverley Road was closed for half an hour to â€œcontain the sceneâ€\\x9d, but has now reopened. Local reports have named the victim as 18-year-old Luke Joseph and say he was stabbed by a gang of five other teenagers. Police believe he was attacked in the nearby Greenhead Park and then walked to the polling station, where he collapsed. The victimâ€™s injuries have been described as serious but not fatal. The problems at London transport hubs could potentially affect the ability of thousands of people to vote. Waterloo, where there appears to be no service at all, serves 90 million passengers a year, which is about 250,000 a day on average (although the average obviously includes weekends and holidays). Cannon Street, Charing Cross, London Bridge, Victoria, and probably other stations have also been affected. They are all major commuter stations with many people likely to have left for work this morning before polls opened. The Rail Delivery Group says among the train operators affected are Abellio Greater Anglia, Gatwick Express, Southern, South West Trains and Thameslink. Among those stranded is the broadcaster and journalist Sian Williams: A reader has got in touch to say that turnout may not be high everywhere: Scotlandâ€™s chief returning officer, Mary Pitcaithly, has predicted overall turnout in Scotland will reach about 70-80% after a day of â€œsteadyâ€\\x9d voting at polling stations. Pitcaithly told BBC Radio Scotland she did not expect turnout to reach the 85% seen in the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014, which she oversaw, but agreed it would still be high. Only 56% of Scotlandâ€™s 4 million-strong electorate turned out for Mayâ€™s Holyrood elections, but 71% did so in last yearâ€™s UK general election. The chief executive for Falkirk council, she is due to announce Scotlandâ€™s regional result after collating the count data from 32 local councils at around breakfast time. The storms have brought Waterloo station to a standstill, potentially affecting thousands of passengers who may not have voted. The station is a major hub for people commuting from outside London many of whom would likely have left in the morning too early to vote. Many people have taken to social media to express concern that they will miss the 10pm deadline. More on the pens saga from PA, which reports that police were called to a polling station where a woman was handing out pens to fellow voters after a volunteer reported a â€œdisturbanceâ€\\x9d. A Sussex Police spokesman said: Police were called to Durnford Close, Chichester, at around 12.25pm on Thursday 23 June by a volunteer reporting a disturbance outside a polling station. A PCSO [police community support officer] who was in the area went to the scene and spoke with a woman who was handing out pens. No offences were committed and it was not being treated as a police matter, the spokesman added. Concerns have been expressed on social media that votes not written in ink could be rubbed out and altered. There are some interesting tweets about turnout coming through: Schools in Bristol, painted as a great remain heartland, ran mock referenda today. Of course itâ€™s not the real thing and only a bit of a laugh but there was an interesting split. In the affluent northern suburb at Redland Green school, of the 475 staff and pupils who voted, 440 backed staying in the EU. Thatâ€™s 93% of the vote. Meanwhile in the less well-off southern fringe of Hartcliffe, students were more evenly split. Pupils at Bridge Learning Campus in Hartcliffe backed remain. Some interesting constituency by constituency figures are coming out of Northern Ireland that show voting is slow in republican areas while unionist districts are recording higher votes. In North Down - the most affluent constituency in Northern Ireland - polling stations were reporting that 22% of the electorate had voted by lunchtime today. North Down usually records one of the lowest electoral turnouts in Westminster and Stormont Assembly elections. In sharp contrast, by midday one polling station in the republican heartland of West Belfast was reporting a 7% turnout. Meanwhile in republican/nationalist-dominated Derry, turnout was about 11.5% by lunchtime in the Foyle constituency. Overall the Electoral Office in Northern Ireland expects the region-wide turnout to be close to 70%, which would be 15 percentage points higher than last monthâ€™s election to the devolved assembly. South Belfast, regarded as the most liberal constituency in Northern Ireland, was reporting voting turnout of up to 21% in some polling stations by the middle of the day. After the BBC reported earlier this week that poll station staff were receiving â€œtraining in what a selfie isâ€\\x9d, with the hope of preventing photography while people vote, it appears smartphones are posing a threat to the privacy of poll booths. Taking a photo inside a polling station is not of itself against the law but section 66 of the Representation of the People Act says: No person shall communicate at any time to any person any information obtained in a polling station as to the referendum answer for which a voter in that station is about to vote or has voted. Many social media users have taken photographs, including Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley. Smith tweeted a photograph of his completed ballot paper. The tweet received a mixed reception from other users, with several suggesting he had committed electoral misconduct. Here is a round-up of the key developments so far today: At least two polling stations had to be moved and people voting at others had to wade and/or be helped through deep waters, as torrential rain fell on parts of London and the south-east, causing severe travel delays and flooded homes. A poll of polls by Britain Elects put the likely outcome as 51% for remain and 49% for leave. The final pre-polling day poll, by Ipsos-Mori, gave the Remain camp a four point lead. It is believed to be the first to be published while voting was taking place. All the final phone polls showed remain in the lead, whereas the last four online polls were split with two putting remain ahead and two putting leave in the lead. The pound hit a new high for the year and shares closed up in a volatile dayâ€™s trading, indicating investors are expecting a remain vote. The pound and FTSE100 surged in the morning, fell back in the afternoon and then rallied again later, albeit not reaching the peaks during morning trading. Vote Leave has been criticised for an email warning that the referendum could be decided by voters in London and Scotland â€œdespite the heartlands of the country voting to leaveâ€\\x9d. The email also included a a photo of a queue outside a polling station captioned a â€œleafy London suburbâ€\\x9d. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a member of the official remain campaign, said the message was divisive, describing it as â€œutterly disgracefulâ€\\x9d. A council has urged voters not to use pens when they cross their EU referendum ballot papers as it could cause them to smudge. East Northamptonshire council issued the warning after a conspiracist meme encouraged pro-Leave voters to take pens to vote so that their pencilled-in crosses could not be tampered with. Most of the key figures in the campaign, including David Cameron, Michael Gove, Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Nigel Farage cast their votes early. As he left a polling station in Islington Corbyn said: â€œThe bookies usually get it right [but] they got it wrong on me big time last year, didnâ€™t they?â€\\x9d The referendum has been the biggest political betting event in history. Betfair said it took Â£5m on the result this morning. What happens after polls close at 10pm? Hereâ€™s how we expect the night to play out, from the leave heartlands of the northern counties and the east coast, to the remain cities of London, Edinburgh and Bristol. Investors have put their money on a vote to remain in Britainâ€™s EU referendum, with the pound hitting a new high for 2016 and the FTSE 100 share index rallying strongly. As the market exuberance of recent trading sessions continued throughout polling day itself, there were, however, fresh warnings that investors were setting themselves up for heavy losses in the event of a Brexit when the outcome of the referendum becomes clear on Friday. The pound broke through $1.49 against the dollar for the first time since December before shedding some of those gains in afternoon trading to stand at $1.4799 (still up 0.6% on the day). The FTSE 100 index of leading shares added a solid 1.2%, or 77 points, to close at 6338 - the highest for eight weeks. Chris Saint, senior analyst at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown Currency, said: Clearly the key issue now for currency markets is whether rising expectations that the status quo will prevail are well-placed. Most of the results from the local counting areas are expected by the early hours of tomorrow morning with the official outcome anticipated by around breakfast time. Dramatic exchange rate swings are to be expected regardless of the result, with a sharp drop in the poundâ€™s value possible in the event of a Brexit. Shares and the pound were higher from the open and got an extra fillip in morning trading after the publication of an Ipsos Mori poll conducted for the Evening Standard newspaper showed a four-point lead for remain. â€œEven though we all know that polls can be rubbish, the markets seem quite happy that the remain camp has done enough to win,â€\\x9d said Kathleen Brooks, research director at spread-betting firm City Index. It may be polling day but there is no respite from the bitterness between the two opposing campaigns. Stronger in Europe has hit out at a plea by Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliot, sent by email to Brexit supporters, urging them to vote, because: There is a very real chance that voters in London and Scotland will vote to keep us in the EU today despite the heartlands of the country voting to leave. The email includes a photo of a queue outside a polling station in a â€œleafy London suburbâ€\\x9d. Chuka Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham, said: Vote Leave are ending this campaign as they began it â€“ by seeking to divide our country not unite it, turning regions, nations and communities against one another. Londoners and Scots have as much right to exercise their democratic choice as anyone else. Implying that our votes are somehow less legitimate than those cast in other parts of Britain is utterly disgraceful. Pollsters have suggested that the elderly are more likely to vote and more likely to vote â€œleaveâ€\\x9d. So the vote by Keith Adamsâ€™s mum today may come as little surprise but it was the way she exercised her democratic right that got it trending on Twitter. Twitter users all across the country appropriated Adamsâ€™ post to tell people what their 93-year-old mums are contributing to the poll station, from the serious to the utterly bizarre: â€œKeithâ€\\x9d and â€œ93 yr mumâ€\\x9d have both trended on Twitter today. Adams has since written a blog post in response to trolling he received as a result of his post, condemning his critics for their â€œentire premise...that being brexit invalidates anything elseâ€\\x9d. Earlier the pound surged to a 2016 high against the dollar and also appreciated against the Euro but it has fallen back this afternoon: One of my colleagues, Maya Wolfe-Robinson, has been told that an inability to get back to vote because of strike action on the continent is insufficient reason to be allowed an emergency proxy. Others appear to have the same problem: Thatâ€™s it from me for now. Iâ€™ll be back on in the early hours for the results. In the meantime Haroon Siddique is poised to take over. Earlier we highlighted this lovely gallery of quirky polling stations up and down the land from the â€™s picture desk. Weâ€™re also starting to receive pictures from readers around the country. Emma Cozzi sent this, a church community centre in Hove. You can see more pictures readers have sent, including one from Stephanie Steele, who lives above her polling station in Windsor, and add yours (but please donâ€™t tell us which way you are voting) here. Amidst all the political gambling on the outcome of the referendum, William Hill points to an interesting activity in a side bet on Theresa May becoming the next Tory leader. It has halved Mayâ€™s odds from 6/1 to 3/1, making her a clear second favourite, behind 11/4 favourite Boris Johnson. William Hillâ€™s spokesman Graham Sharpe said: â€œMs May had drifted right out in the odds over recent months, finding very little support with political punters, but suddenly she seems to be back in favour and the money is hinting that she might be well placed to be a serious contender for the top job.â€\\x9d Nigel Farage is still expected at a Leave.EU party hosted by Ukip donor Arron Banks tonight, despite triggering speculation over his whereabouts by pulling out of a Channel 4 debate last night citing family reasons. Sources confirmed he had decided instead to have dinner with his son, who has been abroad for work for nine months. It also looked like he was none too keen on bumping into fellow C4 guest Alan Sked, a former Ukip leader who has been very rude about him. Farage looked chipper as he voted in his home village of Westerham in Kent this morning and is understood to have been having a relaxing lunch before getting ready for the big night. The library in Birstall, outside which MP Jo Cox was murdered seven days ago, is serving as a polling station and there is a light police presence outside. David Smith, the deputy returning officer in the area, says turnout seems high (postal voter turnout looks like it will be over 80%) and that the regionâ€™s count hall in Huddersfield will hold a minuteâ€™s silence for the MP at 11.30am. Smith says the last time he oversaw a count in the area was when Jo Cox was elected as the constituencyâ€™s MP. Fighting back tears, he says: â€œI work with politicians everyday and they have a bad press, but everything they say about her is true.â€\\x9d On the stroke of 12.50pm, the time that Cox was killed seven days ago, around 200 people gathered around the corner from the polling station in Birstall market square to take part in a vigil for the MP. Holding hands, the crowd held a minuteâ€™s silence before chanting â€œwe stand togetherâ€\\x9d and singing hymns. Paul Knight, the vicar of Birstall, who led the vigil, said Coxâ€™s death had caused the country to stop and think about the decision facing them in the EU referendum. â€œThe country paused after a very uncomfortable period of argument and exaggeration, if not untruth, and I hope that pause, though it has come about through such a tragic incident, will make people carefully think through the issues.â€\\x9d The steps of nearby Batley town hall, which was also being used as polling station, were decked in floral tributes to the MP. Turnout could be similar to last yearâ€™s general election, according to a BMG Research poll for the Electoral Reform Society [ERS]. It found that 67% of people said they would definitely vote and a further 12% said they would probably vote. At last yearâ€™s election the turnout was 66%. A high turnout is thought likely to favour remain, but the survey also found that older people who are more likely to vote leave are more likely to vote than younger people. Just 54% of 18-24 year olds said they would definitely vote today, compared to 79% of over 65s. While up on last monthâ€™s 47% for 18-24 year olds, it is still a â€œstark gapâ€\\x9d, according to ERS. Katie Ghose, its chief executive, said: â€œConsidering the fact that this is a once in a generation vote, the fact that turnout could be similar or lower than last yearâ€™s general election is a shame if true. This referendum is arguably more important than a general election as every votes counts and the result will affect the UK for decades to come. â€œA poor turnout risks people viewing this issue as unclosed, and we could see calls for further referendums or questioning of the validity of the result from either side. Nobody wants a result based on a small minority of registered voters. Instead this is an opportunity to have a decisive result, so we hope everyone gets out to vote before the 10pm deadline.â€\\x9d â€œThe demographic gap is worrying â€“ with 71% of wealthier Brits saying theyâ€™ll vote compared to just 62% of those from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, and with only half of 18-24 year olds saying theyâ€™ll vote. This referendum canâ€™t be decided by one demographic on behalf of another â€“ it needs to be the result of a great national conversation involving everyone.â€\\x9d Welsh first minister â€“ and Labour leader in Wales - Carwyn Jones has voted. Heâ€™s been campaigning hard in the Welsh valleys in recent days trying to get that Labour vote out for Remain in one of the partyâ€™s traditional strongholds. But Ukip has also been getting stronger in the valleys. It will be fascinating to find out how valleys folk have voted today. Theyâ€™ve benefitted from millions of pounds of EU money â€“ but itâ€™s easy to find people concerned about immigration here too. Remain campaigners in Glasgow have set up a wish tree in Buchanan Street to rival those set up during the independence campaign. In case you missed this from the indyref it was a charmingly empowering/nauseatingly twee device that we had a lot up here with folk leaving their wishes for an independent Scotland. Now there is one for the EUref and I feel that the circle has been fully squared: Nigel Farage has put out a final Leave.EU video appeal that picks up Boris Johnson rallying cry to make today â€œIndependence Dayâ€\\x9d. It features lots of nostalgic clips: Ian Botham winning the ashes in 1981, British troops in the Falklands, steam trains, and spitfires. Column Eastwood leader of the SDLP has used his daughter Rosa (who is one today) to make a last ditch video appeal for remain. Talking outside a local polling station in Derry city he said: â€œI want to make sure Rosa grows up in the European Unionâ€\\x9d. Weâ€™ve been asking our readers to send over their referendum day photographs and comments. Hereâ€™s a selection: Mark, 49, Cologne: The EU referendum has been in the news here a lot and Germany is fully aware of the implications whichever way the result goes. Germany does not want to see the UK leave and truly believe weâ€™re stronger together. Iâ€™m an expat who came to Germany after leaving the RAF and married my German spouse. I came over 20 years ago. Now all I can now do is sit and watch, as Iâ€™m not allowed to vote due to being away from the UK for too long. The rest of my family are all in the UK and I know theyâ€™ll be making the right decision. As for me? I will have to wait until breakfast tomorrow for the result. Naomi Tayler, 38, South Cambridgeshire: It was a busy polling station in Melbourne at 7am this morning, I was accompanied to vote by my cocker spaniel, Bella and border terrier, Daisy, who are now regular attendees at the polling station. Unfortunately the dogs were so enthusiastic they ruined a fellow voters white trousers by jumping up! Catherine Phipps, 20, Paris: Iâ€™m a student at the University of London Institute in Paris, and will be following the coverage in Paris with my other British friends who live here. None of the French people can understand why we would leave. I donâ€™t either. Chloe, 27, Harrow: My polling station has pimped up for the day with a lot of patriotic memorabilia. Is this what democracy looks like? Kate Smith, 19, Newcastle upon Tyne: Iâ€™ve only voted twice before, but both of those times I was in and out of the polling station within minutes. Today, when I arrived, there was a queue of around 15 people lined up outside â€“ it was 8am! The most encouraging thing was that of these 15 people, around two thirds were under 25. Iâ€™m so glad that my generation is engaging in this referendum, which in my opinion could be the most important decision we could make. Help us document whatâ€™s happening around the UK on polling say by sharing your stories, photos and videos here. Thereâ€™s been little sign of leave campaigner Boris Johnson today. Thatâ€™s because heâ€™s been attending his daughter graduation ceremony in St Andrews. Will he make it back to London in time to vote? A poll of polls by Britain Elects puts the likely outcome on 51% for remain and 49% for leave. Polls in the last 10 days of the campaign have been split, but the last four all have Remain ahead. Long queues have been reported outside some polling stations as voters cast their ballots in Britainâ€™s closely fought EU referendum. In London and parts of the south-east many were forced to brave torrential rain and navigated flooded streets to have their say. David Cameron ignored questions about the weather, saying only â€œGood morningâ€\\x9d as he and his wife Samantha cast their votes at Methodist Hall in Westminster. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, speaking outside his Kent home, said he believed the leave camp had a â€œvery strong chanceâ€\\x9d because of the weather, adding: â€œBut itâ€™s all about turnout and those soft remainers staying at home.â€\\x9d Voting is said to be â€œbriskâ€\\x9d across Northern Ireland in the EU referendum according to the Electoral Office in the region. Unofficially it is said the vote could be as high as 70% in the region. If this is the case it will be far higher than the turnout for the Northern Ireland Assembly elections last month which was 55%. There are 619 polling stations across the province and the votes will be counted at eight different centres before the full Northern Ireland result is declared in Belfastâ€™s Titanic Centre. North Wiltshire Tory MP James Gray (a passionate leave supporter) says if people vote to remain he will accept â€œthe democratic will of the peopleâ€\\x9d, but only if it is a â€œreasonable majorityâ€\\x9d suggestion around 60-40. Are the Leave campaigners paving the way for the next wave of campaigning if they lose? Betfair has taken Â£5m on the EU referendum this morning as punters rush to place final bets ahead of tomorrowâ€™s results. There has been a flurry of bets, predominantly on staying in the EU, according to a spokeswoman. â€œThe Scottish referendum saw nearly Â£10m traded on the day, so weâ€™re anticipating at least that amount,â€\\x9d she said. The company says it has taken Â£56m on the political event. Betfair said their biggest bet of the morning had been Â£28,500 on Remain, adding that they had had eight bets that day of Â£20,000 or more. Overall, the biggest bet theyâ€™ve seen has been Â£315,000 on remain. Itâ€™s a similar picture for Ladbrokes, which reported bets of over Â£1m in the last 24 hours. Most of the money was on the Remain side it said. The average stake on Remain is now Â£400, while the average on Leave is Â£70. A spokesperson for Coral described betting as brisk this morning, saying that there had been numerous four figure bets laid, predominantly on Remain. So far it has had one bet of Â£4,000 on Remain (at 1/4) and a Â£2,000 punt on Leave (at 11/4). â€œThe majority of bets today are for Remain, which has seen the odds on Britain staying in the EU shortening from 1/4 to 1/7, and Leave out to 4/1, from 11/4.â€\\x9d It added that while more shop customers are predominantly backing out, online ones are for stay. â€œThis reflects an older customer base who bet in shops wanting out, and the younger customers who bet online are for staying.â€\\x9d Itâ€™s a similar picture at William Hill, which makes Remain a 2/9 favourite â€“ equating to an 81% chance of winning. Thereâ€™s been flooding outside the Grange primary school in Newham, east London. Eyewitness Ben March said people were â€œhitching up their trousers and wading through the waterâ€\\x9d to cast their votes. A spokeswoman for Newham borough council said that everyone would still be able to vote, adding that teams were out trying to clear the water. There should be no problem accessing and assistance is on hand for those needing it. There were also problems in New Malden, south-west London, Merton council said. A council spokeswoman said no-one had been turned away and that staff were doing â€œeverything they canâ€\\x9d to guide voters and drivers through and clear water away. Kingston council, also, in south-west London has had to move a couple of polling stations due to the weather. Tea rooms, front rooms, mobile homes, a Buddhist centre and a launderette â€“ hereâ€™s our photo gallery of quirky polling stations. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has voted at Tonypandy in south Wales. She has been a passionate voice in the Remain campaign. But it would be fascinating if, say, Wales voted to remain and the UK as a whole voted out. Would that be a boost to nationalism in Wales? Youâ€™d think so. Down amongst the detail of todayâ€™s Ipsos Mori poll are a couple of interesting nuggets. Two weeks into the campaign the Ipsos Mori polls showed that immigration had overtaken concerns about the impact of Brexit on the economy as the issue which was the most important in helping people to decide how to vote. Last weekâ€™s poll which had a six point Leave lead had 33% of people naming immigration as the decisive issue for them. Todayâ€™s poll (which gives Remain a four point lead) still shows immigration as the issue of most concern at 32% but concerns about the impact of Brexit on economy has closed the gap to 31%. This may explain how the swing to Remain has taken place. The poll also has some interesting party breakdowns. It shows that 68% of Labour voters intend to vote Remain, but only 43% of those who voted Conservative at the general election intend to back Remain. This is what happened to the pound after the poll was published. Spainâ€™s El Mundo carries an interview with Winston Churchillâ€™s grandson, Sir Nicholas Soames. In it, not for the first time, Soames declares : â€œMy grandfather would have voted to remain.â€\\x9d Sticking with the second world war theme, the El Mundo journalist Alberto Rojas has posted some very stirring footage shot for the film 1969 film Battle of Britain. The accompanying tweet reads: â€œI preferred it when the British were trying to free Europe rather than trying to abandon it.â€\\x9d The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, also scrambled the Spitfires earlier this week. Thereâ€™s more on European press coverage here. The first Brexit copycat has emerged in a country that has not yet gained entry to the EU. On the eve of the vote, Turkish president Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan suggested that Turkey could hold a referendum over whether to go on with its long-stalled and rocky accession process to join the bloc. â€œWe can stand up and ask the people just like the British are doing,â€\\x9d Erdogan said in an angry speech late on Wednesday after breaking the Ramadan fast at an official dinner. â€œWe would ask â€˜Do we continue the negotiations with the European Union or do we end it?â€™ If the people say â€˜continueâ€™, then we could carry on.â€\\x9d He has repeatedly accused the bloc of rejecting Turkey on the grounds that it is a Muslim-majority country. Ankara has also been angered by comments from David Cameron during the bruising Brexit campaign, suggesting that Turkish membership was not even â€œremotely in the cardsâ€\\x9d and that the country may not join until the year 3000. Brexit dominates Italyâ€™s front pages, deemed â€œEuropeâ€™s longest dayâ€\\x9d by La Repubblica and business daily Il Sole 24 Ore. Romeâ€™s top paper, Il Messaggero, carries a bleak image of the â€œanxiety and fear of the British, divided on the destiny of the Kingdomâ€\\x9d. It says the climate in Britain has become even more poisonous since the murder of MP Jo Cox. The staunchly anti-EU Il Giornale carries a photo of a â€œKeep Calm & Vote Leaveâ€\\x9d van, declaring that whoever wins, Brussels has lost. The Italian papers have also noted prime minister Matteo Renziâ€™s pro-Remain article in the . Hereâ€™s a summary of where things currently stand just over five hours since polls opened: People heading to polling stations to vote had to wade through deep waters, as torrential rain fell on parts of London and the south-east, causing severe travel delays and flooded homes. London fire brigade said it had dealt with a dayâ€™s worth of calls in just 90 minutes, including buildings struck by lightning and flooded shops and homes. The final pre-polling day poll gave the Remain camp a four point lead. The Ipsos-Mori poll is believed to be the first to be published while voting was taking place. All the final phone polls showed remain in the lead, whereas the last four online polls were split with two putting remain ahead and two putting leave in the lead. Most of the key figures in the campaign, including David Cameron, Michael Gove, Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Nigel Farage cast their votes early. As he left a polling station in Islington Corbyn said: â€œThe bookies usually get it right [but] they got it wrong on me big time last year, didnâ€™t they?â€\\x9d The pound and shares have soared as investors await the result. Traders have been watching the EU referendum closely for weeks, and many will be working through the night as the results come in. The referendum has been the biggest political betting event in history. What happens after polls close at 10pm? Hereâ€™s how we expect the night to play out, from the leave heartlands of the northern counties and the east coast, to the remain cities of London, Edinburgh and Bristol. Help us document whatâ€™s happening around the UK on polling day by sharing your stories, photos and videos. Show us whatâ€™s been happening in your community and at polling stations around the country. If youâ€™re following the election from outside of the UK, tell us how and why. Weâ€™ll feature your stories throughout our coverage, so get in touch. You can share your photos and experiences by clicking on the blue â€˜Contributeâ€™ button at the top of the live blog. Remember that sharing pictures of yourself or whatâ€™s happening before you go into or after you leave the polling station are great, but please donâ€™t take pictures or video of yourself inside the polling station, as publishing it to Witness or social media could be a breach of the law. Also please do not tell us how you voted or how you intend to vote as we will not be able to publish your contribution until after the polls close at 10pm. More about pencils (number 2 on the Cowley list). A trusted contact of our North of England editor Helen Pidd, emailed this: â€œI run a polling station and it is very noticeable how many voters today are bringing their own pens and even sharpies to register their vote rather than use the pencils provided in the booth. Worrying lack of trust in the counting system and I assume someone has put out some sort of rumour that votes made in pencil can be erased, which as you know is ridiculous. Professor Briain Cox, Britainâ€™s favourite scientist, quipped: Spaniards tend to be very proud Europeans, which is one of the reasons thereâ€™s so much interest here in the referendum. But thereâ€™s another very, very strong reason why Spanish eyes are fixed so firmly on the UK today. As this graphic from the online Spanish newspaper El EspaÃ±ol shows, almost a third of the tourists who came to Spain in May were British. Last year, British tourists spent â‚¬14bn in Spain - or â‚¬444 a second. If Brexit happens, the paper notes, the pound is likely to tumble in value and British holidaymakers will be less happy to splash their cash. The article bears the headline: â€œThe graphic that makes Spanish tourism shake over Brexitâ€\\x9d. The LibDems lit up the foot of Edinburgh castle with a Remain messages. LibDem leader Tim Farron made a final plea to voters. He said: â€œToday is about the very future of Britain; itâ€™s about the kind of country we want to be: an outward looking, tolerant and progressive nation, leading in Europe. â€œBut the result today is still on a knife-edge, and we absolutely must not let the likes of Nigel Farage and Michael Gove have their way. The very tone of their campaign should tell us enough about what they would do to our country. â€œSo thatâ€™s why I need you to go to the polls and cast your vote for Remain. I need you to vote with the prosperity and opportunity of our future generations at the forefront of your minds.â€\\x9d In what is believed to be the first ever poll published on polling day, Ipsos Mori gives Remain a four point lead. The phone survey was completed in the days before the referendum. Mike Smithson, an election analyst at politicalbetting.com points out that all the final phone polls showed Remain in the lead, whereas all but one of the online polls show Leave in the lead. One of the methods was wrong, we just donâ€™t know which yet. As predicted by Cowley (number three on his list of things to watch), weâ€™re seeing a lot of dogs at polling stations. Now spotting dogs at polling stations has become Twitterâ€™s favourite pasttime on polling day. This year, as with last yearâ€™s general election, #dogsatpollingstations is one of the top trends. Ukip leader Nigel Farage joked with reporters that he had been â€œundecidedâ€\\x9d how to vote as he arrived at a polling station in a primary school near his home in north Kent. Spainâ€™s acting prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has taken an unequivocal line on Brexit, warning earlier this month that a leave vote affect the hundreds of thousands of Britons who live in Spain and â€œwould be very negative for everyone and from every perspectiveâ€\\x9d. Divorce from the EU, he stressed, would see British citizens forfeiting the rights to live and work across the continent. However, pro-independence politicians in Catalonia â€“ who long for a break with Madrid â€“ are taking a far more nuanced approach. Although most people in Spain are strongly pro-European, Catalan separatists recognise that Brexit could help set a precedent for how the EU deals with a reconfigured Europe. RaÃ¼l Romeva, the Catalan minister for foreign affairs said: â€œCatalonia has been following with great interest the debate that is taking place these days in the UK and its possible outcome. British citizens have been given the opportunity to compare all the various points of view before voting freely on what kind of relationship they want their country to have with the European Union. This is beneficial for any democracy: it reinforces it and makes it stronger.â€\\x9d Whatever the result, adds Romeva, the referendum has shown that citizens are â€œfree to decide on their sovereignty in a democratic wayâ€\\x9d. â€œEurope has always adapted itself to new realities. We have seen it in the past, we will see it now with the United Kingdom and we will continue to see it in the case of Catalonia.â€\\x9d Cataloniaâ€™s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, recently told the that he saw many parallels between the rhetoric deployed by the Remain campaign and language used to counter moves towards Catalan independence. â€œWe have also suffered campaigns of fear,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI remember when the banks started issuing their opinions. They treated us as if we were not grown-ups and said a whole lot of lies.â€\\x9d Puigdemont also downplayed suggestions that the UKâ€™s departure from the EU would tear apart the union, saying: â€œThe EU will make an extraordinary display of political realism, and an admirable, Darwinian ability to adapt.â€\\x9d Google Trends has been looking at what UK internet users have been searching for in connection with the referendum. The top issues by local authority revealed that â€˜immigrationâ€™ (in red) was very prominent all over the country, but so too was the â€˜NHSâ€™ and the search term â€˜Expatsâ€™. â€˜Tradeâ€™ and the â€˜economyâ€™ were less prevalent. The leave campaign has covered more of provincial and rural England in its efforts to persuade Britons to quit the EU, while the remain side has concentrated on urban centres. Analysis by the , which pinpoints campaign stops made by four prominent campaigners on either side of the debate in the five weeks to 16 June, shows the leave side has largely ignored Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, while the remain camp has been absent in a large swath of eastern England. For the analysis the looked at the itineraries of four campaigners on the remain side: prime minister David Cameron, chancellor George Osborne, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow first secretary of state Angela Eagle and, on the leave side, Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, Ukip leader Nigel Farage and Labour MP Gisela Stuart. It also shows that both sides have, in the main, chosen to campaign in areas broadly supportive of their respective views. In north-west England, for example, the remain campaigners have concentrated on the larger urban centres, Liverpool and Manchester, both of which are rated â€œrelatively Europhileâ€\\x9d by YouGov. Looking a little quiet on the Isles of Scilly at the moment. Scilly Sergeant Colin Taylor is making sure thereâ€™s no foul play in the far south west of Britain. The Isles of Scilly could be one of the first places to have a result. Usually at elections ballot boxes are taken to the mainland for counting but for the referendum it will be done on St Maryâ€™s. Only 1,700 voters so it shouldnâ€™t take that long. Over in the City, shares have hit their highest level since late April as investors remain glued to the EU referendum vote. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares jumped by 1.5% to a two-month high, before dipping back a little, as Brits headed to the polling booths. Mining stocks and financial firms are among the risers. Traders have been watching the EU referendum closely for weeks, and many will be working through the night as the results come in. Yesterday, UBS bank predicted that Â£350bn would be wiped off leading shares if the Leave campaign won. The pound is also rallying this morning, hitting a six-month high of $1.4851 against the US dollar. Analysts have forecast that it could plunge to $1.30 after a Brexit victory. Our business liveblog has more details: The Leave camp has a â€œvery strong chanceâ€\\x9d of pulling off one of the biggest political upheavals of recent times, Ukip leader Nigel Farage has insisted. Speaking outside his Kent home, Farage told PA: â€œActually I do think we are in with a very strong chance, I do genuinely. But itâ€™s all about turnout and those soft Remainers staying at home.â€\\x9d Who knows what happened in the privacy of the voting booth? Hereâ€™s video of Labour leader and reluctant remain campaigner before and after casting his vote in Islington. â€œThe bookies usually get it right,â€\\x9d Corbyn is heard to mutter, before adding â€œthey got it wrong on me big time last year, didnâ€™t they?â€\\x9d Justice secretary and leading Leave campaigner, Michael Gove, has voted in Kensignton. He was accompanied by his wife Sarah Vine, the Daily Mail columnist who is the godmother to David Cameronâ€™s youngest daughter. Note the Vote Leave brolley. ThorbjÃ¸rn Jagland, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said he hoped Britons would choose to stay in, but said Europe would deal with the issue in a â€œrational wayâ€\\x9d if the verdict was to leave, writes Saeed Kamali Dehghan in Oslo. â€œI was chairing the committee that awarded the Nobel peace prize to the European Union so the answer is evident [on where I stand] but I really hope that the UK would stay. I also believe that if we get the opposite result, Europe has to deal with it in a rational way, so Europe will survive,â€\\x9d he told the . â€œIt is up to the people of United Kingdom to decide, itâ€™s a democratic referendum, we have to respect that but I hope results would be clear,â€\\x9d he added. He said the UK wonâ€™t be isolated if it decided to leave. â€œBritish islands will continue to exist and British people will continue to exist as part of Europe, so whatever happens we cannot start isolating each other in Europe once again, it would be ridiculous.â€\\x9d The referendum dominated Norwegian front pages on Thursday. â€œToday Britain can split Europe,â€\\x9d read the headline of Aftenposten newspaper. The cartoon on the newspaperâ€™s front page showed Boris Johnson trying to pull a sword out of a European stone that would make him king. â€œFears that emotions will take Britain out of the EU,â€\\x9d read the front page headline of Dagens NÃ¦ringsliv, one of the biggest newspapers in Norway. Labour activists are reporting brisk early business at polling stations in the south Welsh valleys, where the party has been working hard to get the vote out in one of its traditional heartlands. But the result in Wales is going to be fascinating following Ukipâ€™s excellent showing at the assembly elections last month when the party took seven seats. More than 2.2m Welsh voters are eligible to take part in the referendum and will be casting their votes at 3,578 polling stations. Results will be declared locally in each of Wales 22 council areas â€“ from Monmouthshire in the far south-east to the Isle of Anglesey in the north west. The overall figures will be collated and announced in Flintshire in the north-east. The Welsh rugby great Gareth Thomas has announced that he has voted for the first time in his life â€“ and reveals that he was heavily influenced by actor Michael Sheen and former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell. â€œCan always blame them,â€\\x9d he said in a Tweet. Gibraltarâ€™s pro-remain chief minister Fabian Picardo has cast his vote. Polls suggest that 85% of the island want to remain in the EU. Last week Picardo told the : â€œThere is quite unprecedented unity here. Myself and all my predecessors, every political party, all the trade unions and employersâ€™ organisations, every club, society and association â€¦ For Gibraltar, this is a slam dunk decision. Now that the leave camp has made it clear that they are not looking for Britain to remain a part of the European single market, the choice for Gibraltar has become very stark.â€\\x9d In his ten things to watch Philip Cowley warned us to be careful of reports of high turn out (see earlier). But we canâ€™t resist having some anecdotal reports from respected sources (what else can we write about on polling day?). Cowley is keeping a beady and wary eye on such reports. Only two UK referendums have had higher turnouts than recent general elections, the Institute for Government Points out. These were the one on the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998 (81.1%) and on Scottish independence in 2014 (84.6%). Scotlandâ€™s first minister Nicola Sturgeon voted early. Axel Scheffler, the illustrator behind the Gruffalo, has created an image for the to demonstrate his support for Britain remaining in the EU. Edinburgh council has reported that nearly a fifth of the cityâ€™s 345,000 voters have already submitted postal votes in the EU referendum, with more than 82% of the cityâ€™s postal voters returning their ballot paper by Wednesday evening. The city has a high number of registered postal voters at 22%. The number returned so far does not include late submissions â€“ postal votes can be handed into polling places on polling day. That 82% interim turnout is close to the 86% UK average for postal vote returns in the 2015 general election. Remains campaigners are out in force in the West End and Partick areas of Glasgow, with the leave camp conspicuous by their absence around polling stations. But Iâ€™m told thatâ€™s because Leave are concentrating on their get out the vote operation. Plus, the student/middle class/SNP make-up of the area probably doesnâ€™t speak to their core support. Polling station officials report a steady flow of voters, no doubt encouraged by the bright sunshine, though not yet teaching the high watermark of 2014â€™s Scottish independence referendum. Landmark buildings across Europe, including in Madrid and Warsaw, have been lit up with a Union Jack to show support for the Remain campaign, according to video from the Business Insider. Hereâ€™s video of David and Samantha on their way to vote in central London. Leading leave campaigner Boris Johnson has told the Telegraph that todayâ€™s vote is more important to him than his future in British politics. â€œFrankly, if this is the end of my political careerâ€¦ Iâ€™ve done eight years as mayor of London, I enjoyed it hugely, it was a massive privilege. Fine by me.â€\\x9d But he remains fairly chipper about the outcome. â€œOur campaign has been about optimism and self-reliance. This is an absolute turning point in the story of our country because I think if we go on with being enmeshed in the EU it will continue to erode our democracy. That is something that worries me.â€\\x9d Boris spent part of the final day of campaigning kissing fish at Billingsgate. Steve Bell features Boris kissing fish in outer space in his latest If... cartoon. Both David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn have cast their votes. Philip Cowley, who teaches politics at Queen Mary University of London, has 10 things be wary of today. Reuters has followed up that front page promise by the German tabloid Bild to recognise Englandâ€™s disputed goal in the 1966 world cup final. Germanyâ€™s Bild newspaper promised on Thursday that Germans would not hog hotel sunloungers and would ditch their goalkeeper for the next penalty shootout, playing on friendly stereotypes in a last-ditch plea to Britons to stay in the European Union. â€œDear Brits, if you remain in the EU ... then we ourselves will recognise the Wembley goal,â€\\x9d Bild declared above a picture of Geoff Hurstâ€™s controversial extra-time goal in the 1966 World Cup Final, when the English soccer team beat West Germany. Touching on decades of rivalry on the soccer pitch, the paper said Germany would go without its goalkeeper in the next penalty shootout between England and Germany. Germany is considered by English soccer fans to be their main sporting rival. Germany defeated England in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup and the semi-finals of the 1996 Euros. Leaning on decades of jokes between the countries, the mass-selling tabloid promised to put towels on sun loungers to reserve the best spots for Britons by the hotel pool, and to not use suntan lotion out of solidarity with sunburnt Brits. If Britain were to stay in the EU, Bild also pledged to supply the baddie for every James Bond film, put its clocks back one hour so they were on the same time zone as Britain and introduce an EU guideline that bans froth on beer. Earlier this month, Germanyâ€™s Der Spiegel published a bilingual edition of its weekly magazine in English and German containing a strong appeal for Britons to vote to remain One voter said she had to be carried into a flooded polling station. Police said they were not expecting trouble as tens of millions of Britons are expected to vote in Thursdayâ€™s referendum. Despite a bitter and heated campaign, police said they expected a peaceful day. Police commanders have been issued with extensive guidance on how to minimise the chances of electoral fraud with police chiefs keen not avoid getting caught up in the rancour surrounding Brexit. A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council said: â€œWhile there is currently no intelligence to suggest issues will arise around Thursdayâ€™s poll, police forces are monitoring the situation locally and putting appropriate plans in place to ensure a fair and peaceful electoral process.â€\\x9d No voting problems reported so far in Barnet. The London borough has a lot to prove after hundreds of people, including the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, were turned away at last monthâ€™s elections after a voting register blunder. The Sun and the are diametrically opposed on the referendum, but both papers used views from space on their front pages to make their differing cases. The Sun has Britain heading for the sunny uplands on â€œIndependence Dayâ€\\x9d - the rallying cry of leave campaigner Boris Johnson. While the wants us to stay in the European Union - light pollution and all. Meanwhile, the Mirrorâ€™s front page looks in the other direction â€“ down a deep hole in the earth â€“ to warn readers of what it sees as the perils of Brexit. Iâ€™m handing over this live blog now to Matthew Weaver, whoâ€™ll cover the next several hours of polling day. Our live coverage runs right through to polls closing at 10pm and beyond, when Andrew Sparrow returns to catch all the results being churned out and turn them into sense. Iâ€™ll also be back on Friday morning for those key counts. Thanks for reading and for the many comments. The early morning weather in Glasgow is radiantly sunny, with all that is inferred to mean for turnout. The Scottish papers are well aware of the importance of this countryâ€™s predicted EU-phile tendencies today, with the Scottish Daily Mail declaring that â€œScotland holds the key to Brexitâ€\\x9d and the Daily Recordâ€™s front-page banner urging readers to vote remain. Elsewhere Scottish party leaders have been reminding their Twitter followers to vote, while Ukip MEP David Coburn has been urging voters to #useapen in case those dastardly pencils given out at polling stations are a cunning ploy from remain to (literally) rub out his sideâ€™s support. Weâ€™ve yet to see how committed pro-independence supporters in Scotland react to Farage et al co-opting the hashtag #independenceday. As the UK votes on whether to stay in the EU or leave, the sent seven photographers to capture the mood in various European communities who have made their home in the UK, from a Greek Orthodox church to a German bierkeller. Whichever way youâ€™re voting, these images are a beautiful way to kick off your day: Thereâ€™s only one important item on the agendas of investors across the world today. Britain is heading to the polls after a lengthy, bitterly fought campaign to decide if she stays in the European Union, or should leave. Traders in the City are preparing for a lengthy shift â€“ perhaps staying late into the night, or returning to the office early tomorrow morning. Friday is likely to be one of the most dramatic and volatile trading sessions in many years, especially if the public choose to leave the EU. Analysts have predicted that the pound could slump by 15%, while shares would probably suffer big losses. Voting has just begun, with pollsters saying that the result is hard to call â€“ especially as around 10% of voters are still undecided. If youâ€™re planning to stay up for the results tonight, you need to plot your day carefully. Sleep might, after all, be needed at some point. So my colleague Jessica Elgot has come up with this nifty hour-by-hour guide, starting from 10pm: Polls will close, and on election nights this is normally the moment broadcasters show their exit polls and make their projection for the night ahead. However, that wonâ€™t happen this time as thereâ€™s no exit poll for this referendum. Some banks are said to have commissioned private exit polls, but they will be kept for their employees. So if anyone tells you they know whatâ€™s going to happen at this stage, theyâ€™re a chancer, unless they are an eagle-eyed watcher of sterling derivative markets. Sky News has commissioned a survey from YouGov of people previously polled, asking how they voted on the day. This will be released at 10pm, but this is not, repeat not, an exit poll and shouldnâ€™t be treated like one. Of course, itâ€™s not just London and south-east England that have weather. Other parts of the UK are also entitled to have weather. Theirs is rather better today: With the polls telling us that around 10% of voters are still unsure how they will cast their ballot, you could perhaps do worse â€“ OK, not much worse â€“ than go by the roll of a dice. (Pedantic readers, please note: I know it should be a die, but that reads oddly and Iâ€™m trying to keep things cheerful.) Voter Andy Roe tells the Oxford Times that heâ€™ll decide by tossing his homemade cube: The dice idea came into my head when David Cameron said â€˜we must not roll a dice to decide out childrenâ€™s futureâ€™. Everybody will be doing that because of misinformation. Most people will be metaphorically throwing a dice â€“ we donâ€™t know what will happen either way. Here he is with his unnecessarily large cube. Democracyâ€™s a funny thing. Will rain in London and south-east England put off voters today? Spectacular thunder and lightning overnight might have caused a few to oversleep this morning, but the bigger problem is likely to be travel disruption caused by heavy downfalls and flash flooding in some areas. The London Fire Brigade says it received a dayâ€™s worth of calls in just an hour and a half to reports of weather-related incidents including lightning striking property, flooded homes and businesses and rising waters trapping vehicles. On the London underground, the District line, DLR and Overground were all suspended or delayed because of flooding. Gatwick Express southbound services have been suspended, and South West Trains, Southern and TFL Rail are also suffering major delays. Outside London and south-east England, the weather is expected to be fine and settled today. Yes, itâ€™s here: the day youâ€™ve been dreaming of/dreading; the day you didnâ€™t believe would ever really happen. Polling stations open this morning for those who havenâ€™t already posted back their ballots (hello, decisive and organised voters!) to cast their cross to remain in the European Union or leave. Here Iâ€™ve rounded up all you need to know for the long day ahead. Then this live blog â€“ steered by me and a cast of colleagues â€“ will take you through until polls close this evening, at which point Andrew Sparrow climbs into his seat for a night of results. Do come and chat in the comments below or find me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. The big picture The last few hours have been strewn with final pleas â€“ and if the polls are correct in saying the percentage of those voters still undecided could be in double figures, there might yet be receptive ears for those pleas to fall upon. So here they are, in a nutshell. David Cameron: â€œIt is a fact that our economy will be weaker if we leave and stronger if we stay â€¦ Put jobs first, put the economy first.â€\\x9d Boris Johnson: â€œDemocracy is vital but it only works when you can kick the buggers out when they make a mistake. If we vote to leave we can take back control of our democracy and our immigration policy.â€\\x9d Nicola Sturgeon: â€œI believe in independence for countries but I also believe independent countries must work together for the greater good â€¦ If we vote remain, we protect them; if we donâ€™t vote remain, then we put all of these things at risk.â€\\x9d Gordon Brown: â€œThis is not the Britain I know, this is not the Britain I love. The Britain I know is better than the Britain of these debates, of insults, of posters.â€\\x9d Yvette Cooper: â€œWhat the leave campaign have done is push lies and also pit human beings against other human beings. That is what is wrong, immoral and just not British.â€\\x9d Andrea Leadsom: â€œTomorrow we will either wake up to the bright freedom of our independence day, or to the humdrum drudgery of just another day under the newly triumphant eye of the Brussels bureaucracy.â€\\x9d Nigel Farage: â€œLetâ€™s stop pretending what this European project is: they have an anthem, they are building an army, they have already got their own police force, and of course they have got a flag. At the end of the day â€¦ when people vote they have to make a decision â€“ which flag is theirs?â€\\x9d John Major: â€œIf our nation does vote to leave â€¦ we will be out, out for good, diminished as an influence upon the world, a truly Great Britain shrunk down to a little England, perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales, and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south by the border controls that would then be the edge of the European Union.â€\\x9d Iain Duncan Smith: â€œDavid Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people. Families are suffering the consequences of uncontrolled migration â€“ a direct result of the EUâ€™s obsession with freedom of movement.â€\\x9d Jean-Claude Juncker: â€œOut means out. British policymakers and British voters have to know that there will be no kind of renegotiation.â€\\x9d Tim Farron: â€œYouâ€™ve got to hold and give but do it at the right time. You can be slow or fast but you must get to the line. Theyâ€™ll always hit you and hurt you, defend and attack. Thereâ€™s only one way to beat them, get round the back.â€\\x9d (And in case you didnâ€™t know why the remain campaign was reminiscing fondly about John Barnes.) You should also know: Torrential rain and flooding in London and south-east have raised turnout fears. Thousands paid tribute yesterday on what should have been Jo Coxâ€™s birthday. Britons worried about the pound rush to stock up on foreign currency. But the financial sector is sure of a remain vote, despite a late FTSE dip. The referendum has been the biggest political betting event in history. A good read from Natalie NougayrÃ¨de, who says the EU seriously misjudged the British mood. And from Michael Cockerell, who documents how old pals David Cameron and Boris Johnson fell out so publicly. Poll position There wonâ€™t be official exit polls this evening, so the last-ditch forecasts are all weâ€™ll have until the real results land. And those final polls tell us that remain is ahead, that leave is ahead, and that itâ€™s neck-and-neck. ComRes for the Daily Mail and ITV News puts remain on 48%, leave on 42% and undecideds on 11% (yes, thatâ€™s 101% â€“ letâ€™s assume thereâ€™s some rounding here). With undecideds lopped off, it becomes remain 54% to leave 46%. YouGov gives In a two-point cushion, with remain leading leave by 51% to 49%. Opinium swung a notch the other way, with leave on 45%, remain on 44% and 9% still to make up their minds. And a final TNS poll also edges the Outers ahead, with leave on 43%, remain on 41% and 16% not decided or not voting at all. The FT poll of polls rounds off the campaign with remain on 47% and leave on 45%. Number Cruncher Politics â€“ which stood out in last yearâ€™s general election for actually predicting a Conservative victory â€“ now puts the probability of a remain win at 74%. What happens next Donâ€™t expect too much today, bar politicians and voters heading to polling stations. (Nonetheless, stick with the live blog, wonâ€™t you?) It all hots up after 10pm, when voting stops and counting starts. So, in Friday timings: 00.00-00.30: Expect Sunderland to declare. Theyâ€™re always super quick. Other authorities, including Wandsworth and the City of London, are also due to report early. 2am sees a big tranche of announcements, with 22 councils due to speak up around now. By 3am, weâ€™ll be two-fifths of the way through. Stay strong. Drink caffeine. At 3.30am we should hear from a number of Scottish authorities, including Edinburgh and Aberdeen. 4am: 88 authorities announce their counts. We might wonder if we can make a guess at this point. Donâ€™t hold us to that. 5am: 90% of the way there. You might start to think about sleep. Hang on. By 8am, we really should know the result. Have breakfast. Toast with a bucks fizz. Drown sorrows. Call in sick. Go to bed. Read these Paul Mason, writing on Medium, says a vote to remain is not a mandate for the â€œneoliberal, anti-democraticâ€\\x9d EU: On Friday, with the referendum over, I will join with radical and progressive movements across Europe to oppose your austerity strategy and the political cant that justifies it â€“ aka neoclassical economics. And I will go on fighting the austerity imposed by the UK government â€¦ I hope remain wins tomorrow. But the problem will still be there: neoliberal austerity promoted by the European Union is destroying the values of Europe. A generation of young people is being taught to despair and fear the future. For this reason I will push for a mandatory re-run of a referendum on EU membership every seven years. I encourage the peoples of all other countries to exercise this right regularly. Juliet Samuel in the Telegraph writes in defence of the referendum campaign: For all the fear and anger and viciousness, I believe voters will make the right decision. Iâ€™m not referring to which way theyâ€™ll vote. I mean that voters broadly understand, either instinctively or rationally, what the arguments are and where they stand. Weâ€™ve heard time and time again in this campaign how â€˜confusedâ€™ the public is and how desperate for â€˜factsâ€™ voters are. Esteemed commentators have wrongly concluded that this makes people unqualified to vote on such a serious matter. The opposite is true. The insatiable desire for â€˜factsâ€™, the endless letters and phone-ins and questions, tell us that voters know they are not hearing definitive predictions, but points of view and spin. They would like certainties, but they have not heard anything that amounts to one. And so they know that their vote in the referendum is really just a judgment call: whom do I trust? What risk can I bear? And, fundamentally: what do I value? Max Colchester and Jenny Gross in the Wall Street Journal win fascinating fact of the day with news that residents of the Isle of Man cannot vote in the referendum (but Gibraltarians can): The debate over Brexit, as Britainâ€™s potential exit from the EU is known, isnâ€™t simple. Neither is figuring out who gets to cast a vote. During world war one, the UK passed laws allowing â€˜British subjectsâ€™ from across the empire to vote in UK general elections. The empire crumbled but the rights live on. People from some 53 countries can vote in the referendum as long as they live in the UK or Gibraltar, a British territory off the tip of southern Spain. People residing in Gibraltar canâ€™t vote in general elections but got a pass for this one â€¦ The Isle of Man counts as abroad â€¦ Today, it is a â€˜self-governing Crown dependencyâ€™, which means it isnâ€™t part of the UK, even though Britain is responsible for its foreign affairs. The day in a tweet Well played, Germany: they donâ€™t think itâ€™s all over. If today were a song ... All the polls would tell us it has to be Europeâ€™s The Final Countdown. But no! What do the polls know, anyway. Letâ€™s go for the Hokey Cokey instead: in, out, shake it all about. Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about.

              "  'When I got my Top of the Pops break, Mum got me new pyjamas My father was sitting by the fire, with a transistor radio in his lap. At the age of 57, Don Bradley was listening to John Peel for the first time in his life. His new found interest in Radio 1â€™s finest was sparked by his sonâ€™s band making a record that immediately fell under the patronage of Peel. It was 1978. The Undertones had recorded Teenage Kicks that summer. It was a big deal for us, still playing every weekend in a bar in Derry and finally achieving what few of our fellow citizens had ever done. Making a single (an EP, no less) and getting it reviewed in the NME and played on national radio. Not that I made a big deal of it at home. The ninth of 11 children, I realised early on that you were allowed to go ahead and do what you wanted, as long as it didnâ€™t cost money and was unlikely to land you in hospital or in prison. My parents were not liberal bohemians, though. Don and May Bradley were strict practising Catholics, which could account for my having 10 siblings. Mass on a Sunday, fish on a Friday, television switched off during Holy Week. No rules about punk rock, though. The only advice my mother gave me when I started to hang around with friends who would become the Undertones was to stop slouching. I was a couple of inches taller than Billy, John and Vincent and she said, in a not unkind way, that I was starting to stoop. A subconscious effort to blend in. She was also the first to say to me that long hair was on the way out. This was early 1976 and I suspect it was a ploy to get my shoulder-length mop into some kind of order, rather than a premonition of future trends. My father was an accordion player (button key, harder to learn than the piano key version) who played with a local ceili band. Fifteen years before Teenage Kicks, Charlie Kellyâ€™s Ceili Band made the occasional appearance on BBC TV and I remember being allowed to get out of bed and come downstairs to the front room when they were on screen. Even with the aerial held just so, I found it hard to pick him out, especially as he wore a bow tie and a white shirt. He never wore the bow tie when he was going to work as a storeman at a local farm supplies co-op. It was hard work, especially on the mornings after a late night ceili in some far flung corner of Ireland. But he did it without complaint or talk of television studios. When it came to my turn in music, I took that attitude from him. Maybe too much. I never officially told him or my mother that I was in a band called the Undertones. One morning I did say that someone from Sire Records in London was coming over to see us play. Not in a conversation, though. I just said it out loud and hoped that someone would pick it up in the middle of everything else that was happening at home. Dinners, cleaning, worrying about money. It was noted, though. When I got the word the band were appearing on Top of the Pops, my mother did her bit by buying me a new set of pyjamas. No words of warning about London, about behaving myself or about signing my life away. None were needed. Although she did introduce me to the phrase â€œliving in each othersâ€™ pocketsâ€\\x9d, which made sense when we broke up five years later. A couple of decades on and my 18-year-old son is playing jazz on the drums in our front room. Heâ€™s very good, although he stops as soon as I open the door. â€œVery good,â€\\x9d I volunteer, although Iâ€™m really there to let him know that his dinner is on the table. I know not to talk too much about what heâ€™s playing, what heâ€™s listening to, what his band are up to. Thatâ€™s the conversation that happens with other teenagers, not with a 56-year-old parent. â€¢ Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone by Michael Bradley is published by Omnibus Press, Â£16.99.

              "  'UK unlikely to stay in single market, Tory document suggests Britain is unlikely to be able to remain a member of the single market, according to a document photographed in the hands of a senior Conservative official on Downing Street. A handwritten note, carried by an aide to the Tory vice-chair Mark Field after a meeting at the Department for Exiting the European Union, could be seen to say: â€œWhatâ€™s the model? Have cake and eat it.â€\\x9d And in a further embarrassment, it added â€œFrench likely to be most difficult.â€\\x9d It also suggests that a deal on manufacturing with the EU should be â€œrelatively straightforwardâ€\\x9d but admits that services, such as in the financial or legal sectors, are harder. One idea cited in the note is a â€œCanada-plusâ€\\x9d option, suggesting Britain could look to replicate the free trade deal hammered out by the EU over seven years with Ottawa. However, it suggests that the UK would be seeking â€œmore on servicesâ€\\x9d than was agreed in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (Ceta). A government spokesperson distanced Theresa May from the document, saying: â€œThese individual notes do not belong to a government official or a special adviser. They do not reflect the governmentâ€™s position in relation to Brexit negotiations.â€\\x9d However, the fact they appeared to have been taken during a meeting with officials or even ministers â€“ given Mayâ€™s tight-lipped approach to the negotiating strategy â€“ means that they will be pored over. The woman carrying the document appears to be Julia Dockerill, chief of staff to Field, who is vice-chair of the Conservative party, working on international issues and MP for the Cities of London and Westminster. Field does not have a formal Brexit role but does take a keen interest on the impact that leaving the EU could have on the countryâ€™s financial services, many of which are based in his constituency, and is likely to have been speaking to senior figures about this issue. The notes also said: â€œTransitional â€“ loath to do it. Whitehall will hold onto it. We need to bring an end to negotiations.â€\\x9d That could suggest that ministers are not keen to enter a transitional deal after the end of the article 50 period, despite May hinting last week that this would be possible. Other comments include: â€œDifficult on article 50 implementation â€“ Barnier wants to see what deal looks like firstâ€\\x9d, in reference to lead negotiator Michel Barnier. â€œGot to be done in parallel â€“ 20 odd negotiations. Keep the two years. Wonâ€™t provide more detail,â€\\x9d it adds. â€œWe think itâ€™s unlikely weâ€™ll be offered Single Market.â€\\x9d The document appears to reflect a discussion about the prospect of a trade deal like that of Norway, which is a member of the European Economic Area. â€œWhy no Norway â€“ two elements â€“ no ECJ intervention. Unlikely to do internal market.â€\\x9d That appears to refer to the drawbacks of taking on the Norwegian model, which has the country outside the EU and its customs union, but inside the single market. The reason Brexit supporters do not want to follow that idea is the requirement that Norway accepts free movement of people and is under the jurisdiction of the European court. The document was being carried out of 9 Downing Street, the Brexit department, and into No 10 Downing Street when it was photographed. It comes after reports that there is a sign on the DExEU exit doors reading: â€œStop! Are your documents on show?â€\\x9d. It emerged on Monday that the government faces the prospect of a second legal challenge to its Brexit plans, with the group British Influence threatening a judicial review over whether leaving the EU means Britain must also automatically leave the European Economic Area and hence lose the free trading benefits of the single market. However, the government and senior EU legal experts have claimed that this attempt is unlikely to be as successful as the high court ruling that parliament must have a vote before the Brexit process begins, which is the subject of an appeal by the government in the supreme court that is due to be heard next week. Despite the denial about the note, it is likely to increase pressure on the government to lift the secrecy about its plan for Brexit, with opposition MPs complaining that there should be full transparency about the UKâ€™s plans. Stephen Gethins, the SNP spokesman on Europe, said the notes reveal a government â€œwith no direction, and no clueâ€\\x9d. â€œWorryingly, those in favour of taking us out of the EU appear set to cut off their nose to spite their face â€“ with an apparent call to end any negotiations with Europe before theyâ€™ve properly begun and already wishing to pull the plug on the prospect of transitional arrangements,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThese scribbled papers, however scant, seem to be the only plan the UK government has and stand starkly in contrast to the very clear plans set out by first minister Nicola Sturgeon in the aftermath of the EU referendum. â€œIf they werenâ€™t so deeply troubling, these revelations would be risible. Public patience has worn thin with stonewalling and obfuscating from the UK government â€“ itâ€™s now high time they set out a proper plan on leaving the EU as opposed to hastily jotted down notes, so short on substance.â€\\x9d Tim Farron, leader of the Lib Dems, added: â€œIf this is a strategy it is incoherent. We canâ€™t have our cake and eat it and there is no certainty on the single market. This picture shows the government doesnâ€™t have a plan or even a clue.â€\\x9d May has so far only promised to talk about her broad aims before triggering article 50 in March, and thereby officially notifying the EU of the UKâ€™s intention to leave. She has made clear that there will have to be more controls on immigration from the EU and wants to see an end to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice â€“ which is why many think Britain will come out of the single market. But the lack of further details from No 10 has alarmed many formerly pro-EU Labour and Tory MPs, who are increasingly cooperating in an attempt to stop a â€œhard Brexitâ€\\x9d. Their key demands are staying as close to the single market as possible, a transitional deal to cushion the economic effect of leaving and more parliamentary scrutiny of the negotiations. Some former remain politicians, including former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major, are even pushing for a second referendum to allow the public to vote on or even veto any deal for leaving the EU. It was also reported in the Sunday Times that Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, backs a transitional deal with the EU to cushion the impact of Brexit for businesses until at least 2021.',\n",
              "  \"Up really is down on Mummy Leadsom's amazing journey The centenary of the Somme isnâ€™t many peopleâ€™s idea of a good moment to promise â€œit will be all over by Christmasâ€\\x9d. But Andrea Leadsom isnâ€™t just any old person. Sheâ€™s a mother. A mother with a strong interest in grandchildren. Even though she hasnâ€™t got any yet. But she has met some and she likes them a lot. Having won the referendum war largely thanks to the votes of the over 40s, Leadsom has suddenly developed a keen interest in children and grandchildren. At her Conservative leadership launch, her eyes moistened and her voice became breathier every time she said â€œchildren and grandchildrenâ€\\x9d. Which was about once or twice a sentence. The message: â€œAnyone who doesnâ€™t have children is evilâ€\\x9d was subliminally beamed on to the wall behind her. Itâ€™s pure coincidence that Theresa May doesnâ€™t have children. Leadsom wants to reassure the UKâ€™s children and grandchildren she has always had their best interests at heart and that everything is going to be absolutely fine. Donâ€™t worry your pretty little heads. Trust mummy. Trust wannabe granny. All those nasty people who have been scaring you that separation from the EU would be long and painful have got it wrong. Itâ€™s a doddle. All we have to do is say to the EU we want this and we want that and the EU will give it to us. Most things will go through on the nod. Simples. Everything will be fixed by Christmas. Earlier, possibly. Apart from those bits that wonâ€™t. This might all have come as news to the Leadsom of 2013 who was certain that Brexit would be a disaster for the economy and cause a decade of uncertainty, but she wasnâ€™t at all keen to explain herself. â€œIâ€™ve been on an amazing journey,â€\\x9d she said, channeling an X Factor contestant who had just been kicked off the show. Itâ€™s amazing what a touch of Koolâ€“Aid and personal ambition can do. From Andrea to Pollyanna in three very easy years. But then Pollyanna has a great deal to be Pollyanna-ish about right now. Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson were the cheerleaders-in-chief at her launch at the Cinnamon Club, one of Westminsterâ€™s top restaurants. IDS is the man who once thought he was the right person to be leading the Tory party and Paterson is the environment secretary who was outwitted by 250 badgers. Sheâ€™s also the preferred candidate of Arron Banks, Ukipâ€™s largest financial donor. She is a magnet for all the rightwing oddballs whom most Tory MPs try to keep at armâ€™s length. In any sane world, their support should be a guarantee of failure. And yet sheâ€™s one of the frontrunners to challenge the favourite, Theresa. Just as confusing, no one seems at all bothered that one official described her as the worst minister the Treasury had ever had. Up really is down. Standing in front of a sign that read andREALeadsom â€“ who knew that 2012â€™s Perfect Curve actually existed? â€“ Pollyanna sounded like a particularly unconvincing Lance Corporal Jones from Dadâ€™s Army. And anything but REAL. â€œPlease donâ€™t be afraid,â€\\x9d she said, struggling to contain her sense of panic and bewilderment at being the centre of attention. â€œWhat we need to remember is that the Hun doesnâ€™t like it up â€™em. We havenâ€™t stopped loving our children and grandchildren. We havenâ€™t abandoned love. We have just rediscovered our freedom to hate the people we donâ€™t like.â€\\x9d People who donâ€™t have children being first in the queue. Pollyannaâ€™s voice caught. Her leadership bid wasnâ€™t about personal ambition, as she had plenty of cash tucked away after years of working in the City; it was about doing the best for the countryâ€™s children and grandchildren. â€œOne of my key appointments will be a minister for housing,â€\\x9d she insisted. â€œAnd I will do my very best to keep him in post for the duration of the parliament.â€\\x9d That wasnâ€™t exactly the firmest of commitments. Pollyanna also went on to declare her passion for social justice, a passion that didnâ€™t quite extend to revealing whether all her family tax affairs were onshore. All in good time. â€œMy concern is for the emotional health of our nation,â€\\x9d she concluded. â€œAnd I am better prepared than anyone to deliver that. We are the mother of all parliaments and I am the mother of all mothers.â€\\x9d And one day she would be the grandmother of all grandmothers. There was as little detail in Pollyannaâ€™s speech as there had been in every other Tory leadership bid. All she knew for certain was what she didnâ€™t know. She didnâ€™t know if there was going to be a cut-off point for EU migrants being allowed to stay in this country; she didnâ€™t know who was going to be in her great negotiation team for the negotiations that wouldnâ€™t need to take place because they would be over by Christmas; and she definitely hadnâ€™t a clue why so many people thought she might make a good leader. In another part of Westminster, Liam Fox launched his own leadership campaign. A futile gesture was a far more fitting way to mark the centenary of the Somme.\",\n",
              "  'The view on the UK labour market: farewell, Lithuanian car valets The main reason behind the leave vote on 23 June, at least according to the polls, was to take back control â€“ to repatriate lawmaking powers from Brussels to Westminster. But if that was the emotional appeal, the most tangible prospect was of an immigration policy made in Britain. The challenge that now faces British politicians â€“ in particular the government, which is committed, in the prime ministerâ€™s words, to making Brexit mean Brexit â€“ is to work out how to respond to votersâ€™ fears in a way that is clear and transparent and economically viable too. That means balancing freedom of movement with access to the single market. A result, in Brexit terms, must be fewer EU workers. That, however, raises another set of difficult questions: questions about who will do the jobs that EU workers were coming to the UK to do, and what they will be paid. Britainâ€™s infamous low-wage sectors â€“ agriculture and food processing, clothing manufacture and retail, domestic services â€“ are already facing two significant new pressures. The national living wage is already in play and will increase hourly wages to approximately Â£9 an hour by 2020. Then, from next May, for larger employers, the apprenticeship levy will also be applied. If, in addition, there are fewer EU workers, that is likely to mean more upward pressure on pay. Some employers are already clawing back other benefits in response to the living wage, and warning of existential threats. Contemplating the consequences of Brexit is clarifying the real impact of the movement of 21st-century labour. The latest research from the Resolution Foundation summarises the impact of high levels of migration from the new accession countries after 2004. It acknowledges that those who argued that migration was an unmitigated good, growing the economy to the benefit of all, overstated their case â€“ almost as much as did those who argued that migration was invariably harmful. The latter were right that in low-paying sectors, wages were held down. But EU migrants also tended to contribute more in taxes than they received in benefits. Maybe the biggest impact is contradictory: it concealed the other marked development in the period, particularly after the 2008 crash â€“ the wider stagnation of wages. Of course, pay was not the only reason that migrant workers came to be so resented. Queues for doctorsâ€™ appointments and overcrowded classrooms were easier to see than differences in pay, and they played a bigger part in fuelling resentment. Yet in the same way that migration concealed structural change in wages, its impact on public services served as a distraction from the real cost of the austerity measures brought in by the coalition government in 2010. What is already becoming clear, and will only become clearer as EU membership is more fully examined, is that Britainâ€™s labour market does not function well. If EU migration has held pay down, it ought to follow that pay will go up in response to the labour shortages that are likely to be the consequence of a cut in migration. Not so much, according to the Resolution Foundation. The original impact of cheap labour was to cut at most a few pence off wages, and only from the pay of â€œnativeâ€\\x9d workers with no qualifications; on the foundationâ€™s projections, the likely effect of cutting EU economic migration will simply reverse that. And if, as projected, the economy shrinks, it is likely to mean a downward pressure on wages that could outweigh the impact of labour shortages. In theory, scarce labour should also be an incentive to invest and modernise in a way that the plentiful supply of low-paid workers has made unnecessary until now. The teams of car valets from Lithuania will be replaced by an upgraded version of the drive-through car wash that had almost disappeared, and supermarkets will at last introduce the kind of electronic pricing system that is commonplace in France. UK productivity may even show an improvement. But it would also upend the British labour market model where high levels of employment are set against hyper-flexible working and low pay. Post Brexit, there may be fewer jobs, but they will be better paid. So far, so good. But there are much wider consequences, not least for millions of local authority workers and the councils that pick up their wages bill. There is a crisis already in the care home sector, and the NHS is in the grip of its worst ever cash shortage. Faced with challenges like this, the government will have to take some hard decisions about how it meets its pledge to the Brexiteers.',\n",
              "  'Jermain Defoe hat-trick sees Sunderland sink 10-man Swansea When the dust settles on this extraordinary match â€“ and that could take a while â€“ the referee will cease to become the main talking point for Swansea City and the threat of relegation will start to bite. Graham Scott, who was asked to take charge of the game at short notice after Andre Marriner pulled out on Monday, looked totally out of his depth at this level, yet the erroneous decisions that impacted on both teams were of little concern to Sunderland come the end. Inspired by the evergreen Jermain Defoe, who completed his hat-trick five minutes from time and took his tally to five in two games in the process, Sunderland picked up the most precious of victories to move within one point of Swansea and give their survival hopes a huge boost. It was a crazy, helter-skelter game and one that was overshadowed by some calamitous refereeing from a man who was officiating only his fourth Premier League game. Defoe looked to be offside when he gave Sunderland a third-minute lead and it should not have been a penalty when Wes Brown was penalised for fouling AndrÃ© Ayew later in the first half. Then came arguably the defining moment in the match when Scott sent off Kyle Naughton in the 37th minute for a challenge on Yann Mâ€™Vila that was not worthy of a free-kick never mind a straight red card. The full-backâ€™s studs were high but he clearly got the ball and only Mâ€™Vila knows why he was rolling around. Although that harsh decision initially galvanised Swansea, who went 2-1 ahead through a superb Ayew goal shortly before the interval, Sunderlandâ€™s numerical advantage eventually told. Patrick van Aanholt, who was excellent on the left flank, hauled Sunderland level with a deflected shot and from that point on it was all about Defoe. Alan Curtis, Swanseaâ€™s interim manager, was bitterly upset and felt Scottâ€™s decision to send off Naughton was the turning point. â€œIâ€™m disappointed. I think the big talking point is the refereeâ€™s decisions,â€\\x9d Curtis said. â€œI wonâ€™t say it has cost us as you donâ€™t know how it will play out but it has had a major bearing on the game. Unfortunately the referee did look out of his depth. â€œWe were fortuitous with the penalty decision for us. But when he makes a huge decision to send a player off we were forced to play the next hour with 10. You only have to look at the video and Kyle won the ball cleanly. It is something we will try to appeal in the morning.â€\\x9d Allardyce had some sympathy for Swansea and Naughton on that occasion â€“ he looked across at Curtis and appeared bemused as well as amused when Scott showed a red card â€“ but he also made the point Sunderland were on the wrong end of a bad call with the Ayew penalty incident. â€œScott only stepped in because the referee who was supposed to referee the game was ill,â€\\x9d the Sunderland manager said. â€œIn his defence before the game Scott pointed out: â€˜I know how big this game is for both of you and Iâ€™ll try and manage it the best way I can.â€™ But things happen under pressure and when people are under pressure they make mistakes.â€\\x9d The referee was not the only one who blundered. Lukasz Fabianskiâ€™s terrible goalkick led to Sunderlandâ€™s opener when he drilled the ball straight to Adam Johnson, who fed Fabio Borini on the left. Boriniâ€™s low shot was parried by Fabianski and Defoe, who had strayed into an offside position, tapped home. Gylfi Sigurdsson levelled from the spot after Scott deemed Brown had tripped Ayew when the Ghanaian had actually stubbed his foot into the ground. Three minutes after Naughtonâ€™s dismissal Swansea were in front when Ayew, sprinting on to Fabianskiâ€™s measured kick, beat Lee Cattermole and struck home a sumptuous left-foot angled drive that flashed into the far corner. With an extra man, Allardyce urged his players to press higher up the pitch in the second half and Sunderland quickly got reward when Van Aanholt cut inside and thumped an 18-yard shot that took a wicked deflection off Federico FernÃ¡ndezâ€™s back and went in off the far upright. Defoe, running on to Johnsonâ€™s fine pass, then beat Fabianski to grab his second â€“ again the striker appeared offside â€“ before later turning in Van Aanholtâ€™s cut-back for his third. â€œJermainâ€™s a massive player for us and converted most of the chances we created,â€\\x9d Allardyce said. â€œAnd irrespective of some of the refereeâ€™s decisions weâ€™ve gone and won away in an enormous game for both of us because weâ€™ve gained three points on everybody that is above.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'From Afar review â€“ compelling film-making This assured first feature from Venezuelan director Lorenzo Vigas is a masterclass in storytelling through image rather than words. The photography, particularly the eloquent use of shallow focus and the eye for subtle body language, delivers stabs of clarity to a portrait of an ambiguous relationship between a man in his 50s and the teenage gang leader he meets on the streets. Armando (played by the great Chilean actor Alfredo Castro, a regular collaborator of Pablo LarraÃ\\xadn) is coolly inscrutable, the bitterness resulting from some hinted-at childhood trauma etched deep into his watchful face. He is gay but prefers his sexual encounters, like everything else in his life, at a safe distance. He scopes the streets of Caracas for young men, takes them back to the shadowy secrets of his apartment, but never touches them. One day he spots Elder (Luis Silva). The teenager lashes out, both with homophobic invective and with his fists, but thereâ€™s an uneasy fascination between the mismatched couple which draws them together. When I first saw this picture at the Venice film festival, where it won the top prize, I felt that it suffered in comparison to the similarly themed Eastern Boys (2013) by Robin Campillo. On a second viewing, however, while it lacks the propulsive narrative drive and tonal shifts of Eastern Boys, From Afar reveals itself to be every bit as compelling a piece of film-making.',\n",
              "  \"Remain camp will win EU referendum by a 'substantial margin', says campaign chief Lord Rose - Politics live A total of 84,000 EU migrant families on tax credits would have been affected by David Cameronâ€™s â€œemergency brakeâ€\\x9d if it had been introduced four years ago, official figures reveal. The number â€“ released by HMRC six months after it was first requested by the â€“ appears far smaller than had been suggested by the prime minister in previous public statements justifying the plan. Lord Rose, chair of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, has said that his side will win the EU referendum campaign by â€œa substantial marginâ€\\x9d. (See 3.26pm.) He made the claim in a lunch to the press gallery. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said Rose was out of touch with public sentiment. Elliott said: The cosy establishment club doesnâ€™t want change because it does well out of the status quo. But the people want change and to take back control. Itâ€™s a David vs Goliath struggle - but we all know who ended up winning that one. Asked about claims that boasting like this could be counterproductive (see 3.28pm), a campaign source said that voters wanted to identify with a winning side - but also that Rose was not a politician, and that he was inclined just to speak his mind when answering questions. John Baron, a Conservative MP, has said that parliament will become â€œnothing more than just a chamber of Europe, a council chamberâ€\\x9d if it does not assert its sovereignty. He was speaking in a debate on a backbench motion saying parliament should have the power to block unwanted EU legislation. The debate was dominated by Conservative backbenchers known for their opposition to Britainâ€™s membership of the EU. An opinion poll in Scotland suggests the SNP still have a huge lead over Labour ahead of the Scottish elections in May. The TNS-BRMB survey shows the SNP on 57% in the constituency section, Labour on 21% and the Tories 17%. In the regional list section the SNP is on 52%, Labour 19% and the Tories 17%. The SNPâ€™s Derek Mackay said: Labour woes are continuing in the face of the partyâ€™s rank incompetence north and south of the border â€“ and with their plans to shift the burden of Tory austerity onto workers by hiking taxes on the low paid, their situation is only going to get worse. Two major road tunnels across London could significantly ease congestion, the capitalâ€™s mayor, Boris Johnson, has said as he unveiled proposals to send more traffic underground. The EUâ€™s top court has told the home secretary, Theresa May, she cannot deport a Moroccan mother with a British-born son simply because she has a criminal record.The advocate general of the European court of justice has told May that it will be contrary to EU law if she automatically expels or refuses a residence permit to a non-EU national with a criminal record who is a parent of a child who is an EU citizen. As Alan Travis reports, the preliminary opinion of the courtâ€™s advocate general, Maciej Szpunar, however, adds that while, in principle, deportation in such cases was contrary to EU law, he agreed with UK representations that there should be exceptional circumstances when a convicted criminal could still be deported depending on the seriousness of the offences involved. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the â€™s Politics Weekly podcast, featuring Alberto Nardelli, Anne Perkins, Rafael Behr, Dan Roberts and Hugh Muir talking about the Iowa caucuses and the EU renegotiation. The Out campaigns are continuing their circular firing squad act. Arron Banks, the co-founder of Leave.EU, has just put out this statement. Leave.EU initially welcomed the news that Vote Leave wanted to call a truce and work together. However, it is now crystal clear that they have zero interest in joining forces. Cummings, Elliott and their MPs have now been offered the the chance to form a united front five times, and on each occasion our overtures have been rejected outright. For Cummings and Elliot this is a business, not a cause. Danny Finkelsteinâ€™s excellent analysis of the situation is sadly correct. I am angry that this group is jeopardising this historic referendum through their dishonesty and unwillingness to embrace and work with all the Brexit groups. Itâ€™s time they and the Conservative MPs associated with them decide if itâ€™s their career or their country which matters most to them, and then they can either fit in with the rest of us or quite frankly disappear. Banks seems to be referring to the announcement this week about Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott stepping down from the Vote Leave board. Cummings, an abrasive character, was seen as an obstacle to a merger between Vote Leave and Leave.EU and, after it was announced that Cummings and Elliott were leaving the board, Banks repeated his offer to merge the two organisations. But Banks himself is not Mr Diplomacy. This is what he tweeted about the news that Lord Lawson was becoming chair of Vote Leave. In his statement Banks is referring to this column by Daniel Finkelstein in the Times (paywall). In it, Finkelstein described the alternative visions for Britain outside the EU put forward by Vote Leave, which is backed by the Ukip MP Douglas Carswell, and Leave.EU, which is backed by mainstream Ukippers, including Nigel Farage. The vision of Carswell and his allies, including the Tory MEP Dan Hannan, is that we need to leave the EU because it is out of date. We must be an open, free market, free trading nation, linked to the English speaking world, powerful in global trading bodies. The Leave message should be optimistic, daring and broad ... Voters are concerned about Britain losing control of its own policy, but when asked what aspect of control they are most concerned about, overwhelmingly they answer immigration. Their grasp of what the EUâ€™s other powers and structures may be is, letâ€™s just say, weak. Yet many of Carswellâ€™s Vote Leave allies donâ€™t actually believe in strong immigration controls at all. They are free marketeers who see the benefits of free movement of workers ... This is the great advantage of the Leave.EU campaign. It appreciates the centrality of immigration to the case for quitting. It has a very different outlook from the Carswell-Hannan group. It is much more pessimistic, much more focused on what Britain has lost and stands to lose. It doesnâ€™t want some new English-speaking, free market internationalism. How much better would that be than the EU? It thinks the EU is too newfangled, not too modern. Iâ€™ve asked Number 10 to elaborate on why Erna Solderg, the Norwegian prime minister, thinks the â€œNorwegian optionâ€\\x9d wonâ€™t work for the UK if it leaves the EU. (See 12.29pm.) A spokeswoman said that Soldberg simply made that point in her talks with David Cameron. The spokeswoman said she could not say any more about Soldbergâ€™s reasoning. UPDATE: Downing Street have come back to me to say this is what Cameron said about the â€œNorway optionâ€\\x9d at PMQs in October last year. Some people arguing for Britain to leave the European Union, although not all of them, have pointed out a position like that of Norway as a good outcome. I would guard strongly against that. Norway pays as much per head to the EU as we do and takes twice as many migrants per head as we do in this country, but has no seat at the table and no ability to negotiate. I am not arguing that all those who want to leave the EU say that they want to follow the Norwegian path, but some do and it is very important that we are clear in this debate about the consequences of these different actions. Hereâ€™s the New Statesmanâ€™s George Eaton on Lord Roseâ€™s claim that the In side will win the EU referendum easily. Lord Rose, chair of Britain Stronger in Europe, gave a speech at a press gallery lunch earlier. Here are some of the main points. Rose said he expected the In camp to win comfortably. He floated the idea of banning the publication of polls just before the referendum. He said Cameron was considering doing TV debates. He said the In campaign were running a â€œProject Realityâ€\\x9d, not a â€œProject Fearâ€\\x9d. Rose, the former M&S chairman, also had a good joke at his own expense, prompted by his recent memory lapse. On the World at One Daniel Mitov, the Bulgarian foreign minister, said Bulgarians living in Britain were worried about the proposals in the draft EU renegotiation. He said that the negotiations were still going on, and that there was a need for some â€œpolishingâ€\\x9d, particularly in terms of how the emergency brake would work. But, despite being twice asked if Bulgaria was threatening to veto the plans, he declined to make that threat. Bulgaria wanted to see a reasonable compromise, he said. As Nicholas Watt reports in the today, David Cameron has said that the government will introduce some measure to assert the sovereignty of parliament. This will happen alongside the EU renegotiation, and will particularly appeal to Boris Johnson, the Conservative MP and mayor of London who has been calling for this for some time. In his story, Nick says two options are being considered. A few hours later, after the exchanges in the House of Commons, it became clear that the prime minister is prepared to deal with Johnsonâ€™s concerns on two levels. The prime minister is expected to: Declare that the UK supreme court or another official body should be vested with powers akin to those of the German constitutional court, which has the right to assess whether legal acts by the EUâ€™s institutions remain within the scope of the powers of the EU. Cameron first floated this idea in a speech at Chatham House in November after Johnson had outlined in a private plea to the prime minister to his calls for an assertion of parliamentary sovereignty Propose a possible fresh act of parliament to make clear that the UKâ€™s agreement to the primacy of EU law â€“ which dates back to 1972 â€“ was gifted by parliament and could therefore be withdrawn by parliament. In the Times today (paywall) Lord Neuberger, president of the supreme court, said setting up an alternative constitutional court would be a mistake. He told the paper: One of our great advantages compared with most of Europe is that we have a very simple system of courts and I think replicating the civil, European system of having a supreme court and a constitutional court â€” a supreme administrative court â€” is just a recipe for complication, for cost and for unnecessary duplication. And Lord Pannick QC, the prominent human rights lawyer, told the paper that giving the supreme court a constitutional role would be pointless. For our supreme court to be given a function similar to that of the German constitutional court would not have any practical effect. The proposal has no legal merit. It may have a useful political purpose for the government, but the prime minister should be careful about raising expectations that will not be achievable. Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, was asked about this on the World at One. When the comments in the Times were put to him he insisted that it was worth clarifying the position of UK law in relation to EU law. Thereâ€™s always been a discussion about constitutional precedence here, which law take precedence. Iâ€™m not a lawyer, but Iâ€™ve read a lot of stuff about this and there are a lot of very eminent lawyers saying that there are ways to address this issue; maybe not the perfect solution, but there are ways to assert the supremacy of our parliament and to give us a much stronger position than we have had in the past. And I think as this discussion goes forward we will want to see these ideas discussed and explained in full. Hammond also hit back at David Davis, rejecting his claim that the emergency brake â€œwould not stop a push bikeâ€\\x9d. (See 9.42am.) I think David Davis is wrong and, frankly, those people who are not looking for a good deal with Europe but are looking to argue for Britain to leave Europe, and whatever the package contained would be looking for Britain to leave Europe, are obviously going to attack whatever the package contains. But it does contain significant measures that will change the way the European Union works. The Leave.EU campaign has hit back at the suggestion from the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Soldberg, that the â€œNorway optionâ€\\x9d could not work for the UK. (See 12.29pm.) A spokesman said that it was not true to say that, if Britain were in EFTA and the EEA but outside the EU like Norway, it would have no say in drafting EU rules. There is an enormous network of discussion and consultation even within EFTA/EEA, on a global and regional level, long before these rules ever get near a statute book. The UK would be an active part of this network, along with over 190 international bodies. EEA/EFTA representatives participate in over 500 committees and expert groups involved in what is known as â€œdecision shapingâ€\\x9d at single market level. Above EU level, EEA/EFTA representatives have their own seats on many global bodies which we cannot as EU member states. Number 10 has rejected a claim from Alan Johnson, chair of the Labour In For Europe campaign, that the â€œemergency brakeâ€\\x9d allowing the UK to stop EU migrants getting in-work benefits for up to four years will have no impact on immigration. Johnson made the claim in an interview on the Today programme. But the prime ministerâ€™s spokesman told journalists at the Number 10 lobby briefing that it would make a difference. Migrant families were able to claim Â£6,000 a year on average in tax credits, he said: I think common sense would tell us that reducing the financial incentive will reduce that pull factor. As the Press Association reports, the spokesman was also unable to say whether migrants from wealthier EU states, such as Luxembourg, might end up receiving more generous child benefit payments than their British neighbours under the plan to give them child benefit at their home country rate, not the UK rate. The Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg has said the â€œNorway optionâ€\\x9d would not work for the UK if it leaves the EU, Number 10 has said. (See 12.29pm.) The Conservative MP David Davis has said that the emergency brake â€œwould not stop a push bikeâ€\\x9d. (See 9.42am.) Analysts at Goldman Sachs are warning that sterling could fall by up to 20% if Britain votes to leave the European Union. Ukip has been accused of â€œbaseless scaremongeringâ€\\x9d after it used a party political broadcast on the BBC to warn of the dangers of Turkey joining the EU, highlighting its Muslim population and claiming 15 million of its citizens could migrate to the UK. David Cameron has said that the international community must raise billions of dollars more than last year to alleviate the unacceptable plight of Syrian refugees. He was speaking ahead of todayâ€™s Syria donor conference. For more details, do follow our separate live blog which is covering it. Labour could lose up to Â£8m a year as a result of the governmentâ€™s changes to trade union funding, Iain McNicol, the partyâ€™s general secretary, has revealed. Sir David Dalton, the senior NHS boss trying to resolve the junior doctors dispute, has written to all of the 45,000 trainee medics involved in a last-ditch attempt to avoid next weekâ€™s planned strike. MPs have called for the head of a self-described neo-masculinist movement to be banned from the UK as a minister blasted him and his group as â€œabsolutely repulsiveâ€\\x9d. A series of events planned by the Return of Kings group have been cancelled after Daryush Valizadeh, who calls himself Roosh V, said he could no longer guarantee the safety of anyone who wanted to attend. Responding to an urgent question about the meetings, Home Office minister Karen Bradley said the government â€œcondemns in the strongest terms anyone who condones rape and sexual violence or suggests that responsibility for stopping these crimes rests with the victimsâ€\\x9d. Responding to calls for him to be banned from the UK, Bradley said that the Home Office did not routinely comment on individual cases, but that the home secretary could ban non-British citizens if she believes their presence is â€œnot conducive to the public goodâ€\\x9d. The Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox QC has been told to apologise to the House of Commons after failing to declare more than Â£400,000 of outside income on time. Rural bus services are being wiped out in many areas of England and Wales due to cuts in subsidies, a study by the Campaign for Better Transport says. David Cameron met Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister, in Number 10 last night. Mostly they were talking about the Syria conference, but Cameronâ€™s EU renegotiation also came up. Norway is not in the EU, but it gets access to the single market through its membership of the European Free Trade Association. This means it has to submit to what is anachronistically referred to as â€œgovernment by faxâ€\\x9d because it has to comply with EU rules without having a say in how they are drawn up. According to Number 10, Solberg said this would not be a good arrangement for the UK. This is from the readout of the meeting that Downing Street has just sent to journalists. A Downing Street spokesperson said: [Cameron and Solberg] also discussed the prime ministerâ€™s work to win a renegotiated package for the UK in the European Union. Prime Minister Solberg said she supported the prime ministerâ€™s work to build a more flexible EU and to cut red tape. She also agreed with the prime minister that Norwayâ€™s position in the European Free Trade Area but outside the EU would not work for the UK. Solbergâ€™s comments - at least, her comments as mediated through Number 10 - are significant because one of the challenges for those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU is explaining what its future trading relationship with the EU would be like. Often they cite â€œthe Norway optionâ€\\x9d, but Cameron now has a new argument to deploy against that. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in Wales, will say in a speech later today that his party would cut ministerial salaries in the Welsh assembly by 10%. They would use the savings to encourage young people to get involved in politics through a national children and young peopleâ€™s assembly for Wales. After May the Welsh first ministerâ€™s salary is due to rise to Â£140,000, with other ministersâ€™ pay rising to Â£100,000, and Davies says his proposal would save around Â£250,000 over five years. Lucy Powell, the shadow education secretary, is giving a speech to an education summit in Sheffield today. In it, she says that the school curriculum does not prepare children well for the world of work and that ministers should not be personally involved in deciding whatâ€™s on the curriculum. I want to open up a conversation about how we can guarantee that future curriculums are fit for purpose. Young people have the right to a programme of study that prepares them for the modern world, with a strong connection to the needs of the economy. At the moment, this just isnâ€™t happening. Instead, under the Tories weâ€™ve seen parts of the curriculum personally drafted by the education secretary and then circulated for sign-off amongst cabinet ministers, each making the case for their own pet project to be included ... Ministerial diktat on the curriculum has gone too far and this approach is failing to meet the needs of our young people and our economy. Itâ€™s no wonder then that we now have the situation where 69 per cent of businesses and twoâ€“thirds of parents do not feel the education system prepares their children for work. It is interesting to note that, even though Michael Gove stopped being education secretary in 2014, he is still a prime target for the opposition. The complaints about ministers interfering with the curriculum primarily relate to him. Here is a classic example. A Conservative MP, Geoffrey Cox QC, has been told the apologise to the Commons after failing to declare more than Â£400,000 of outside earnings on time, the Press Association reports. The standards committee found that Geoffrey Cox QC had committed a â€œseriousâ€\\x9d breach of rules, although it accepted he had not â€œintended to hideâ€\\x9d the payments for hundreds of hours of legal work. The Torridge and West Devon MP, known as one of parliamentâ€™s highest earners, quit as a member of the committee and referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards in October after it emerged he had repeatedly missed the 28-day deadline. In its report (pdf) the committee said: â€œWe accept that Mr Cox had no intention to hide these payments and that he has not breached the requirements of the House for declaration of relevant interests. â€œNevertheless, as the commissioner notes, the number of payments and the sums involved in the late registration are significant and Mr Cox was in a position which should have ensured that he was more familiar with the rules and the relevant principles of public life in this area than other Members might be.â€\\x9d As my colleague Ben Quinn reports, the Daily Mailâ€™s â€œWho will speak for England?â€\\x9d editorial (see 10.47am) is being roundly mocked on Twitter. You can read all todayâ€™s politics stories here. As for the rest of the papers, here is the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, and here is the ConservativeHome round-up of todayâ€™s politics stories. And here are three articles I found particularly interesting. Sam Coates in the Times (paywall) says Michael Gove, the justice secretary, is torn over what to do about the EU referendum. Michael Gove is fuelling hopes that he will back the campaign to leave the European Union by telling friends and colleagues of his deep discomfort at voting to remain. Downing Street sources had indicated that the justice secretary was likely to side with David Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor, by backing Britain to stay in the EU. Privately, however, Mr Gove claims to be torn between personal loyalty to the prime minister and his conscience. He is intellectually convinced of the case for leaving but worried about contributing to a campaign that would wreck Mr Cameronâ€™s legacy, friends said. His discomfort is said to be heightened by the prime ministerâ€™s demand that he presents plans for a court to defend Britain against new EU laws, which he believes to be unworkable. The plan for a constitutional court was seen as an attempt to secure support from Boris Johnson during the referendum campaign. The Daily Mail, in its front page â€˜Who will speak for England?â€\\x9d editorial (complaining that anti-EU ministers are refusing to speak out, and that the Out camp lacks effective leaders) criticises Boris Johnson. Donâ€™t bank on Boris Johnson either. True, the London mayor â€” never known for his courage â€” is happy to play flirtatious footsie with the â€˜outâ€™ campaign. But whatâ€™s the betting that at the first whiff of a plum Cabinet job, Boris will do the PMâ€™s bidding, keep his doubts to himself â€” and possibly even sign up to the â€˜remainâ€™ campaign? And the Sun in its editorial also has a go at Johnson. Boris Johnson would make an entertaining Prime Minister. Weâ€™re less convinced heâ€™d be good at it. His ducking and diving over the EU question, Britainâ€™s most significant in a generation, is not very encouraging. We have always admired Londonâ€™s Mayor for eloquently speaking his mind. But his many eurosceptic remarks are a deception. He has repeatedly talked up Britainâ€™s prospects outside the EU. And he plainly shares our scathing view of David Cameronâ€™s renegotiation. Yet he will not front the â€œLeaveâ€\\x9d campaign and be the powerful voice of millions who want out. Boris continues to flirt with it, but heâ€™ll vote to â€œRemainâ€\\x9d. Itâ€™s time he came off the fence. The FullFact blog points out, in the light of Alan Johnsonâ€™s interview, that it carried out its own fact check last year of the claim that in-work benefits were attracting EU migrants to the UK. It concluded that there was â€œno direct evidence on whether welfare has acted as a â€˜magnetâ€™ encouraging EU migrants to come to the UKâ€\\x9d. Sadiq Khan, Labourâ€™s candidate for London mayor, has unveiled a plan which he says would protect space for small businesses and start-ups in the capital. Itâ€™s part of his business framework, Sadiq Means Business. He released figures showing that, as a result of changes to planning rules introduced by the last government allowing commercial space to be turned into housing without planning permission, commercial floor space covering 1,786,466 sqm was lost in London between May 2013 and April 2015. He said that if all that space was fully occupied, it would have housed more than 123,000 jobs, although occupancy rates suggest 48,000 jobs have been lost or are under threat because of those changes. Khan said he would amend the London Plan to make it harder for these units to be converted into housing. In a statement he said: Of course we need new homes, but this does not need to be at the expense of the spaces we need for the businesses that provide our jobs and drive our prosperity. We should be focusing on building new homes on publicly and privately owned brownfield land, while using the London Plan to protect business space, and to create new start-up spaces in housing developments. Iâ€™ll make tackling the housing crisis my number one priority while increasing the space available for small business, start-ups and entrepreneurs. David Davis, the Conservative former Europe minister, and David Cameron main rival for the party leadership in 2005, will give a big speech on Europe later. It is being billed as his first in-depth contribution to the EU debate and he will use it to say that he is voting to leave the EU, to say that the EU is beyond reform, and to explain how Britain can eliminate the risks of Brexit. According to extracts sent out from his office in advance, he will also criticise David Cameronâ€™s â€œemergency brakeâ€\\x9d. Like Alan Johnson, he will argue that it will have no effect on immigration. Davis will say: The prime minister â€˜s emergency brake on migrant benefits would not stop a push bike. And we now discover we would have to ask Brusselsâ€™s permission to even use it. In any case, the whole concept of an emergency brake is flawed. Migrants are coming to Britain from Eastern Europe not to claim benefits but to earn more money. My figures show that they can readily earn three to four times as much working in low-skilled jobs in Britain. No amount of tinkering with our welfare rules will make a blind bit of difference to immigration numbers and the Prime Minister is being disingenuous to pretend otherwise. In a press notice, Davis explains why he believes cutting in-work benefits for EU migrants will not reduce migration. Davis will cite figures showing that the main attraction to would-be migrants from Eastern Europe is not Britainâ€™s welfare system but the vast disparity in earnings between the two parts of Europe. For instance, the monthly average wage in Romania (Â£400 a month) is currently less than one third of the monthly minimum wage in the UK (Â£1300). This gulf will widen to a factor of more than four (Â£400 to Â£1600) by 2020 when the new UK national living wage is introduced and gives a big boost to the earnings of unskilled workers. Davis will also point out that research shows that the vast majority of Eastern European migrants to the UK are either single or couples without children and that they make minimal demands on the UK welfare system. They are coming here for work, not handouts. Only 10 per cent claim in-work benefits in their first year in the UK, rising to 20 per cent after four years as they begin to form families and have children. Even so, 80 per cent are not claiming in work benefits after four years in Britain and therefore measures to curb benefit payments such as the emergency brake can be expected to have minimal effect on migrant inflows â€“ the publicâ€™s chief concern about the implications of EU membership. The press notice includes this chart showing the take up of tax credits by EEA (European Economic Area - which is the EU, plus three other small countries) citizens. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, was also on the Today programme, talking mostly about the Syria conference. But she was asked about David Cameronâ€™s EU renegotiation, and if she thought it was fair that he was able to promote it while anti-EU ministers will not be allowed to speak out until the deal has been formally agreed, in another two weeks ago. Unsurprisingly, she supported Cameron. I happen to agree with the prime minister, I think this is a good deal, I hope we can seal the deal when he goes to Brussels later this month. But in the meantime we have cabinet collective responsibility and indeed the deal isnâ€™t finally agreed yet. So I think we all need to back the Prime Minister to get the best deal for our country. Suzanne Evans, the Ukip deputy chair, thinks Alan Johnson was given an easy ride on Today. Several political parties will be involved in the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. There are at least three cross-party umbrella groups but Labour, mindful of how campaigning alongside the Conservatives in Better Together in Scotland backfired badly on the party at the 2015 general election, has got its own campaign, Labour In For Britain, and its chair, Alan Johnson, was on the Today programme this morning. Having multiple parties campaigning for the same thing can be an advantage, because they appeal to different groups. But it also has its drawbacks, because campaigners may contradict each other, and we saw that today when Johnson shot down one of David Cameronâ€™s key EU arguments. Here are the key points from the interview. Johnson said that cutting in-work benefits for EU migrants would not reduce immigration. Cameron has repeatedly argued that in-work benefits are one of the â€œpullâ€\\x9d factors that lure EU migrants to the UK (even though the evidence for this is minimal, to put it politely), and he has been talking up the significance of the â€œemergency brakeâ€\\x9d that would allow the UK to stop paying full in-work benefits to EU migrants for up to four years. But Johnson said this would have no impact on immigration. Asked if it would deter people from coming to the UK, he replied: It was never going to do that ... the issue of in-work benefits isnâ€™t a draw factor and indeed this is a two-way process, no country has more of its people working in other developed countries than Britain â€“ more than Poland, more than any other country in Europe. Go to a pub in Paris, go to a pub in Madrid you will hear English voices. Itâ€™s not a draw for them, either, thereâ€™s all kinds of factors why people choose to move around the European Union to work. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s one of them. But Johnson also said that Labour supported the principle behind the â€œemergency brakeâ€\\x9d on fairness grounds. He said: We believe in the principal of fair contribution, thatâ€™s why it was in our manifesto that there should be a limit of two years before in-work benefits were paid. Actually there is an argument that this is better in the sense that youâ€™re here contributing paying taxes for a period before you actually receive those benefits. And I think for British people the problem is not xenophobia, itâ€™s not anti-Europe, itâ€™s not any kind of racism overt or covert, itâ€™s a fairness argument. Itâ€™s that you should be putting something into the system before you draw anything out. He said that pro-Europeans had not been making the case for the EU strongly enough in recent years. I donâ€™t think many people, including me, have been making that argument sufficiently overt the last ten years. Now we can do it in areas where Ukip are strong and areas where they are not. There is more Europe coming later today. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The Supporting Syria conference opens in London. My colleague Matthew Weaver is covering that on a separate live blog. 11am: David Davis, the Conservative MP, gives a speech on what leaving the EU would mean for the UK. Around 12pm: MPs begin a debate on a backbench motion saying the EU renegotiation should protect parliamentary sovereignty. As usual, I will be covering breaking all the political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, Iâ€™m on@AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include â€œAndrewâ€\\x9d in it somewhere and Iâ€™m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or donâ€™t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.\",\n",
              "  'Trump aims to woo pro-Israel donors at Aipac despite their lingering worries As Donald Trump prepares to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the Republican presidential frontrunner is facing mounting criticism from pro-Israel leaders for his incendiary rhetoric and policy stances. Meanwhile, after months bashing other candidates for their links to big donors, Trump appears to be making inroads wooing some staunchly pro-Israel megadonors, including billionaire Sheldon Adelson â€“ though other big check-writers still have huge concerns about his candidacy. Despite awards Trump has received from pro-Israel groups and his boast that he would â€œdo more for Israel than anyone elseâ€\\x9d, many Jewish leaders both conservative and liberal have found much to criticize about Trump. The anti-Trump sentiments have targeted his numerous comments on the campaign trail that are perceived as anti-immigrant, anti-women and anti-Muslim, raising the stakes for the real estate billionaire in his Aipac speech on Monday evening. â€œAnybody who is lauded by David Duke, Vladimir Putin and Jean-Marie Le Pen, I canâ€™t support,â€\\x9d said former US senator Norm Coleman, a board member of the conservative pro-Israel Republican Jewish Coalition, of which Adelson is the lead funder. â€œTheyâ€™re listening to his dog whistles and responding favorably, which frightens me.â€\\x9d Colemanâ€™s critique of Trump is only one of many from Jewish conservatives, religious leaders and some donors. Pre-Aipac political fireworks began last week when a few dozen rabbis announced they intended to boycott Trumpâ€™s speech because of moral concerns about his inflammatory comments about Mexicans, Muslims and other issues. â€œWe object to Trumpâ€™s message,â€\\x9d said Jeff Salkin, a rabbi and Aipac member from Hollywood, Florida, and one of the boycott organizers. â€œItâ€™s a message of division, bigotry and xenophobia. Heâ€™s threatened violence against protesters. This is about who and what we want America to be.â€\\x9d Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator with the US State Department and now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center thinktank, said: â€œIn my experience dealing with the pro-Israel community in the US, there has never been a presidential candidate or a politician speaking at Aipac who has been more a source of division and fundamental opposition than Donald Trump.â€\\x9d Trump sparked other concerns among conservative Jewish groups and donors late last year when he talked to a candidate forum organized by the hawkish Republican Jewish Coalition. In his remarks, Trump spoke of his desire if elected to be a â€œneutralâ€\\x9d player in fostering peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. â€œWe donâ€™t want to be even-handed,â€\\x9d one RJC board member told the about Trumpâ€™s idea of being a neutral peace negotiator. Trump has won plaudits in some conservative pro-Israel quarters for attacking President Obama and the secretary of state, John Kerry, for â€œselling out Israelâ€\\x9d and lambasting the Iran nuclear deal as a â€œdisasterâ€\\x9d for Israel. The Republican frontrunner has also touted his past support for Israel. When he received an award early last year from a Jewish news organization, Trump said: â€œWe love Israel. We will fight for Israel 100%. We will fight for Israel 1,000%.â€\\x9d (Trump also often cites his role as grand marshal of the Israel parade in New York in 2004, and notes that one of his daughters is married to an orthodox Jew and that she converted as well.) But to bolster his credentials, the Trump speech on Monday is expected by analysts and donors to be staunchly pro-Israel. It is also seen as a chance to burnish his image for Adelson and other major Jewish donors. To build bridges to conservative allies and donors before his speech, the Trump campaign reportedly contacted some prominent GOP fundraisers for help in crafting his remarks. To expand his Washington support, Trump was meeting before his speech with a couple of dozen lawmakers and lobbyists, a gathering that is slated to include Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an early Trump backer, and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a prominent Middle East hawk. Despite his harsh words for big donors on the campaign trail, Trump has been quietly wooing several megadonors including Adelson, who is a famously ardent supporter of Israel and confidant of the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. At a candidate debate in December held at an Adelson casino resort in Las Vegas, Trump had a private meeting with Adelson, who had warm words for his fellow billionaire. At a press conference a few days later in Macau, where he owns major casinos, Adelson called Trump â€œvery charmingâ€\\x9d and said they spoke about Israel. Adelson donated close to $150m in 2012 to a mix of Super Pacs, which must reveal their donors, and not-for-profit organizations, which donâ€™t have to disclose contributors, to help Republicans. But other leading pro-Israel donors such as hedge fund chief Paul Singer still seem to have grave doubts about Trump. Singer, who donated $5m to a Super Pac backing Marco Rubio, has also been $1m donor to Our Principles Pac, which has run millions of dollars of anti-Trump ads in several states. Our Principles is running ads in Utah before Tuesdayâ€™s caucus and will have spots up in Wisconsin before its primary next month to undercut Trumpâ€™s ability to get enough delegates to secure the nomination before the GOP convention this summer.

              "  'Malcolm Turnbull warns marginal seat voters against supporting independents Malcolm Turnbull appealed directly to marginal seat voters in a campaign launch speech that urged Australians to resist the â€œroll of the dice on independents or minor partiesâ€\\x9d and return the Coalition government to ensure stability. â€œThat is why I counsel Australians against a roll of the dice on independents or minor parties,â€\\x9d Turnbull said. â€œVote for anyone other than the Liberal and National party candidates, and the risk is that Australians will next week find themselves with Bill Shorten as prime minister and no certainty about their future. â€œThat is why I am urging every Australian to think of this election as if their single vote will determine what sort of government we have after July 2.â€\\x9d In the final weekend of an eight-week election marathon, the prime minister â€œlaunchedâ€\\x9d the campaign in the seat of Reid, held by Liberal MP Craig Laundy on a margin of 3.3%. Turnbullâ€™s key messages were stability following the UKâ€™s decision to exit the European Union and a return to Tony Abbottâ€™s theme of a safe, secure Australia. â€œNational security and economic security go hand in hand,â€\\x9d he said. Turnbull nuanced the Coalitionâ€™s domestic message in the wake of the Brexit decision, with a nod to the disengagement felt by voters in Australia and around the world. â€œThere has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian,â€\\x9d Turnbull said. â€œBut only if your optimism and confidence is matched with a clear-eyed understanding of what makes the economy work, what makes businesses invest and hire, and an ability to see the world as it is, not how you would like it to be. â€œThis is a time which demands stable majority government.â€\\x9d His Coalition partner, the National party, has been worried throughout the campaign that Turnbullâ€™s message of â€œexciting timesâ€\\x9d in a changing economy has been scaring the electorate, especially in regional Australia. The prime minister, whose main policy is a $50bn corporate tax cut, underlined the connection between the economy and people, fleshing out specific examples including women who want more part-time work and young people who want to get a start. â€œWe know that the economy is people â€“ their lives, their futures, their security.â€\\x9d He characterised the $50bn decision to build submarines in South Australia as a â€œhistoric investmentâ€\\x9d because â€œonly a strong Australia can be a safe Australiaâ€\\x9d. He attacked Laborâ€™s record on asylum seekers â€“ â€œ50,000 unauthorised arrivals on 800 boats, 1,200 deaths at seaâ€\\x9d â€“ and again suggested people smugglers were looking for a sign that the government would waver on refugee policy. Turnbull warned the division in Labor over boats policy would mean the return of asylum seeker boats. â€œWe know this because hope rarely triumphs over experience,â€\\x9d Turnbull said. â€œThey have failed Australia before.â€\\x9d He borrowed from John Howardâ€™s justification for hardline asylum policy. â€œPublic trust in the government to determine who can come to Australia and how long they can stay is an essential foundation of our success as a multicultural society,â€\\x9d Turnbull said. Turnbull thanked Howard for his reforms, which he said â€œset Australia up for the longest period of prosperity in our historyâ€\\x9d, and Tony Abbott for ending the Rudd-Gillard years. â€œJohn and Tony, we salute you.â€\\x9d Turnbull announced a number of election pledges in the final stage of the campaign, with the major commitment around mental health. He promised $192m towards a package of mental health changes to ensure help for individuals and their families, including commitments in suicide prevention, which has been a persistent theme in the campaign. The Coalition pledged $48m to help 24,000 of Australiaâ€™s most disadvantaged children with their education through the Smith Familyâ€™s Learning for Life program and $31.2m for internships and post-school career advice to increase support for women and girls to study and work in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). There is $50m to improve the digital literacy of senior Australians and $10m to protect, preserve and celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait languages as part of the living story of Australiaâ€™s shared history. He attacked Bill Shortenâ€™s policies as being a recipe for â€œeconomic stagnationâ€\\x9d, characterised by â€œunion thuggeryâ€\\x9d and raised the Victorian firefightersâ€™ dispute. â€œHis vision splendid is to run the nation like a trade union,â€\\x9d Turnbull said. â€œThe volunteer firefighters of Victoria know what that looks like.â€\\x9d In a bid to sidetrack the Coalition event, Shorten effectively held a second campaign launch in Brisbane under the guise of a Save Medicare rally. He framed the Coalition as divided and Malcolm Turnbull as a weak leader ahead of the Liberal launch. â€œBehind the forced smiles today and the awkward music, when we watch them, those Liberals at that party are sharpening their weapons of revenge for the impending civil war in that party after the election.â€\\x9d The latest poll from Galaxy Research â€“ of more than 500 voters in each seat â€“ showed Labor was unlikely to win the marginal seats required to take government. The poll, published in News Corp papers, found Labor would win only two of 14 Coalition-held marginal seats in four states and is at 50-50 in two others. The poll suggests Labor could win the Queensland seats of Petrie (2PP 52-48) and Capricornia (2PP 51-49) while it is on 50-50 in Hindmarsh in South Australia and Macarthur in New South Wales.',\n",
              "  'Noel Gallagher: We should never have made Be Here Now then Oasis should never have made Be Here Now when they did, according to Noel Gallagher. Despite being bullish around the time of its release, the Oasis songwriter now claims that the bandâ€™s overblown 1997 album was recorded too soon after their hugely successful second LP Whatâ€™s the Story (Morning Glory)? During a video interview with Vevo, Gallagher said: â€œI only say this now, looking back on it after 20 years â€¦ we should never have made that record then. We came off the back of that American tour which was, again, the third tour in a row that we never completed. And I came back to the airport and the fucking worldâ€™s press was there and instead of going, â€˜Right, we should just go our separate ways for a year or two,â€™ we decided like idiots to go straight into the studio.â€\\x9d He added: â€œThat maybe wasnâ€™t the best idea. Morning Glory hadnâ€™t really run its course then. It was probably still number one in England, it was definitely still top five in the States. And yet, there we were, going into the studio, effectively trying to make another album to kill it, which was ridiculous.â€\\x9d Gallagher also claimed that the band should have been talked out of making the record when they did. He said: â€œI often think, looking back, the people around us who were in the music business for 20 years before we got there should really have said something.â€\\x9d Be Here Now received rave reviews at the time of its release, and saw fans queuing outside record shops to buy it.

              "  'U-turns are possible on the road to hard Brexit Jonathan Freedland is right that the referendum result has to be honoured (Who speaks for the 48% as we lurch to extreme Brexit?, 8 October). That does not mean, however, that it is sacrosanct, any more than the result of a general election. Those who argue that it is undemocratic to seek its reversal if circumstances have changed ignore the fact that it is an essential part of democracy that no decision should ever be irreversible. As Freedland states, leavers did not vote for the most extreme rupture of our relations with the EU that will cause profound damage to our economy. But we are now heading inexorably towards a hard Brexit, since the government has made immigration control of our borders its top priority, which is incompatible with staying in the single market or the customs union. When this realisation sinks in â€“ the decline in the value of the pound shows it is already happening â€“ domestic and foreign investment will decline, a flood of companies will emigrate, London will probably cease to be the financial centre of the EU and we are likely to face a severe, self-inflicted Brexit recession. In time that is likely to cause a major change in public opinion, as many voters for leave will feel they were conned. This change will fully justify a rerun of the referendum, after the conclusion of the negotiations, before our departure becomes inevitable. It is widely assumed that once we trigger article 50 and announce our intention to leave, this sets in motion an irreversible process. However, this assumption does not appear to be legally correct. In an article for the Financial Times, Jean-Claude Piris, former director general of the legal service of the Council of the European Union, has pointed out that invoking article 50 and declaring â€œan intentionâ€\\x9d to leave is a â€œunilateral act that does not depend on what other members think or doâ€\\x9d and that â€œIn law, the word â€˜intentionâ€™ cannot be interpreted as a final and irreversible decisionâ€\\x9d. Nothing in article 50, he wrote, would prevent the UK, in conformity with its constitutional requirements, from withdrawing its unilaterally declared â€œintentionâ€\\x9d. Those who voted remain are therefore perfectly entitled, legally and democratically, to do everything possible to avoid a disastrous future for this country. Indeed some of us regard this as our duty. Dick Taverne Liberal Democrat, House of Lords â€¢ One of the most worrying aspects of the Brexit debate is theconstant attempts by the Brexiteers to deny the legitimacy of debate following the referendum: â€œthe people have spokenâ€\\x9d is their sole refrain whenever a contrary voice is heard. Yet scrutiny, challenge and debate are not optional extras in a democracy, they are the very essence. It is beyond ironic that those who argued so vehemently for parliamentary sovereignty should resort to the royal prerogative and so deny the very democracy they claim to have fought for. Roy Boffy Sutton Coldfield â€¢ Just suppose that the referendum had produced exactly the opposite result, with just over half of those who voted choosing to stay in the EU. Would the government have been entitled to go for hard remain and join the euro and sign up for the Schengen agreement? And, if so, would the leavers have accepted that the British people had made their decision and there was nothing more to be said? Kath Aspinwall Hathersage, Derbyshire â€¢ The prime minister (May quick to reject cross-party calls for Commons vote on the single market, 10 October) believes that the government can proceed with Brexit under the royal prerogative without the authority of parliament. Brexit will inevitably involve the repeal of the European Communities Act. Only parliament can repeal an act of parliament. Any other view would be a constitutional nonsense. The prime minister might do well to recall that over 300 years ago we fought a civil war on the issue of parliamentary sovereignty, and at least one monarch lost his head as a consequence. Derek Gambell Bromley, Kent â€¢ Your coverage of Theresa Mayâ€™s conference speech (â€˜Change must comeâ€™: May consigns Cameron to history, 6 October) omitted one of the most intriguing remarks that she made: that â€œit is time to reject the ideological templates provided by the socialist left and the libertarian rightâ€\\x9d. The libertarian right, unlike the socialist left, is strongly entrenched within Mrs Mayâ€™s own party. Its disciples include Liam Fox and David Davis, as well as Nigel Lawson, who tells us that Brexit offers the chance to complete his interpretation of the Thatcher revolution, by shrinking taxation, regulation and the state as a whole. The Taxpayersâ€™ Alliance, with its close links to the Republican right in Washington and the leadership of the leave campaign, propounds libertarian doctrines; so does the Institute of Economic Affairs. Both are regularly and admiringly quoted in the rightwing press. If our new prime minister really intends to take on the ideologues within her own party, then it will not only be the Labour party which will be faction-ridden over the next few years. Of course, she may back down before their passionate pressure; but if so, the social and industrial agenda that she has just set out will be a shell. Those of us on the centre left, from Liberal Democrats to Labour social democrats, should exert as much passionate pressure on the prime minister from the other side not to slip away from the promises she has just made in order to hold her divided party together.

              "  'The 50 best films of 2016 in the US: No 2 Toni Erdmann Few people settle in for a three-hour German comedy about an uptight woman and her farty father expecting a masterpiece. Yet thatâ€™s what Maren Adeâ€™s extraordinary, genre-bending revolution of a movie is. It tells of Ines (Sandra HÃ¼ller), an efficient, humourless, whippet-thin businesswoman in her mid-30s. Sheâ€™s focused on success with no apparent aim but for its own sake (â€œYouâ€™re an animal,â€\\x9d someone tells her â€“ there are a lot beasties in this film). To this end, she sacrifices her free time, much of her social life, and many of her ethics. Thereâ€™s one appalling scene in which she must take shopping the wife of a powerful contact sheâ€™s courting. â€œIâ€™m not a feminist,â€\\x9d she witheringly tells one of the colleagues above whom she is miles more capable and bright, â€œor I wouldnâ€™t tolerate guys like you.â€\\x9d We pity brittle Ines. We donâ€™t necessarily like her. Following the death of his dog, her prank-loving dad, Winfried (Peter Simonichek), decides to pay her a visit for the weekend. This goes appallingly; the endless wait for the lift down from her apartment to the cab is a perfect horror-show of two people with deep affection who canâ€™t stand the sight one another. But Winfried, concerned for Inesâ€™s sanity, does not actually leave. Rather, he shows up again, infiltrating her sacred professional circle, beneath weird wig and ill-fitting false teeth, calling himself a life coach called Toni Erdmann. Similarities to Les Patterson are accidental â€“ but irresistible. Toni also bears a striking resemblance to Harold Bornstein, aka Donald Trumpâ€™s trusted doctor (on the left in this Twitter comparison). The remainder of the film is essentially a compendium of showcase scenes which you canâ€™t shift, even months on. Thereâ€™s an Easter egg painting party which culminates in an angry, flabbergasting rendition of Whitney Houstonâ€™s The Greatest Love of All (which had the Cannes press audience erupting in spontaneous, mid-screening applause). Thereâ€™s the naked birthday bash. The sex scene involving petits fours. The shockingly moving playground chase involving a Kukeri (like an elephant, theyâ€™re hard to describe, but you know one once youâ€™ve seen one). Adeâ€™s film, highly scripted but culled from hundreds of hours of footage, is like nothing youâ€™ve ever seen before. It tickles, frequently, but it also touches you more deeply than you could have anticipated. It is an extravagant film about loneliness and DNA, its web of emotional hostage-taking too complex to ever begin to unpick.',\n",
              "  \"A&E units are overwhelmed, and it's not the fault of staff Accident and emergency services are the national symbol of the NHS. While people may have complaints and grumbles about treatment elsewhere in the health service, it is an article of faith that when you have an emergency you will see the NHS at its best. More than this, it exemplifies the principle of free at the point of need. Extraordinary human and technical resources can be mobilised in minutes to save your life, irrespective of your wealth and status, or the cost to the state. But increasingly A&E is also coming to symbolise a health service struggling to cope, with multiplying pressures and no sign of a long-term solution. Between 2003-04 and 2014-15, according to Kingâ€™s Fund analysis, annual A&E attendances jumped from around 16 million to more than 22 million. For most of this time, the majority of the increase went to walk-in centres and minor injuries units. But more recently there have been significant rises in the number of people attending major A&E units, which is having a big impact on hospitalsâ€™ ability to cope. In the eyes of politicians and the media, A&E performance has been reduced to whether it is able to hit the government target of 95% of patients being seen, treated, admitted or discharged in under four hours. Performance has been worsening steadily since 2010, and in 2014-15, the 95% standard was missed for the year. But the causes are complicated. Analysis by regulator Monitor of the steep decline in performance over the winter of 2014-15 reveals hospitals have been struggling to cope with a significant rise in the number of people arriving by ambulance. This can be seen in a sharp increase in delays for ambulance crews handing over patients and the average waiting time for an initial assessment creeping up. The biggest problem tends to be delays in admitting patients from A&E to the hospital. The average wait for admission in the three months up to December jumped in a year from under four hours to almost four-and-a-half . The most striking conclusion reached by Monitor is the sharp performance drop last winter against the four-hour target was not due to a drop in the performance of A&E units themselves. In other words, the staff are working as well as ever, but they are gradually being overwhelmed by factors beyond their control. If anything, A&E departments were using their capacity more effectively to manage the increased demand, and overall staffing levels for both doctors and nurses were slightly higher. Too often, hospital bed occupancy rates are pushing over 90% â€“ well past the 85% threshold at which NHS England suggest hospitals will struggle with fluctuations in demand. At this sort of level, further small increases in bed occupancy can significantly impair A&E performance. Other studies have indicated that improving the flow of patients through care pathways and ensuring patients are cared for in the most appropriate setting are the best ways to get bed occupancy rates down, and improve the flow of patients from A&E to wards. This highlights the importance of factors such as timely access to testing and results, and hospitalsâ€™ own discharge systems working well. Difficulties elsewhere in the system, such as accessing GP services out of hours and discharging patients from hospitals to social care play a part. The impact of social care cuts may well exacerbate problems this winter, but it is hard to pin down exactly how much these factors hit A&E. However, the revelation by Health Service Journal that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence believes A&E departments need to build a greater margin of safety into their nurse staffing levels shows there is more to analysing performance than using a stopwatch. Morale, the willingness of clinicians to embark on a career in emergency care and whether talented staff are prepared to stay are also critical factors. While relentless firefighting is to some extent the nature of emergency medicine, there is a fine line between adrenaline and burnout. The fact that the huge pressures on staff are not yet affecting overall performance is testimony to their extraordinary efforts, but the crunch point will come unless there is action to relieve the unsustainable load.

              "  'Tottenham steamroller lacklustre Stoke with Son Heung-min double Mark Hughes told Tottenham Hotspur fans to shut up, but his team could not silence the visiting forwards. Son Heung-min scored twice before Dele Alli and Harry Kane struck their first goals of the campaign and, in doing so, confirmed that Tottenham are up and running for the new season after playing fitfully in their first three matches. Hughes, meanwhile, may have disciplinary matters to fret about in addition to his teamâ€™s botched start to the season after being sent to the stands in the first half. Stoke are bottom of the league with one point from four matches. Tottenham took the lead thanks to their ability to keep calm in the storm caused in part by Stokeâ€™s fury with the referee, Anthony Taylor, and the fourth official, Jon Moss. Taylor, acting on advice from Moss, ordered Hughes to vacate the sideline in the 34th minute after the manager stomped out of his technical area to vent his anger at the booking of Marko Arnautovic for simulation. Hughes felt that Stoke should have been given a free-kick before that for a foul on Jonathan Walters and was doubly aggrieved when Taylor judged Arnautovicâ€™s â€œevasive actionâ€\\x9d to be a dive. â€œThose were two decisions I felt should have gone our way so I reacted in a forceful manner,â€\\x9d Hughes said. â€œSometimes you forget that this year youâ€™re not allowed to come out of your technical area. Mr Moss, bless him, felt that warranted a sending off, which, by the letter of the law, it did, so I have to hold my hands up. But I saw Sky say that maybe I swore, which I didnâ€™t.â€\\x9d As he left the pitch Hughes made gestures to rev up the home crowd. Then he tried to send a different message to away supporters. â€œI was telling them to shut up,â€\\x9d he said. â€œSorry if I did that.â€\\x9d That hoopla created a sizzling atmosphere in which players needed to stay cool. Spurs did so better and were rewarded by Sonâ€™s goal in the 41st minute. Joe Allen might have thwarted it if he had not overcommitted when trying to dispossess Christian Eriksen, allowing the Dane to sidestep him before pulling the ball back from the sideline to Son, who was unmarked 12 yards from goal. The South Korean guided it first time into the net with his left foot. Such composure in the bedlam can only have encouraged Mauricio Pochettino, bearing in mind how his team lost their heads and the league title at Stamford Bridge last season. Earlier, Spurs had to show resilience to weather a storm of another kind, as Stoke started strongly. Wilfried Bony, making his debut for the hosts after joining on loan from Manchester City, gave the team a much-needed fulcrum up front. The Ivorian threatened as early as the second minute when he exchanged passes with Walters before unleashing a 16-yard shot that was blocked by Jan Vertonghen. Glenn Whelan and Ryan Shawcross also had efforts foiled by defenders. Tottenham gradually took the upperhand, however, thanks to the crispness and swiftness of their passing. Son served notice of his menace by collecting a crossfield pass from Toby Alderweireld on the half-hour and dashing towards the Stoke area. Arnautovic chased back to disrupt his progress but inadvertently played the ball into the path of Alli. He dragged a shot past the advancing Shay Given but wide of the post. Then, following Hughesâ€™s expulsion, Son shot Spurs in front. Half-time brought a chance to regroup and Stoke did hint at a comeback early in the second half. But Son quashed it with a superb strike on the counterattack, collecting another pass from Eriksen at the corner of the area and sweeping a first-time shot in at the far post. Stoke began to unravel. â€œThe second goal deflated us more markedly than it should have,â€\\x9d Hughes said. Spurs were not minded to show mercy. The visitors inflicted further damage through another rapid counterattack on the hour. Kyle Walker hurtled down the right and picked out Alli, who, like Son for the first goal, had found space in the middle of the area and took full advantage. With Victor Wanyama on a yellow card and guilty of a couple of tackles that the home crowd believed should have resulted in a red, Pochettino made a substitution to ensure Tottenham kept 11 players on the pitch, replacing Wanyama with Ã‰rik Lamela. â€œIt was better to take the pressure off the referee and Victor,â€\\x9d said Pochettino. All that was missing from Spursâ€™ point of view was a goal for Harry Kane. So Son helped deliver one. He tricked his way down the left before providing a pass that enabled Kane to end the wait for his first goal of the campaign.',\n",
              "  'Brexiters maintain stubborn mood in face of chilling EU warnings The Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico is set in postwar London with austerity at its height. Inhabitants find that they can escape rationing because the district was once part of Burgundy during a conflict that has never formally ended. They set up their own kingdom within a kingdom, defiantly resisting attempts by Westminster to bludgeon them back into line. The mood of stubborn resistance is summed up by one of the characters whose Englishness is called into question. â€œWe always were English and we always will be English and itâ€™s because we are English that we are sticking up for our right to be Burgundian.â€\\x9d Something of this mood has pervaded the EU referendum debate, so far at least. Warnings about the dire consequences of a vote to leave have come in thick and fast. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said Brexit would be the equivalent of a tax increase, the Bank of England said it might tip the economy into a technical recession and the International Monetary Fund said Britons should brace themselves for a stock market crash and plunging house prices. Appearing on The Andrew Marr Show, the pro-Brexit energy minister Andrea Leadsom described it as â€œinstitutional ganging up on the poor British voterâ€\\x9d. One of the leaders of the gang, Mark Carney, was also interviewed on the BBC programme. The Bank of England governor was unrepentant about his public warning last week that the higher inflation and slower growth Threadneedle Street thinks would result from a Brexit vote might be enough to tip the economy into recession. Whatâ€™s interesting about the campaign so far is that the bloodcurdling warnings about the horrors that will be visited on the economy in the event of Brexit seem to have had such little effect. The remain camp think the intervention of Carney will prove decisive in swaying undecided voters, and some on the leave side privately agree. It is possible that the polls are understating support for the status quo, which will only become apparent in the last few weeks before the 23 June vote, when people really start to concentrate on how they will vote. But so far, the Brexit camp must be pretty pleased with how things are going. The bloody-minded spirit of Passport to Pimlico lives on. There are umpteen possible explanations for that. It could be the heavy-handed way the government has gone about things, which has allowed the leavers to portray themselves â€“ in true Ealing comedy fashion â€“ as underdogs. As one small example, the IMFâ€™s annual health check on the UK economy was delayed last year because it did not want to be dragged into politics at the time of the general election. Those niceties have been cast aside this year, with the fundâ€™s report used as a campaigning weapon by George Osborne. The initial findings of the IMF team sent to the UK were published last Friday: the full report will appear the week before the referendum. The remain camp also needs to be careful not to overstate its case. There would undoubtedly be a great deal of uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of a vote to leave. Sterling would take a hit and dearer exports would push up inflation. A slowdown in the economy has been under way for several quarters and was happening long before the prospect of Brexit surfaced. It is not outlandish of the Bank of England to float the idea that the economy could slide into technical recession given that growth was 0.4% in the first three months of 2016 and a further slowdown looks highly probable in the second quarter as investment is delayed in the run-up to the 23 June vote. There would then be a further hit to activity after a Brexit vote. Clearly, two quarters of negative growth â€“ the definition of a recession â€“ cannot be ruled out. But the sky would not fall in. Britain would remain a member of the EU for at least two years after a no vote and the full weight of the UK political establishment would instantly switch from warning about the dire perils of Brexit to ensuring that the costs of divorce would be minimised. There is no certainty that Christine Lagardeâ€™s prediction of a crash in house prices would come true and it would be a net benefit to the economy if it did. Likewise a fall in the value of the pound, which would do something to help rebalance the economy by making exports cheaper. Conversely, a remain vote is likely to lead to a stronger pound, making the imbalances worse. Both the Bank and the IMF assume that the economy is in pretty good shape and will bounce back quickly once the threat of Brexit is removed. But as the IMF noted in its Article IV report, the underlying problems of the economy â€“ the low level of household savings, an abysmally poor productivity performance and a terrifyingly large current account deficit â€“ have actually got worse in the past year. The Bankâ€™s growth forecasts, which assume that the UK will stay in the EU, have been cut since February as a result of the continuing weakness of productivity. The underlying problems of the economy are the result of decades of under-investment in the economyâ€™s productive base, not the Brexit threat. It is therefore open to the remain side to make the case that leaving the EU is a shock the UK could do without at a time when the economy is not in the greatest shape. This has the virtue of being true and might impress voters put off by hyperbolic claims that Britain risks becoming an economic wasteland within weeks of 23 June. Yet, it doesnâ€™t suit Osborneâ€™s narrative, which is that the economy has flourished under his stewardship these past six years and that Britain will be a land overflowing with milk and honey once the threat of Brexit has been banished. Instead, he will crank up the volume still higher over the next few weeks, confident that the tactic that has been so successful in swaying floating voters in general elections â€“ Labour is bad for your wealth â€“ will work just as well in the referendum. But maybe it wonâ€™t. Veteran economics commentator Brian Reading made the point last week that the 13 American colonies were fully aware of the consequences for trade and capital flows from Britain if they chose independence. Noting that George Washington et al preferred making their own laws rather than having them made in London, Reading said: â€œNo one today would argue that the American states would have been better off remaining UK colonies.â€\\x9d Is Britain gearing up for a 1776 moment? It seems improbable. In Passport to Pimlico, remember, the film ends with the status quo restored. But polls suggest many voters are looking beyond Carneyâ€™s â€œtechnical recessionâ€\\x9d. And thatâ€™s making the remain camp very nervous.',\n",

In April 2014, I was shocked to learn that Scotlandâ€™s only proper rock radio station had been replaced by something vapid and inane called X-FM. I wrote then: â€œHeavy rock is important to society as it portrays and recalls our industrial heritage and celebrates hard work, honesty and integrity. If there was ever a proper revolution in this country it would provide the soundtrack to the social upheaval; not Franz Ferdinand or the Smiths or Blur.â€\\x9d It seems our campaign has paid off. For it was announced last month that Ofcom had awarded Rock Radio Glasgow the FM commercial radio licence in the west central Scotland area. It was the culmination of a campaign that, I think, stands within the finest traditions of the â€™s brave and counterintuitive reporting. Donald MacLeod, who owns the Cathouse and Garage nightclubs, is chair of Rock Radio. He is a chap not unknown to the in Scotland as he has often offered us sanctuary in one of his meaty establishments when many others had previously refused. MacLeod was effusive in his appreciation of the for its support. â€œIf it hadnâ€™t been for the unstinting support of the , Iâ€™m not sure we would have got over the finishing line. As Jimmy Page and Robert Plant once wrote: â€˜And itâ€™s whispered that soon, if we all call the tune, then the piper will lead us to reasonâ€™.â€\\x9d Scotland has been buffeted recently by fell forces that still threaten its economic and social wellbeing. The independence referendum was lost in a welter of falsehoods and half-truths whereby Labour in Scotland and their allies in the Tory party conned the frail and the elderly into maintaining the status quo. Since then weâ€™ve had Brexit, the rise of the hard right, ultra-austerity, racial aggravation and the bitter knowledge that Donald Trump is Scottish. Yet there are signs that the nation is experiencing a degree of solace in a rockâ€™nâ€™roll renaissance. The news that Rock Radio now possesses the new FM licence in the west of Scotland doesnâ€™t just mean a return to Led Zep, Deep Purple, Van Halen, Mountain and Judas Priest and an escape from Adele, Justin Bieber and Rhianna. It will also provide training and support for indigenous bands who acknowledge that God has indeed given rockâ€™nâ€™roll to us, to paraphrase those great lyricists Simmons and Stanley. This year also marked the 10th annual Bonfest in Kirriemuir, held to celebrate the life and career of Bon Scott, celebrated frontman of AC/DC, who was raised in this douce little Angus town. Previously, Kirriemuir was known only as the birthplace of JM Barrie. Now, thanks to Bonfest, itâ€™s been revealed that for the first time more people were inspired to visit Kirriemuir because of its Bon Scott connection than its JM Barrie one. And letâ€™s face it, what would you rather your town was renowned for: fairies or rockâ€™nâ€™roll damnation? Next yearâ€™s Bonfest will be held in April and, while Scotland has far too many arts and cultural festivals, this one shouldnâ€™t be missed. The majority of festivals are principally for a wandering troupe of second-rate authors, singers and artists who canâ€™t make money on their own but can live off the fees guaranteed by gullible local councils that think theyâ€™re funding something cultural and essential. Inexplicably, Glasgow, which has a rich rockâ€™nâ€™roll heritage, has opted to turn up its nose at the chance to market itself as one of the worldâ€™s top destinations for the head-banging oeuvre. Although Bon Scott was the braggartly leader of AC/DC, the band were founded by the Glaswegian brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, who were born within sight of the water tower at Cranhill in the East End of Glasgow. Yet, despite the efforts of councillor Frank Docherty, the ruling Labour group decided against awarding these two the freedom of the city. The party was probably too busy doing what it does best: making twinning arrangements with enough cities to keep its councillors in jollies for a lifetime. If Labour wants to have a chance of holding off the SNPâ€™s assault on its local authority powerbase in Glasgow, it needs to get with the rockâ€™nâ€™roll picture. If the SNP get in theyâ€™ll probably ban all rockâ€™nâ€™roll because the lyrics are not sufficiently diverse and fail to deliver the appropriate pattern of deliverable outcomes on gender issues and responsible attitudes towards alcohol and relationships. So hereâ€™s my plan to help Labour stave off the threat of the Nationalist roundheads. They need to announce a Rockfest week along the lines of Kirriemuirâ€™s Bonfest. This would celebrate the genius of the Young brothers and others such as Brian Robertson, the great Thin Lizzy lead guitarist, Alex Harvey, Jimmy Barnes, Bobby Gillespie and Jim Kerr. In their seminal work, Sin City, a thoughtful Ã©tude on loss and redemption in an urban setting, Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott included these lines: So spin that wheel, cut that pack And roll those loaded dice Bring on the dancing girls And put the champagne on ice Iâ€™m goinâ€™ in To Sin City',\n",
              "  'Financial watchdogs need more bite to bring shadow banking to heel Behind the easy-going manner, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is angry. The object of his anger is Sir John Vickers, the mild-mannered former deputy governor who keeps telling the world that Carney has gone soft on the bankers. In recent months, when he hasnâ€™t been discussing the impact of the EU referendum, Carney has behaved as if he were a Plantagenet king, dispatching his lieutenants to crush a former friend turned critic. The most recent intervention was led by Martin Taylor, a Barclays chief in the 1990s who sits with Carney on the financial policy committee, the UKâ€™s financial watchdog. Taylorâ€™s defence of the FPC was cleverly couched not only as a rebuke to those who believe that it is weak, but also to those who consider regulation too tight, positioning the watchdog as even-handed â€“ tough on banking, without crushing the industry under a welter of heavy-handed rules. Why must Vickers be intellectually assassinated? The answer is in the credit bubble that is growing by the week. The Bank is concerned that it will be undermined as chief regulator if critics can convince the public and parliament its policies have been watered down and rules that remain made so complex they can be gamed by the finance industry to a point where they are worthless in the event of a crash. Carney and the FPC are right to be worried. Vickers and others paint a scary picture of an industry where the culture has changed little and the next financial crisis is just around the corner. Not only did Vickers say bank lending should be capped at 25 times capital, only to be told the chancellor would tolerate 33 times, his plans for ringfencing (to keep a bankâ€™s retail operations separate from casino-style investment banking) were watered down. Vickers wanted the kind of simple ringfence an interested citizen might be able to understand. Instead, he got a complex web of capital ratios and inter-relationships that few but the geekiest bank experts can fathom. Bank chiefs are playing their old tunes. HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver said last year he would both cut the bankâ€™s riskiest assets and achieve double-digit returns. It showed he believes the pre-crash era of super-returns is close at hand now the regulator is subdued. Such is the huge volume of capital swimming around the global financial system that investors have for some time been spreading their bets, and this is where Carneyâ€™s critics get really worried. Part of the reason Gulliver is under pressure to promise super-returns is that investors are diverting a large portion of their savings to sponsor a huge rise in shadow banking, which is the term for generally opaque lending by non-bank financial firms. There are bigger returns to be made than even bank bosses promise in their more exuberant statements. Already car loans in the US are looking like they are the new sub-prime lending scandal. Mortgage lending in the UK is heading the same way after reaching pre-crisis levels. Too often mortgages are sold to over-eager first-time buyers at astronomical income multiples. And thatâ€™s the high-street banks at work. Carney, who is also chair of G20-sponsored global regulator the Financial Stability Board, says the bank is on the case. According to the FSB, a narrow definition of shadow banking shows it grew to $36 trillion, or 12% of financial system assets, in 2014. A wider aggregate figure for all shadow-banking activities, including pension funds and insurers who lend out their securities, hit $137tn, representing 40% of total financial system assets. Last month, Carney issued the FSBâ€™s latest review and urged countries to pay attention to the risks. But there is little public data on the scale of the risks taken by shadow banks and very little regulation. A report by the University of Leeds and the University of the Basque Country shows that business school economists from across Europe are worried. They believe the culture of banks has changed little since the crash and governments are still in thrall to their financial sectors as cash generators, ignoring the risks they pose to their economies and social structures. More than 90% of the 50 experts polled for the EU-funded Financialisation, Economy, Society and Sustainable Development (FESSUD) research project said that the benefits of finance were either overestimated or highly overestimated. They said the excessive size of the finance sector and poor regulation were the causes of the last crash. More than 70% said the flawed economic theory that underpinned a belief in financial systems as self-correcting was another factor. These economists are not from the Corbyn/Sanders wing of academia. Some advise finance firms and even sit on bank advisory boards. Nevertheless, they believe the financial services sector will continue to grow, providing investors with risky profits, while the benefits for Europeâ€™s citizens are â€œlimited and likely negativeâ€\\x9d. Worse for Carney, the economists are especially concerned about shadow banking, saying that as banks are further regulated, shadow banking will grow with, at best, loose regulation. Their views tell Carney he should lay off Vickers and intervene across the entire industry to limit damage from a financial crash. If shadow finance has the ability to add a further twist to the turmoil, it will be in setting off defaults and bankruptcies across businesses and households, while having only a fraction of the weakened checks and balances on the banks. It goes to show regulators need more bite and less bark.',\n",
              "  \"Depp and Heard's biosecurity thriller ends in lo-fi hostage video â€“ review Hollywood A-lister Johnny Depp has delivered a startling fall-from-grace character portrait in the final act of the legal/biosecurity thriller nobody expected: one part intrepid dog movie and two parts international relations drama, like The International by way of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, with a dash of Midnight Express thrown in. The pulse-pounding first act starts with a clock-is-ticking twist, harking back to Deppâ€™s 1995 political action movie, Nick of Time. In that film, the actor was assigned an hour and a half to escape political hot water in the 90s; in this, he and his partner/co-star, Amber Heard, are granted a more generous 50 hours by the Australian agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. Joyce makes a fairly deranged villain; the coupleâ€™s dogs, he snarls, will be executed by the government if Heard and Depp fail to remove them from the country in time. Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo radiate a natural if understated gravitas in their breakthrough performances. Thus a moral dilemma to springboard the second act: who do we root for? The bad arse, blasÃ©, aviator-clad, double-earring wearing hunk and his beautiful partner (Heard is terrific here; her doe-eyed presence recalls the early work of French New Wave pioneer Anna Karina)? Or the burly, weatherbeaten borderline psychopath, who just threatened to use federal powers to execute the coupleâ€™s adorable tiny dogs? It is a difficult choice. Tension slackens in the second act, as the key players spend more time independent of each other, and the plot takes on some implausible developments. In an improbable turn of events, Joyce becomes the deputy prime minister of Australia: surely an act of over-reaching on behalf of the screenwriters. A second unexpected twist sees Heard take centre stage and emerge as the key player. Media outlets the world over had reported Pistol and Boo as Deppâ€™s dogs; he was therefore at the core of the narrative. Few people could have anticipated Heard would emerge as the protagonist, a sort of reverse The Lady Vanishes. She was here all the time. And nobody, bar nobody, could possibly have imagined how this sensational affair would end. First, thereâ€™s a courtroom scene â€“ more sombre than suspenseful â€“ in which a repentant Heard pleads guilty to falsifying an immigration document. But itâ€™s the final scene thatâ€™s surprise clincher: rough and tense, like a home-shot version of Black Mirror crossed with London Has Fallen. Or, more simply, something that looks quite a lot like a hostage video. Talking direct-to-cam in a low-angle shot, Depp on the left and Heard on the right, the pair sit in front of nondescript off-white curtains appearing stiff and solemn, looking like botched statuettes from the worldâ€™s saddest Madame Tussauds museum. Heard speaks of Australiaâ€™s â€œtreasure trove of unique plantsâ€\\x9d and Depp morosely advises viewers to â€œdeclare everything when you enter Australiaâ€\\x9d. He performs a small nod of his head but to who? To the audience, in a fourth-wall-breaking moment? Or to somebody just off-screen? Could Joyce also be there, holding up a script for the pair to read while their entourage sit in the adjacent room with potato sacks on their heads? Like the final, cryptic shot in the great Austrian director Michael Hanekeâ€™s psychological thriller Hidden, we canâ€™t ever be sure.\",\n",
              "  'Premier League 2016-17 preview: 11 things to look out for this season 1. Manchester manager wars So here it is â€“ the long-awaited new series of Pep versus JosÃ©. Neutrals are hoping for a classic rerun of the meltdowns that made the Barcelona/Real Madrid years so special â€“ but early signs are that both managers are making an effort to coexist. Last month Guardiola denied heâ€™d spend the season refusing to shake Mourinhoâ€™s hand (â€œWe are polite guys, why not shake, why not shake? No reasonâ€\\x9d), and JosÃ© says heâ€™s completely over it. â€œIndividual fights make no sense in England. If I focus on him and he on me, someone else is going to win the league.â€\\x9d They meet for the first time at Old Trafford on 10 September. Time will tell. 2. ArsÃ¨ne Wengerâ€™s farewell tour? Away from that excitement, everything feels pretty familiar at the Emirates. On 1 October it will be 20 years since ArsÃ¨ne Wenger took over: 20 years since he told the sceptics: â€œI am like every human - I have my weaknesses. I would say to you I try every day to be better than the day before, but I am conscious that I have to win over the supporters. They donâ€™t know me.â€\\x9d Two decades later, they do know him, but the â€œwinning overâ€\\x9d process is still ongoing. Signs are this will be Wengerâ€™s last at the club. Could it end in glory? 3. Zlatanâ€™s impact Having trailed his Old Trafford move with a Hollywood hashtag â€“ â€œ#iamcomingâ€\\x9d â€“ self-billed â€œkingâ€\\x9d and â€œlegendâ€\\x9d Zlatan Ibrahimovic needs to deliver early on. But, generously, he says heâ€™s prepared to share the headlines with colleagues, including Wayne Rooney. â€œEvery big player can work with other big players. Thatâ€™s not a problem. I see no problems here. Just success.â€\\x9d 4. Leicesterâ€™s tricky encore How do you follow a fairytale? Do it all over again, or slip into graceful decline? Nâ€™Golo KantÃ© is gone, and pre-season has been testing â€“ a 4-0 defeat to PSG and 4-2 to Barcelona â€“ but key title-winners remain, including Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, Danny Drinkwater and captain Wes Morgan. Last season Claudio Ranieri said Morgan was â€œBaloo off the Jungle Book. He is a big gentle bear. He does not speak so much but when he does speak, everybody listens. He is the perfect captain.â€\\x9d 5. The reinvention of David Moyes Itâ€™s been a tough few years. Humiliated at United, Moyes achieved meme status when this photo of him meeting fans at Old Trafford went viral â€“ captioned online: â€œI have no idea what is happeningâ€\\x9d. Then came 12 grim months at Real Sociedad. But now heâ€™s back, at a club much more like Everton. â€œIn my first season at Everton, after the club had continually avoided relegation, I think we finished seventh,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWill that happen with Sunderland? It will be very difficult, but I have to believe thereâ€™s a possibility.â€\\x9d Expect heavy last-minute spending: Christian Benteke has been linked. 6. New-look homes Weâ€™re all invested in West Hamâ€™s new ground, literally. The Â£701m stadium, with the club chipping in Â£15m, opened last week, and is a world away from Green Street. The rebrand is neat â€“ but no amount of green sheeting is going to disguise that 30m gap between the stand and the pitch. Elsewhere, Liverpool will unveil their new Â£114m Main Stand. They paid for it themselves. 7. Hullâ€™s new managerâ€¦ â€¦ is already, before being appointed, being tipped as this seasonâ€™s sack race winner. Hullâ€™s pre-season bid for crisis-club status has been slick: Steve Bruce walking away, Mohamed DiamÃ© sold down a division to Newcastle, no signings and Assem Allam still in charge. So expect to see a rare sight on the opening day: fans of a newly-promoted club protesting against their board. Hull face champions Leicester in Saturdayâ€™s television curtain-raiser (12.30pm on Sky). 8. A new corporate visual identity Always a thrilling moment: a corporate brand identity refresh â€“ the Premier Leagueâ€™s old Barclays logo gone, and, in its place, a new range of expensive fluorescent sponsor-free logos, which attracted online mockery when they were unveiled in February. League officials called the new branding â€œa bold and vibrant identity that includes a modern take on the lion iconâ€\\x9d; everyone else saw it as primary school-style tribute to Aslan. Elsewhere, other badge tweaks this season include Manchester Cityâ€™s new heritage-led logo, and West Ham removing the Boleyn Castle from their badge and adding the word â€œLondonâ€\\x9d, to help sell the global brand. 9. Which way are Stoke headed? Will Stoke finish ninth for a fourth consecutive season? Or is something less comfortable in store? Mark Hughes â€“ who starts the campaign with a neat new Jeremy Corbyn beard â€“ has some serious momentum-correcting work to do after last seasonâ€™s run-in â€“ as does Alan Pardew at Palace, who oversaw two wins in 21 league games before dancing his way to FA Cup final defeat. And, also looking unpredictable among the usual mid-table candidates: the newly wealthy Everton. Ronald Koeman has found his kitty hard to spend so far, but heâ€™s trying. â€œWe are working hard to bring in players. I expect better quality on the ball.â€\\x9d 10. Geometric fuse-welding Back with the marketing department, hereâ€™s Nike describing this seasonâ€™s new official ball, the Ordem 4 â€“ featuring a â€œnew wrapped bladder system delivering optimal touch; geometric 12 panel fuse-welded construction employing a new 3D printed ink technique; plus the design principle of â€˜Flow Motionâ€™ applying luminance.â€\\x9d In other words, itâ€™s round and colourful. The Premier League ball is blue, green and purple, La Ligaâ€™s is navy, orange and yellow, Serie Aâ€™s is orange, pink and purple. Collect all three for Â£285. 11. New rules 95 law changes were announced in May, so expect a long season of indignant mixed-up punditry. Apart from backwards kick-offs, other changes include no more automatic reds for players who accidentally deny a scoring opportunity and an end to forcing injured players to leave the field after quick treatment. But likely to have the biggest impact are changes around dissent. This season itâ€™s an automatic yellow for â€œshowing visible disrespect to officialsâ€\\x9d; for â€œrunning towards an official to contest a decisionâ€\\x9d; for making any physical contact with officials; and itâ€™s a yellow â€œfor at least one player when two or more surround a match officialâ€\\x9d. Players who add aggression or abuse to any of the above will upgrade to an automatic red. Stand by for mass suspensions.',\n",
              "  'Abbas Kiarostami obituary Following the Iranian revolution in 1979, the countryâ€™s vibrant and original cinema took its place on the world stage. Among the many superb film directors who contributed to Iranâ€™s new wave the most celebrated was Abbas Kiarostami, who has died aged 76. Kiarostami, whose subtly enigmatic films play brilliantly with audiencesâ€™ preconceptions, was considered one of the greatest directors in contemporary world cinema. Of all the new wave cinemas, the Iranian was probably the most surprising, because it emerged from under an authoritarian religious regime. Kiarostami managed, on the whole, to avoid censorship by the government; rather than confront the censorship office, he accepted their general guidelines â€“ and working within the framework, made films that imply meaning beyond it. He was born into a large middle-class family in Tehran. His father, Ahmad, was a painter of frescoes on walls and ceilings, and as a child, Abbasâ€™s expectations were to be a painter and designer. After winning an art competition in his late teens, he studied painting and graphic design at the University of Tehran. In the 1960s, he worked as a commercial artist, designing posters and eventually shooting scores of television advertisements. At the same time, he designed credit titles for films and illustrated childrenâ€™s books. During the period when a handful of Iranian films were starting to be shown in the west, thanks mainly to the success of Dariush Mehrjuiâ€™s The Cow (1969), Kiarostami helped found a film-making department at the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults in Tehran. It was there that he made several short films aimed at, and about, children. The 60-minute film The Experience (1973) continued in that line, focusing on the efforts of a young man to attract a girl with whom he is infatuated. Kiarostamiâ€™s first feature, The Traveler (1974), released internationally only in the 1990s after he became famous, is a well-observed, witty and touching film about a 10-year-old boyâ€™s determination to obtain enough money, by hook or by crook, to get from his small town to a big football match in Tehran. In contrast, The Report (1977) was an adult drama about a weak civil servant, accused of taking bribes, whose marriage is crumbling. Because of its â€œimmodestâ€\\x9d view of women, the film was promptly banned after the revolution, when cinema was condemned for its perceived western attitudes. In 1983, a foundation was established to encourage films with â€œIslamic valuesâ€\\x9d, from which emerged, ironically, a number of cinematic masterpieces. Taking up from his pre-revolutionary films with children at the centre, Kiarostami began the new era with Where Is the Friendâ€™s Home? (1987), a gently humorous film about a childâ€™s loyalty, reminiscent of FranÃ§ois Truffautâ€™s 400 Blows. It was to become an international success only after Kiarostami had made a name for himself with Close-Up (1990). A superb blend of documentary and narrative film making, Close-Up tells the true story of a man who pretends to be the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, in order to hoodwink a family into thinking they will be the subject of a film. This fascinating exploration into identity, fame and the illusion of film, was enacted by the real people involved. â€œI donâ€™t invent material. I just watch and take it from the daily life of people around me,â€\\x9d Kiarostami once stated. Life, and Nothing More... (1992) follows a director â€“ a Kiarostami surrogate â€“ making a film while searching for the children who featured in one of his earlier films in the hope that they had survived a severe earthquake in Iran. Through the Olive Trees (1994), set in the same area, is about a director casting and shooting another film. The most fascinating aspect of the film-within-a-film is that the audience never knows what is real and what is fiction. The celebrated final sequence follows the two main actors, who are having a â€œreal lifeâ€\\x9d romance, in extremely long shot as the boy persuades the girl to marry him. The film, at once simple and complex, intimate and distant, is full of insights into film-making, society and human relationships. Kiarostamiâ€™s trademark of people driving over long roads is perfectly illustrated in Taste of Cherry (1997), which co-won the Palme dâ€™Or at Cannes. Using long takes, a leisurely pace and periods of silence, it follows a middle-aged man who is bent on suicide (although the reason is never given). Desperately seeking people to help him, he drives up and down winding roads asking passers-by to bury him in the grave he has already dug for himself. He wants to pay someone to come around at 6am and call down to him. â€œIf I answer, pull me out. If I donâ€™t, throw in 20 shovels of earth to bury me.â€\\x9d The fact that suicide is forbidden in the Qurâ€™an explains the paradoxical ending. Continuing his minimalist style, The Wind Will Carry Us (1999) has more than 10 characters who are heard but never seen, or discussed but neither heard nor seen. This semi-comical parable of outsiders follows a three-man film crew arriving in a remote Kurdish village intent on photographing the ceremonial funeral rites of a dying 100-year-old woman for a television documentary. But she lingers on. Kiarostami made a bona fide documentary outside Iran with ABC Africa (2001), a study of the Aids epidemic in Uganda. It was his first use of a digital camera. â€œI felt that a 35mm camera would limit both us and the people there,â€\\x9d he said, â€œwhereas the video camera displayed truth from every angle, and not a forged truth... The camera could turn 360 degrees and thus reported the truth, an absolute truth.â€\\x9d The car motif reoccurs in Ten (2002), which consists of 10 long takes in close-up of a woman navigating through the streets of Tehran, during which she has conversations with various women passengers, including a prostitute, and her brat of a son. Kiarostamiâ€™s subtle criticism of the male-dominated society is reflected by the boy. Kiarostami explained why he liked to shoot characters in cars: it puts people in close proximity to allow natural two-shots and close-ups and, sociologically, it is space that allows women some freedom. In Shirin (2008), a group of 114 women of different generations are photographed in an audience, ostensibly watching a film of a 14th-century Persian tale. Unlike the casts in other Kiarostami films, these women (who include Juliette Binoche) are all professional actors, some of them banned from performing under the present regime. We watch their reactions and hear only the soundtrack of the film, using their expressions to help us imagine the story. Here are defiant women from a strict Islamic society revealing their faces, and their emotions, with a few menacing out-of-focus glimpses of men in the background. Binoche then starred in the first fiction feature that Kiarostami directed outside Iran. Certified Copy (2010) â€“ shot in Italy, with dialogue in English, French and Italian â€“ follows the relationship between a British writer (William Shimell) and a French antiques dealer (Binoche), and explores that which separates illusion from reality. Like Someone In Love (2012), elegantly shot in Japan, and in Japanese, was ostensibly even more of a distance from Kiarostamiâ€™s world. Always more interested in characters than plot, he retained his oblique view of human contacts in the study of a high-class prostitute, her jealous boyfriend and an elderly former university professor. By shooting in other countries, Kiarostami became a cosmopolitan figure, underlining how universal his film language was, though slightly diminished away from its roots. In addition to making films, Kiarostami wrote several books of poetry, had his photographs exhibited and directed a production of Mozartâ€™s CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2008. He is survived by two sons, Ahmad and Bahman, from his marriage to Parvin Amir-Gholi, which ended in divorce. â€¢ Abbas Kiarostami, film director, born 22 June 1940; died 4 July 2016',\n",
              "  \"Cinema paradiso: Bologna's magical Il Cinema Ritrovato The best festivals contain surprises, secret gigs arranged too hastily to appear in the printed programme, but which draw a discerning crowd, jumpy with anticipation. At the 30th edition of Il Cinema Ritrovato, Bolognaâ€™s annual celebration of restored and rediscovered cinema, the bonus addition to the bill was not a film-maker, or a movie, but a projector. The machine in question was a British model, made in 1899, but now once again in perfect working order. Fittingly, the projector was positioned in a piazzetta near the Cineteca di Bologna as the sun was setting, and threaded with a reel of the first films ever projected â€“ the 50-second slices of life shot by the LumiÃ¨re brothers in 1895. A spark of electricity between two carbon electrodes in the projector illuminated the screen, and while the handle was patiently turned, the faces and bodies of our 19th-century forebears appeared. The films, more than a century old and already familiar to most in the audience, had a new crackle of authenticity, which was due to more than just the flickering caused by the Victorian mechanics. The relatively small frame thrown on to the canvas, the fluttering light as the carbon lamp fizzed and sputtered, and the drama of the occasion prompted a few strained necks and gasps of pleasure. This was how our ancestors would have watched the first films â€“ perhaps with more excitement, but less hushed respect. The technology was on display as much as the films themselves, with a microphone placed close to the machine so that its constant whirr would harmonise with the piano accompaniment. Having completed its short programme without a visible hitch, the vintage projector was wheeled away and the eveningâ€™s advertised entertainment could begin. Another carbon lamp projector, but larger, and less ancient, showed Jean Epsteinâ€™s beautiful coastal romance Coeur FidÃ¨le (1923). The impressionist style of that film, with its superimpositions and haunting closeups contrasting with a grimy setting, was as apt an illustration as you could find of how later silent film-makers built on the work of the LumiÃ¨re brothers, transforming their techniques and eye for composition into a visual poetry. Elsewhere in the week, the same carbon glow would be bestowed on outdoor screenings of Hollywoodâ€™s first adaptation of Stella Dallas, an accomplished and wonderfully poignant film from 1925, and a programme of shorts from the 1900s, featuring glimpses of astonishingly vivid hand-applied colour. At this yearâ€™s festival, amid a more than generous selection of films and talks covering all decades of cinema history, there were many such opportunities to connect with the beginnings of the medium. The immensely popular series of screenings covering the pre-code escapades of producer Carl Laemmle Jr at Universal featured the roving, â€œunchainedâ€\\x9d camera-work of cinematographer Karl Freund, who gave German expressionist silents Metropolis (1927) and The Last Laugh (1924) such emotional unease. That strand also contained Paul Leniâ€™s crackpot The Last Warning (1929), a haunted-theatre yarn that mines all the gimmicks of the silent-film playbook for shocks and giggles. An overdue, and excellent, restoration of silent veteran Lewis Milestoneâ€™s talkie The Front Page (1931) created room to enjoy its claustrophobic, circling camera-work in the poky press room as much as the celebrated machine-gun dialogue. And the stunt-fighting and physical comedy of Tay Garnettâ€™s sleazy romantic drama Her Man surely owed a debt to the era of great silent slapstick that was just ending when it was made in 1930. That magical screening of Coeur FidÃ¨le was part of one of my favourite strands at this yearâ€™s Ritrovato: that devoted to Marie Epstein. The sister of the well-known director Jean herself worked as an actor, screenwriter and director, before spending the later part of her career preserving films at the CinÃ©matheque FranÃ§aise with Henri Langlois (she acted in, and co-wrote, Coeur FidÃ¨le). Working with co-director Jean BenoÃ®t-LÃ©vy, Epsteinâ€™s greatest successes among the films shown in Bologna this year showcased great child acting, as in the rural silent Peau de PÃªche (1928), or the magnificent ballet-school drama La Mort du Cygne (1937), an unforgettable, juvenile Black Swan. The intensity of emotion and clarity of drama in these films often rendered the festivalâ€™s offering of simultaneous translation redundant. Silent films burst forth in other strands of the festival, most notably the Restored and Rediscovered programme, and the section devoted to centenarian titles. In the former, Czech social drama TakÃ½ je Å¾ivot (Such Is Life, 1929) was perhaps the most remarkable discovery: a female-led drama starring Vera Baranovskaja, which lays bare the deprivations of urban poverty. The film is notable for its minimalist intertitles Â\\xadâ€“ they are used only as chapter headings, with proverbs attached to each day in its week-long structure. The plot, comprising multiple characters and small but crucial incidents, is told entirely visually. Avant-garde dancer Valeska Gert adds spice as a minxy waitress. Another highlight was a showing of Volker SchlÃ¶ndorffâ€™s sharp, gossipy film portrait (Nur Zum Spass â€“ Nur Zum Spiel, 1977) of this amazing performer, who spent most of her career on the stage but made indelible appearances in films by Pabst and Fellini, among others. British silent Shooting Stars (1928) showed us one of the earliest and best examples of the industry turning its focus, and its humour, inward â€“ while an original Technicolor print of Singinâ€™ in the Rain (1952) repeated the jokes at a safer distance. Der MÃ¼de Tod (1921), one of Fritz Langâ€™s shorter (98 minutes) and earlier â€œmonumental filmsâ€\\x9d, was presented with its original colour tinting revived. A restoration of Pola Negriâ€™s whip-cracking comedy A Woman of the World (1925) brought some very 1920s humour, and sexual double standards, to a modern audience, and a screening of Clarence Brownâ€™s sizzling Flesh and the Devil (1926), starring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert, played to a packed house. A screening of DW Griffithâ€™s epic Intolerance (1916), with live musical accompaniment, running for more than three hours, would normally be a gala event, but here it was just one of the juiciest titbits in the section devoted to films from 1916. Pre-revolutionary Russian films, early Hollywood genre pictures and precocious work by names such as Frank Borzage, Allan Dwan and Douglas Fairbanks revealed a picture of a lively and ambitious year in film history, including the last gasps of Europeâ€™s dominance in the world market. There couldnâ€™t be a celebration of silent cinema without Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, though, who were both featured strongly in the programme. Having completed restoration work on Chaplinâ€™s films, Cineteca has started on those of his stone-faced peer, with The Keaton Project. Some of those new prints were shown: shorts The High Sign (1921), The Paleface (1922) and Cops (1922), as well the hour-long caper Seven Chances (1925), appeared across the week. There were also al fresco screenings of two classic Chaplin features, Modern Times (1936) and The Kid (1921), in the cityâ€™s main square, the Piazza Maggiore, with live orchestral accompaniment. Throughout the festival, the silent screenings were among the most popular events, with queues forming outside the screening rooms even for obscure titles. For the Chaplin films, delegates, tourists and Bologna residents came in their thousands, thronging the square and bouncing laughter off the palazzo walls. The LumiÃ¨re brothers, who had a permanent presence in the Piazza thanks to the eye-opening exhibition devoted to their work, would have been pleasantly surprised. Louis LumiÃ¨re famously told George MÃ©liÃ¨s that his invention had no future. Little did he know that it would still be thriving more than a century later, and that its future could live so happily with its past. â€¢ For more on the festival see the Cinema Ritrovato website.\",\n",
              "  'Funding is welcome, but root causes of mental illness are growing The impression is being created of unstoppable momentum towards expansion and improvement of mental health services. Reports, cash and pledges of action are piling up. But it is hard to identify what will change and from where the money will come. Meanwhile, the problems that give rise to mental illnesses are growing. Hitting hyperbolic heights this week, NHS England promised â€œthe biggest transformation of mental health care across the NHS in a generationâ€\\x9d. In the wake of the report (pdf) by the Mental Health Taskforce, led by Mind chief executive Paul Farmer, NHS England pledged to help millions more people and invest more than Â£1bn a year by 2020â€“21. The commitment of NHS England and the government to giving mental health the focus it deserves is not in doubt. What is problematic is their ability to deliver on the promises being made. Announcing telephone number-sized quantities of cash to â€œtransformâ€\\x9d the NHS is now routine, but the shine soon fades as the realities of tight funding kick in. First it was the Â£3.8bn Better Care Fund in June 2013, a laudable attempt to encourage clinical commissioning groups and councils to join up health and social care. But this has been overwhelmed by the need to reduce emergency hospital admissions and tackle delays in transferring frail elderly patients from hospitals back to the community. So the fund views the care system through the narrow lens of hospital admissions and bed occupancy, doing little to bring about anything that could be described as transformation. Then in December 2015 the government announced the NHS would receive Â£1.8bn in 2016â€“17 as part of a Sustainability and Transformation Fund to â€œgive the NHS the time and space it needs to put transformation plans in placeâ€\\x9d for changes such as seven-day working and the new models of care described in the Five Year Forward View. But analysis by the Nuffield Trust has revealed that very little of this money will be used for transformation. In its first year all but around Â£339m will be consumed in backfilling hospital deficits. Now we have a promise to invest in the transformation of mental health. Aims include seven-day access to support for those experiencing a mental health crisis, and integration of physical and mental health care. This is in addition to Â£1.25bn announced in the dying weeks of the Coalition government for perinatal, child and young peopleâ€™s mental health services. Yet funding for mental health trusts in England has been falling. According to figures published by the BBC last week, budgets for mental health trusts fell 2% between 2013â€“14 and 2014â€“15, while funding for hospital trusts climbed 2.6%. In the current year, mental health trust funding will increase by just 0.3%. While this is not the totality of mental health services, it demonstrates that the talk in recent years has so far failed to even stem the relative decline in investment, let alone begin to close the chasm in access between physical and mental health services. Meanwhile, too many of the root causes of mental health problems continue to grow. The number of rough sleepers in England jumped 55% between 2010 and 2015, according to the government; research by the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (pdf) indicates around 2.8 million children are living with an alcohol-dependent parent, up from 2 million in 1992; according to Paul Farmerâ€™s report, two in five older people living in care homes are affected by depression, while a BMA conference of GPs recently voted in favour of GPs no longer having responsibility for care home residents, arguing their complex needs are beyond the capacity of primary care services. And there were 89 prison suicides in England and Wales last year, an increase of 46% in three years. This catalogue of misery emphasises the extraordinary breadth of public policy that needs to be aligned to improve the nationâ€™s mental well-being. Funding is just the start.

              "  \"Government could save $175m a year by ending pathology companies' â€˜free rideâ€™ The federal government could save $175m each year by ending the â€œfree rideâ€\\x9d it has given to pathology companies, a leading health economist, Stephen Duckett, says. Duckett has called for reform to the way pathology is paid for so the massive efficiency savings the industry enjoys are shared with taxpayers and the government The federal government announced in its budget update in December that it would scrap the bulk-billing incentive it pays to health professionals for pathology services, representing savings of $101m per year. As a result, the pathology industry has threatened to pass the costs onto patients by introducing a $30 co-payment for common tests, including pap smears. But according to the report from the Grattan Institute released on Sunday and co-authored by Duckett, greater savings could be made by reforming a â€œdecades-oldâ€\\x9d pathology payment system that overwhelmingly benefits pathology companies over the government and taxpayers. It is a view that has been dismissed by the pathology industry, which has slammed the Grattan report, called Blood Money: Paying for Pathology Services, as nothing more than â€œopinionâ€\\x9d based on flawed data. Over the past decade, the average number of pathology tests per person has risen by 40% from around 3.9 per person in the population in 2004-05, to 5.4 per head in 2014-15. An ageing population with more complex health conditions is responsible for much of this increase. â€œAs test volumes increase, we would expect to see efficiency improve and average rebates come down commensurately,â€\\x9d the report says. â€œPathology rebates have declined in real terms, but only by about 10% relative to volume increases of 40%. Many aspects of pathology are now highly automated, which means additional tests can be performed for very little cost. However, in Australia, rebates are fixed for each test and do not vary directly with volume of tests ordered.â€\\x9d The current Pathology Funding Agreement between the government and the pathology industry is due to expire in June. Duckett told Australia â€œthe industry has been getting a free rideâ€\\x9d. â€œMedicare pays a fixed price per test,â€\\x9d he said. â€œFor the pathology companies, the more tests they do, the less each subsequent test costs. So why canâ€™t the government and the taxpayer share some of those savings?â€\\x9d Reforming existing funding arrangements to share the benefits of this scale economy could yield savings of around $75m per year, while further savings of around $100m a year could be made by abolishing the bulk-billing incentive for pathology providers and requiring participating pathology companies to bulk bill all services, the report says. Additional savings could be made if the government opened pathology services to a tender process, the report says, with two major companies currently controlling 75% of the industry. â€œThe point is there is no price competition,â€\\x9d Duckett said. â€œThe government sets the price and the pathology companies donâ€™t have to compete. Through a tender process, public hospitals and smaller companies could enter the market, which is big enough to have some competition in it.â€\\x9d But Liesel Wett, chair of Pathology Australia, the peak body for private pathology, said the data used in the report was problematic and did not account for all the savings the industry had passed on to the government. â€œPathology Australia has had an initial review of the opinion piece on pathology funding by Stephen Duckett,â€\\x9d she said. â€œOn that initial review it is clear that most of the data used is incorrect and incomplete, and as a result the conclusions are also incorrect. Australian pathology is amongst the most efficient in the world.â€\\x9d Dr Michael Harrison, the president of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, also described the report as â€œopinionâ€\\x9d. â€œPathology fees are 12% less than they were in the year 2000, and the efficiency dividends that have come back to the government in this time represents savings of more than 40%,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThe government has been getting the savings.â€\\x9d He said the report also failed to account for coning rules, which mean when a GP orders pathology tests, the government only pays for the three most expensive and any subsequent tests required are free. â€œThe government is getting a huge discount through that process,â€\\x9d Harrison said. But Duckett said even though only the first three tests are charged to the government, the costs of running the second test were lower than the first, and the cost of the third test lower still. Yet all three tests were still paid for in full by Medicare. â€œConing certainly yields savings, which we actually do acknowledge in the report,â€\\x9d Duckett said. â€œBut that doesnâ€™t mean there isnâ€™t room for more savings to be made. Itâ€™s very easy for lobby groups to say costs have gone down, but that doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ve gone down enough. Our firm view is that there is much more room for taxpayers and the government to share in industry savings.â€\\x9d In response to the federal governmentâ€™s plans to scrap the bulk-billing incentive for pathology companies, the pathology industry has warned it would have no choice but to pass the costs onto patients by introducing a $30 patient co-payment for blood, urine and pap smear tests. But the health minister, Sussan Ley, said the Grattan report confirmed the pathology industry had â€œno justifiable groundsâ€\\x9d for doing so. â€œIt is further proof this is nothing but a tacky scare campaign by stock exchange-listed pathology companies aimed at protecting their profits by unfairly playing on the fears of some of our most anxious and vulnerable patients,â€\\x9d Ley said. â€œAs this timely report points out it is actually a series of questionable business decisions, aggressive acquisitions and dud property deals undertaken by these pathology companies which are the real drivers behind a â€˜convenient excuseâ€™ to try and introduce a patient co-payment.â€\\x9d The chief executive officer of the Consumers Health Forum, Leanne Wells, said patients would be spared the threatened co-payment for pathology, and taxpayers could save hundreds of millions if the lucrative pathology industry were subject to much-needed market-based reforms. â€œThis significant report from the Grattan Institute shines a fresh light on the pathology costs issue and shows that we as taxpayers and consumers are already paying too much for pathology tests,â€\\x9d she said. â€œThe analysis provides some support for the stand taken by the Health Minister, Sussan Ley, that Medicare payments are not provided to guarantee the revenue of publicly-listed companies.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Air fresheners, joss sticks, deodorants â€“ and other killers in our midst Lemon and pine air fresheners. Solvents seeping slowly from plastics, paints and furnishings. Composite wood furniture and fittings, household cleaning products and DIY sealants and fillers. Foam insulation, insecticides, scanners, joss sticks, open fires, deodorants, dust mites, mould and dander from dogs and cats. These are some of the bewildering range of apparently innocuous household objects â€“ and animals â€“ that may be killing us indoors, according to a new report from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Heath. Most of us spend most of our lives indoors. So, how can we improve the air we breathe? We should live more like our grandmothers and throw open the windows of our homes for a few minutes every day, says Professor Stephen Holgate, an asthma expert at the University of Southampton who led the report. Modern, energy-efficient homes may be less leaky, but that means it is vital to introduce fresh air to dilute chemical pollution and remove moisture, which encourages moulds. Of course, if the air isnâ€™t fresh â€“ if you live on a polluted main road, for instance â€“ this may not be such a good solution. Holgate believes there has been little scientific investigation of indoor air pollution in Britain because it is an unseen problem (unlike 1950s smog). He says there is a reluctance to â€œinterfere with industryâ€\\x9d, too. Until there is more evidence, should we use fewer domestic chemicals? â€œYes, we should. It has gone too far,â€\\x9d says Holgate. â€œThere are 15,000 chemicals circulating in an average human. Many are in tiny quantities, but we need to find out more about how these mixtures interact when they get inside the human body â€“ especially the foetus, which is very sensitive.â€\\x9d Although pollen-producing cut flowers are mentioned as a potential problem in the report, pot plants may mitigate some indoor pollution. Chemicals in air fresheners and scented household products produce formaldehyde when they react with the air. Everyday exposure can irritate the lungs and may contribute to asthma, cancers and other illnesses. A recent test for the BBCâ€™s Trust Me, Iâ€™m a Doctor suggested that house plants such as the humble spider plant can reduce levels of formaldehyde. (Formaldehyde is also emitted by furniture; the US has set legal limits for formaldehyde emissions from wood products such as MDF at 0.09 parts a million.) â€œWe canâ€™t introduce laws to control what people do in their houses, but we can make people aware,â€\\x9d says Holgate. He hopes that more people will buy portable air-pollution monitors, which work with apps to measure air quality â€“ a bit like personal fitness-monitors. Once we can measure bad air, we can avoid it. â€œThatâ€™s real people power,â€\\x9d says Holgate. â€œThatâ€™s going to change things.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Zayn Malik: Mind of Mine review â€“ downbeat sex jams drive assured rebrand Despite his protests of ignorance, the timing of Zayn Malikâ€™s debut solo album, Mind of Mine, feels pretty significant. It comes out a year ago to the day after he released a statement confirming heâ€™d left One Direction, the juggernaut, X Factor-created boyband that had propelled him from a slightly bored-looking teenager to a slightly bored-looking, incredibly wealthy adult. After leaving the group, he explained that he wanted to be â€œa normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlightâ€\\x9d. Months after a very public spat with producer Naughty Boy, signing a solo deal with RCA Records and starting a relationship with model and reality TV star Gigi Hadid after an acrimonious split with his pop star fiancÃ© Perrie Edwards, however, it appears he simply got bored of being normal. Set among the perma-smiling, chino-sporting lineup of One Direction, there was always something oddly compelling about Malikâ€™s indifference. Rarely the most vocal in interviews or the most animated onstage (his moves largely boiled down to fiddling with his ear piece and pouting), his allure came from seemingly doing nothing at all. It was like he was chiselled from marble; blank but intriguing. While the smart money went on Harry Styles to forge a solo career, Malik took on the Robbie Williams role, a twinkly-eyed loose cannon who loves his mum but who couldnâ€™t keep himself out of the tabloids (weed smoking, allegations of affairs, terrible tattoos). If various interviews are to be believed, he has barely spoken to his former bandmates since. Itâ€™s this outsider status â€“ along with his hasty derision for his old bandâ€™s music â€“ that makes his transition from Mumfordesque ballads and pepped-up pop anthems to weed-fuelled downbeat sex jams on Mind of Mine feel like less of a stretch than if Niall Horan had done it. The importance of getting the first single right means recent UK and US No 1 Pillowtalk is basically a checklist of heavy-handed, Iâ€™m-a-man-not-a-boy rebellion. So thereâ€™s swearing (â€œfucking and fightingâ€\\x9d to â€œpiss off the neighboursâ€\\x9d), alongside that Weeknd-esque trope of conflating pain and pleasure into one woozy, weed-filled 4am tryst. Thereâ€™s also lashings of overwrought guitar, as though rockâ€™nâ€™roll still signals danger. Thankfully, Malik settles into a less ham-fisted groove as the album unfolds (although its title and artwork both suggest he hasnâ€™t completely mastered subtlety yet). The excellent first half showcases his Frank Oceanesque falsetto on the sad-eyed, organ-drenched Itâ€™s You (produced by Channel Orangeâ€™s main producer, Malay), and on Befourâ€™s pulsating electro-throb thereâ€™s a head-spinning vocal performance you donâ€™t tend to get from a former boyband members, Justin Timberlake aside. Perhaps the albumâ€™s highlight is the double whammy of mid-tempo standouts She and Drunk, with the former featuring a fairly cold and distant lyric about Malik offering no solace to someone in need (â€œShe wants somebody to love, to hold herâ€\\x9d), while the latterâ€™s percolating emotion finally offers a glimpse behind the cool-guy exterior (â€œRed eyes, amnesia, I need ya,â€\\x9d he coos). From the lovely, pastoral intermission Flower (sung in Urdu in recognition of Malikâ€™s Pakistani heritage), the albumâ€™s quality dips slightly, the downcast tempo and reverb-heavy finger-click beats becoming vaporous by the time he and Kehlani swap hazily lustful lines on Wrong (weirdly, the excellent, upbeat Like I Would is relegated to the deluxe edition). Thereâ€™s still time for surprising moments â€“ Fool For Youâ€™s Lennon-inspired piano-lead ballad, the lovely Rear View (â€œIt sounds like you need a friendâ€\\x9d) and the glitchy Timberlake-isms of the closing TIO â€“ but the meandering Lucozade is a chorus-less mumble, while the slowburn Truth is lost in the second-half fog. The lasting impression of Mind of Mine, however, is of someone finally making the music theyâ€™ve wanted to make for a long time. That the sound heâ€™s chosen â€“ clipped beats, hazy production flourishes, oodles of falsetto as a shortcut for emotional honesty â€“ is basically 2016 writ large may seem bandwagon-jumping, but thereâ€™s more than enough good stuff here to suggest itâ€™s been created with love rather than with an eye on ticking boxes. You sense heâ€™s had enough of the latter to last him a lifetime.',\n",
              "  'In an electronic world, cash still has currency Kenneth Rogoff (Why cash isnâ€™t king any more, theguardian.com, 5 September) erroneously suggests that a less-cash society would be â€œfairer and saferâ€\\x9d. His thesis is that cash payments aid and abet the underground economy and that we should gradually curtail them in favour of alternative electronic payment systems. More than a dozen countries have imposed restrictions on cash payments but until now, no evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures has ever been undertaken. There does not appear to be any correlation between the size of the shadow economy and the adoption of restrictions. As Rogoff himself acknowledges, scaling back paper currency would hardly end criminal activity or tax evasion. The vast majority of cash transactions are perfectly legitimate, while the vast majority of cash users are law-abiding citizens. Making life just that little bit harder for a handful of criminals at the expense of millions of law-abiding citizens would be the ultimate example of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Cash is fundamentally about freedom. As the German central banker Carl-Ludwig Thiele observed, abolishing cash would hurt consumer sovereignty. Do we really want the state to collude with large financial institutions to know every single detail about how we spend our money and where? Moreover, curtailing cash payments in favour of alternative electronic payment systems would also have far-reaching social consequences. In terms of financial inclusion, restricting cash would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society, including young, elderly and infirm people. At a time when cash in circulation is increasing, along with the value of ATM transactions, it seems illogical of Rogoff and others to wish to discriminate against it. All of which suggests that cash still has currency, and if not king, it certainly has a prominent seat at the top table of payment methods.

              "  'Cult heroes: Deniz Tek â€“ Stooges fan and fighter pilot who took punk to Australia Over a career spanning more than 40 years as a guitarist and songwriter, Deniz Tek has been remarkably consistent, though not necessarily prolific. Tek, who is best known for his work with the Australian proto-punk band Radio Birdman, averages a studio album or EP release every two to three years, and has often gone several years between releases. However, he has a few other strings to his bow. By the time Radio Birdman released their scorching debut EP Burn My Eye in 1976, Tek was already studying medicine. He became a flight surgeon with the US navy, where he also trained as a fighter pilot, and now divides his time between rockâ€™nâ€™roll and working as a trauma surgeon in in Australia and Hawaii. Clearly, heâ€™s not one of those musicians whoâ€™s at a loss when they havenâ€™t got a gig lined up. Tek was born and grew up in the US, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he would sneak into gigs by the MC5 and the Stooges, who proved to be among his primary influences. When his father, an engineering professor, was offered a yearâ€™s secondment at the University of New South Wales in Sydney in 1967, the family temporarily relocated to Australia. After graduating from high school in the US, Tek wanted to pursue his own degree in medicine and he decided to study in Sydney. By the time he had seen the Rolling Stones on their 1972 Australian tour â€“ and sold a vintage National guitar to Keith Richards, no less â€“ it was clear that music was going to be as much a part of his life as his curative vocation. While Tek had a direct connection to the Detroit sound that had developed in his home state, Radio Birdman evolved more or less in isolation in Sydney; something that Tek believes benefited the band. Although that had its downsides â€“ Birdman were ignored and even disdained by the music industry in Australia, and had to book their own venues to play concerts â€“ it made them even more committed to their unique brand of high-energy rockâ€™nâ€™roll. When I was growing up in Australia, too young to have seen Birdman in their 1976-78 prime, the band were almost mythical. It was a code among music freaks: you may have known the Ramones and the Clash and even the Saints, but unless you knew of Birdman you were a no-mark. Their instantly recognisable logo was seen on cars, guitars, school lockers and surfboards in every town on the east coast â€“ surf music was the thing that gave Birdman their identity above and beyond the Detroit sound. Birdman dissolved acrimoniously in 1978, and despite a few appearances by key members in several post-Birdman bands, it wasnâ€™t until Tek toured Australia in 1992 that the first post-Birdman generation got to see some of their songs live (hundreds of other bands playing earnest cover versions notwithstanding). The fact that Birdmanâ€™s other guitarist, Chris Masuak, and their keyboardist, Pip Hoyle, were on board for Tekâ€™s solo tour only added to the expectation. Tek had recently retired from the US military, but he was understandably proud of his accomplishments. The solo album that formed the basis of the 1992 tour was called Take It to the Vertical, and featured a cover image of Tek in the cockpit of an F4 Phantom. That was a revelation in itself, as few Birdman fans at the time had any idea he had another career outside music. Then it turned out he was also an emergency surgeon based in Billings, Montana. For anyone who read the music press, it was obvious he was a fairly remarkable individual. But more than anything else, the concerts proved that Tekâ€™s music and his guitar playing had lost none of their power. Since then, Radio Birdman have reformed several times, and their reputation has not diminished. Tek still plays with complete commitment â€“ as he once put it, when heâ€™s on the road heâ€™s â€œhard-wired to the go switchâ€\\x9d. In 2014, at the age of 62, playing solo and Radio Birdman material in a power trio in Europe, he did 29 concerts in 28 days across eight countries. It looks as if 2016 is turning into another busy year for him: Radio Birdman are touring Australia in June, followed by a three-week European tour, and in September, Tek is releasing his sixth solo album. Heâ€™s not one for standing still â€“ and long may that continue.',\n",
              "  'The end of the night â€“ in the 80s, the Wag Club was glorious but it could never happen now As the march of gentrification and greed transforms London â€“ as well as many of the UKâ€™s other inner cities â€“ one great British institution that has fallen foul has been the nightlife business. In London, the area that has suffered the most is Soho. Once a naughty, massively inspiring little Petri dish from which the likes of David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud emerged, it is being rapidly reshaped into something resembling a homogenised shopping mall. One of the first institutions to fall foul of the evisceration of Soho was the Wag, the club Ollie Oâ€™Donnell and I founded in 1982 and which ran until 2001. When we began, Soho was really rather seedy and rundown, which was exactly what attracted the young, the groovy and the inventive. The Wag â€“ a nightclub that catered, in the main, to a gang of non-conformist mavericks â€“ was thoroughly appropriate to that crowd. Ollie and I started by packing out the Whisky a Go Go in Wardour Street every Saturday night with our own crowd, then the clubâ€™s new leaseholders asked us to run it with them full time. So we lowered the drinks and the door price (which was possible because rents were fair back then), pulled in DJs who played underground music, and the place took off. We were young and aware, so we knew what was happening and approached the running of the club with a zeal that at times dropped us in the proverbial. In November 1982, we hosted the first ever hip-hop club event in the UK, The Roxy Road Show â€“ featuring 25 artists who flew in from New York, including Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Wizard Theodore (who invented scratching), Jazzy Jay and Fab 5 Freddy, rope skipping stars the Double Dutch Girls and legendary breakdancers the Rock Steady Crew. It was complete and utter mayhem, but in a good way. The club was absolutely packed when, at my behest, then unknown graffiti artist Futura 2000 did his live spray-can art on stage and more or less asphyxiated everyone. We later made a name for ourselves by booking all the major rap acts â€“ De La Soul, Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, Eric B and Rakim, Kool Moe Dee, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E Fresh. Itâ€™s been said that we were responsible for breaking hip-hop in the UK but, for me, it made sense in every way: the acts had never played London before, and it was relatively cheap to bring them over. All it took was two or three discounted flights and a couple of nights in a friendâ€™s dadâ€™s hotel in Bloomsbury. Simple economics. Because Iâ€™d been in a band it was my job to source, book and promote the live acts. Sometimes they worked and other times they did not. Even though we all knew of Shane MacGowanâ€™s proclivities I booked Pogue Mahone just as they were starting off. The third time they played, MacGowan was so drunk I was surprised he could stand, never mind sing, but it made no difference because the show stopped after 20 minutes when he tried to hit bassist Cait Oâ€™Riordan over the head with his guitar. Then there was the legendary jazz maestro Slim Gaillard, who sold out the club but, rather in his cups, retired to the bar after two songs, fell asleep on it and woke up two hours later, his backing band and the crowd having long departed. I turned down a Prince afterparty/jam session because Iâ€™d already booked Lee â€˜Scratchâ€™ Perry on the same night. He cost us a packet, but the club was crammed so all was OK until Perry, somewhat chemically enhanced, sang the same song (his new single) 15 times and emptied the club before midnight. We lost our shirts. But there were bigger losses â€“ Bobby Womackâ€™s show was cancelled an hour before it was due to start because of a bomb scare round the corner in Leicester Square; Gil Scott Heronâ€™s gig was called off when he was arrested at Heathrow for possession of cocaine. Both had sold out and we had to refund all ticket holders, leaving us with the cost of the flights and hotel rooms. Of course, other acts were simply magnificent. I recall the surprise on Georgie Fameâ€™s face as he looked out at the crowd of immaculate mods, dressed just as they would have when he played the Flamingo (in the basement of the Whisky a Go Go) in 1962. James Brownâ€™s backing band the JBs were gobsmacked that the crowd (many in 70s kit) knew all their numbers by heart. New acts thrived, too: Sade, Fine Young Cannibals, Curiosity Killed the Cat, the Pasadenas and Swing Out Sister were all signed after shows at the Wag. The Wag was synonymous with what was happening on the street. We played a huge role in kick-starting the acid house movement by hosting sets from Marshall Jefferson, Tony Humphries, Frankie Knuckles, Todd Terry and Masters at Work, among many others, while Paul Oakenfold, Pete Tong and Andy Weatherall established their reps at the Wag. But it wasnâ€™t just about music. It was also about meeting people and showing off. Diehard regular Jonathan Ross met his wife Jane Goldman at the Wag. Designers such as John Galliano paraded their designs here; Leigh Bowery strutted his magnificent stuff; future Turner prize winners Tracey Emin and Grayson Perry were regulars; Boy George, Joe Strummer and Neneh Cherry came every week for a little dance. All the attention meant global superstars came to our little ramshackle venue (with no VIP area) for a look: David Bowie (who came a lot and filmed his Blue Jean video there), Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Prince, George Clinton, Stevie Wonder, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Karl Lagerfeld and Jean Paul Gaultier. George Michael had a fight with our DJ Fat Tony and Grace Jones had to be physically restrained after laying out an irritating bloke with a single punch. Some have said that at one point the Wag was the grooviest club on the planet, but I couldnâ€™t tell. I was too busy trying to fill a Tuesday night. None had this would have happened had we not been in our mid-20s, not that different from most of our patrons, and brave (or stupid) enough to take chances and, most importantly, had the rent not been cheap enough for us to experiment. Today, not only would I not be able to run a West End club, I wouldnâ€™t even be able to hang out in Soho, because landlords and developers have priced the young and not-so-well-off out of inner London. It has been suggested that London should follow Amsterdam, Paris, Zurich and Toulouse and appoint a night mayor to protect our after-dark businesses and the people who use them. Certainly, unless something is done we will lose the talent that has traditionally risen through our night-time economy â€“ graphic designers, artists, DJs, entertainers writers, photographers and musicians of every kind who hone their skills and develop by working with clubs and promoters. I donâ€™t think its possible to overestimate just how important this is for any city or country, and that is why Amsterdam, Paris and Zurich are protecting their nightlife. We have to follow suit before itâ€™s too late. Chris Sullivan presents The Wag Club is available now on Harmless Records.',\n",
              "  \"Temple Taggart: Donald Trump wants to 'silence his accusersâ€™ with legal threats One of the women accusing Donald Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior, Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, said on Friday she was ready to countersue the Republican presidential candidate if he carried out his promise to sue all of his accusers. Taggart, who has accused Trump of kissing her on the lips without consent, is one of 12 women who have come forward since the publication of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which the businessman boasted of kissing and groping women without their consent. Trump, who has denied all accusations against him, said last weekend he would sue all his accusers after the presidential election. Taggart, who has hired the lawyer Gloria Allred, said on Friday: â€œIâ€™m not afraid of you, Mr Trump. If you carry out your threat to sue me, I will defend myself.â€\\x9d Speaking alongside Allred at a press conference in Utah, Taggart said: â€œI felt like Mr Trump was trying to silence all of his accusers who had come forward, as well as others who might be thinking of coming forward. â€œEnough is enough. I feel like he is trying to bully and frighten us into silence. Mr Trump, that is not going to work with me.â€\\x9d Another of the 12 women who have accused Trump, Jill Harth, said on Monday she would countersue if Trump pursued legal action against her. Taggart first spoke of Trumpâ€™s alleged actions in May, telling the New York Times he kissed her twice on the mouth in 1997, when she was a 21-year-old contestant in the Miss USA pageant. The first instance allegedly took place when she first met the businessman, at a pageant rehearsal. â€œMr Trump greeted me with a hug and a kiss on my lips,â€\\x9d Taggart, who said she had been very naive and â€œ21 going on 16â€\\x9d, said on Friday. â€œI was shocked because that was the first time that any man had ever greeted me in that manner, but I ended up excusing his behavior as a way that east coast people meet each other.â€\\x9d She said the second alleged incident took place when she travelled to New York later that year, to discuss her future with Trump and to meet modeling agencies. â€œTo my surprise, Trump embraced me and kissed me on the lips for a second time,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIt was that second kiss that made me wonder what his intentions really were. â€œWhat he did made me feel so uncomfortable that I ended up cutting my trip short, bought my own plane ticket, flew home and never spoke to him again.â€\\x9d Taggart, a Republican who says she will probably vote for the independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin, said she wanted to make sure that other women feel comfortable coming forward and not frightened that Trump will call them â€œliarsâ€\\x9d and threaten legal action. â€œTimes have changed,â€\\x9d said the mother of three. â€œWomen are empowered now. And we will not tolerate being bullied any more.â€\\x9d Allred represents four women who allege inappropriate sexual behavior by the Republican nominee. â€œGroping women is completely unacceptable,â€\\x9d she said. â€œThreatening women who come forward to speak out about what they claim happened to them is also completely unacceptable. â€œI assure you, Mr Trump, they will not be left to stand alone while you attempt to trample over them with your lawsuits. Many attorneys will come to their aid. And I will be one of them.â€\\x9d Allred has a history of representing women in sexual harassment and misconduct cases, including 33 women who have accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual misconduct.\",\n",
              "  \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle: America's queen of weird hits the screen As the queen of American weird fiction, Shirley Jacksonâ€™s stories and novels have perhaps been neglected by Hollywood more than her reputation and talent would merit. Thatâ€™s possibly because Jacksonâ€™s vast oeuvre could be deemed largely unfilmable for modern audiences, relying on the building of tension, dread and disquiet through the subtle progression of narratives that are in many cases built on internal monologues. Now, though, one of Jacksonâ€™s best-loved novels is coming to the big screen in the shape of her 1961 triumph â€“ and to my mind her best book â€“ We Have Always Lived in the Castle. The Hollywood Reporter revealed this week that filming began in Dublin this month on an adaptation co-produced by Michael Douglas and directed by Stacie Passon, in what is the centenary year of Jacksonâ€™s birth. The first star announced was Sebastian Stan, who played the Winter Soldier in the Captain America movies. Stanâ€™s role as Charles Blackwood, while an important one in the plot, is relatively minor compared to the two main characters, Constance and Mary Katherine Blackwood, and their casting announcements came later on Wednesday â€“ Alexandra Daddario (from the Percy Jackson series) will play elder sibling Constance, while American Horror Storyâ€™s Taissa Farmiga will be Mary Katherine â€“ Merricat to her small family. Constance and Merricat exist together with their rather befuddled Uncle Julian in a rambling, tumbledown pile, all that remains of a once grand dynasty which was all but wiped out when someone put arsenic into the sugar bowl which most of the family sprinkled on their desert. Elder sister Constance is generally thought to have committed the deed, though nothing could be proved. Still, the townsfolk are convinced that was the case and the killings have passed into local legend, children singing rhymes about the deaths to Merricat as she ventures infrequently into civilisation to gather supplies. They live a life of sequestered, fading grandeur, which is only interrupted with the arrival of cousin Charles, who begins to court pale Constance. But is he just trying to get his hands on the family silver? And tensions are rising between the Blackwoods and the townsfolk â€¦ A gothic enough tale, but related in such pedestrian terms barely scratches the surface of Jacksonâ€™s novel. The devil is in the detail of We Have Always Lived in the Castle, the story told through the eyes of troubled Merricat and her unsettling rituals â€“ she hangs totems and fetishes around the bounds of the Blackwood land to protect the remains of the family â€“ and her thoughts are very dark indeed. The novel is a masterpiece of the macabre, and the tension ratcheted up by Jackson, who died in 1965 after being troubled with demons of her own in the shape of painkillers and alcohol, is almost unbearable. As such, it is difficult to see just how it could be packaged up for cinema audiences who perhaps like their blockbusters big on action and light on twisted introspection. However, with director Passon also having a credit for the Amazon Studiosâ€™ transgender drama Transparent as well as the Sundance hit Concussion, which she wrote and directed, perhaps she has an eye for the offbeat which might just pull off the adaptation. If so, an impressive adaptation of a Shirley Jackson novel will have been a long-time coming. Only two of her stories have made it to the big screen â€“ 1957â€™s Lizzie, based on her short story The Birdâ€™s Nest being the first. Perhaps Jacksonâ€™s most famous novel, The Haunting of Hill House, has been filmed twice, both times as The Haunting. The 1963 version of this story of a group of psychics invited to stay at a haunted house is by far the best, transferring Jacksonâ€™s prose into cramped monochrome menace with the unforgettable scene where one character sharing a bed with another talks of her growing fears, only to find when the light is switched on that her roommate is nowhere near. So whose hand has she been holding? The less said about the fairly execrable 1999 remake the better. Perhaps Jacksonâ€™s most famous short story, The Lottery, has been adapted three times, twice for television (though the 1996 version is only loosely based on Jacksonâ€™s story, and attempts to form some kind of sequel) and once as a short film in 1969. Whether We Have Always Lived In The Castle is indeed even capable of being successfully filmed weâ€™ll have to wait and see. But if it opens up Jacksonâ€™s work to a wider audience in her centenary year, then itâ€™ll have some merit at least.\",\n",
              "  'What working as an FGM counsellor taught me about female sexuality I had the birds and the bees conversation with my daughter when she was around four years old. I told her that sex is an act that two consenting adults choose to do and I stressed that nobody should touch her body in any way that makes her uncomfortable. We have revisited this conversation over the years. I told her that her genitals are called a vagina, not fanny, nunnie, minnie or down there. I was sick and tired of the pervading belief that women and girls canâ€™t describe our body parts directly. Now nearly 10 years after that conversation (sheâ€™s just turned 14) teenage hormones are in full swing, with eye rolling and tuning me out while listening to Rihanna. But I love the fact we have frank open conversations about most things and I truly treasure the times we donâ€™t agree. I love that she has her own views about the world. With that in mind, I want to share some thoughts about my work that made me think of my daughter and the pressure girls around the world face in relation to their sexuality. As part of my work with the Dahlia Project, a counselling service I founded for women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), I run sessions for refugee women where I talk about the cultures they grew up in. The discussion always leads to sex, and a recurring theme is virginity. Many of the women are educated and considered liberal in their way of thinking. They say their daughters are equal to their sons. However, they also say they want their daughters to remain virgins to protect them from harm and so that future husbands will respect them. What interests me about these conversations is that the women openly talked about being cheated on or beaten by their so-called respectful husbands. I nudged the women to reflect. â€œDid remaining a virgin work for you?â€\\x9d I asked. â€œDid it prevent the violence and betrayal he had caused you?â€\\x9d Many were baffled by my questions. By our second session some of the women were starting to realise that cultural patriarchy was alive and well in their homes, and they were complicit in committing the oppression they had endured against their own daughters. Sadly I only had two sessions with these women, and they left me questioning this universal obsession with virginity. I remember newspaper articles about Kate Middleton, being slut-shamed in newspaper articles for not being a virgin before marriage and rumour has it Diana had to prove her virginity before marrying Prince Charles. If a woman is sexually free or has multiple partners, society shames her and makes her feel bad about herself. While dating Iâ€™ve been asked how many men Iâ€™ve slept with. This idea of being judged based on the history of my vagina is absolutely ludicrous and another form of control of womenâ€™s sexuality. My brother and all the men in my life are never asked such questions yet alone judged on them. Society high-fives men with multiple sexual partners. I had my first sexual experience at the age of 18 with my then husband (Iâ€™m currently happily divorced). I didnâ€™t make the choice to stay a virgin. I did so for two reasons. Firstly, I wasnâ€™t the girl boys were lining up to date. I was a super nerd who didnâ€™t wear makeup or pluck her eyebrows. So, no temptation or struggle for me. Secondly, my mother told me sex was great and nothing to be ashamed about. As a teenager I wasnâ€™t keen to try something my mother enjoyed (remember that trick, parents). I remind my daughter that whenever the day comes that she wants to lose her virginity (why is it something you lose, like a precious possession?), it is no oneâ€™s business but hers. If anyone tries to judge her based on her genitals, I tell her to just walk away. I tell her that our vaginas are very special and powerful, we bleed and give birth from them, and itâ€™s her right as a woman to enjoy sex one day. Itâ€™s a beautiful and enjoyable act. Patriarchy tried to prevent me and over 200 million FGM survivors from living as sexual beings, but through therapy and a loving supportive partner many of these women can and are enjoying sex. There is hope. Dear world, women have sex and enjoy it, so get over the idea that virginity is something to protect. Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

              "  \"Brad and Angelina proved there's no such thing as the perfect marriage: so why do we pretend? Pretty much all the cliches of the fairytale (the noble prince, the helpless princess) have long been satirised, in everything from The Princess Bride to Shrek to the Zog books by the brilliant Julia Donaldson. But there is one myth that even the most cynical of humans stubbornly clings to â€“ the promise of â€œhappily ever afterâ€\\x9d, even if all around us is the proof that this is about as likely as a fire-breathing dragon. According to a recent report from the Office for National Statistics, the number of couples in Britain who describe themselves as â€œextremely unhappyâ€\\x9d has doubled in the past five years, while those who describe their relationship as â€œperfectâ€\\x9d has gone down from 9.2% to 5.9%. The ONS does not state how many of those who claimed their relationship was â€œperfectâ€\\x9d in previous studies are now saying they are â€œextremely unhappyâ€\\x9d, but Iâ€™d wager there was significant crossover. After all, those who cling to an illusion are the most likely to be disappointed by the reality. This summer has proffered plenty of evidence of the death of this myth. From Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love, and her husband, some of the most loudly self-proclaimed happy relationships have come to an end. When a high-profile marriage ends, the journalistic cliche is to say that the reason fans feel unnerved is because they think that, if the celebrities canâ€™t make it work, who can? This is nonsense. As much as people still desperately want to believe in a happily ever after, only the most naive child would think that buckets of money, the constant glare of attention, and at least one desperately needy and narcissistic person sounds like a recipe for a happy marriage. Frankly, Iâ€™ve always thought it a miracle that any celebrity marriages last. Instead, the shock of a high-profile divorce is that these are the people who, more than anyone, have promoted the myth of happily ever after, through their work and, often, through interviews and romantic photo opportunities. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard met on movies, as did Pitt and Jolie â€“ films that ended with the promise that only happiness awaited their characters after the closing credits. Elizabeth Gilbertâ€™s relationship with Jose Nunes was the basis of her best-known books, from Eat, Pray, Love (made into a predictably slushy Hollywood film) to Committed, her book about her marriage. But in July, Gilbert announced they were divorcing, and that she is now in a relationship with her best friend, who is currently undergoing cancer treatment. Amid the supportive cheers, some of Gilbertâ€™s fans expressed sadness for Nunes, and who can blame them? He had been sold as their symbol of the happily ever after. (By contrast, the most recent celebrities to separate, ZoÃ« Ball and Norman Cook, were always extremely open about their struggles with infidelity, addiction and the general mundanity of marriage. For this reason, the announcement of their split felt to me like the saddest of all.) And yet the myth persists. In her third Bridget Jones book, Mad About The Boy, Helen Fielding famously killed off Mark Darcy, presumably partly because she herself was divorced by this point and somewhat over the happily ever after storyline. (It is often forgotten how sceptical the original book was about marriage, with its satirisation of Smug Marrieds.) But Hollywood would never allow such cynicism: in the latest absurd movie instalment, Bridget Jonesâ€™s Baby, Darcy is firmly resurrected. Do you really need a spoiler alert if I say â€œGuess the ending?â€\\x9d The best books I have read recently are the ones that resist the simplistic love-cures-all conclusions. In Jessi Kleinâ€™s terrific collection of essays, Youâ€™ll Grow Out Of It, she continues the story after her wedding, describing her fertility struggles and the toll this took on her relationship. Rachel Dratchâ€™s memoir, Girl Walks Into A Bar, is a fascinating riposte to the upbeat â€œyou go girl!â€\\x9d female memoir cliche, detailing not just her diminishing professional success but an honest account of what itâ€™s like to be single in your mid-40s. On screen, Desiree Akhavanâ€™s Appropriate Behavior has proved it is possible to make a delightfully optimistic romcom that begins and ends with a breakup. I never liked Elizabeth Gilbertâ€™s gratingly simplistic memoirs, but her last novel, The Signature Of All Things, is astonishingly brilliant: big-hearted and beady-eyed, it looks at how the romantic fantasy can corrode a womanâ€™s imagination and blind her to reality. Most of all, it knows that happy endings come in all guises, not just with a bridal veil.\",\n",
              "  'Google, Facebook and Microsoft race to get 1 billion Indians online When Manish Kumar first came to the village of Harisal in western India in July, he didnâ€™t think he could stay there for very long. â€œIt was monsoon, so it was difficult to reach because the roads were bad. There was no phone signal, and the electricity only comes on for a few hours in the evening. The people there are farmers, so they wake up early. They work all day, and then in the evening they eat dinner before dark. And then they go to sleep. Thereâ€™s nothing else to do.â€\\x9d But the typical agricultural setting of Harisal was about to change. Kumar, the network head of a rural internet provider AirJaldi had come to transform it into Indiaâ€™s first digital village, under a scheme backed by the Indian government and software giant Microsoft. â€œWe set up a Wi-Fi tower and three smaller hotspots. At first, people were struggling to get online, they didnâ€™t know how to sign on, and we had to teach them. Now, when I visit the village, the kids come to us and teach us how to get the internet working.â€\\x9d About 2,000 villagers live in Harisal. There are only five or six laptops in the village, but almost every household has a smartphone. For them, the new Wi-Fi connection changed their lives overnight. â€œWe finally feel connected to the rest of the world,â€\\x9d says Jagdishkumar Someshwar Sirsat, the headmaster of the village school. â€œItâ€™s made small tasks easier. For example, we had to give attendance records to the state government. Before, someone would have to hand deliver those to the government office in the city. Now, we can just fill out a form online, and its done,â€\\x9d he says. â€œAnd for the children â€“ sometimes the textbooks donâ€™t have enough information, or some things are not up to date. Now that they have internet, they can go online and look up whatever theyâ€™re interested in. For the older kids, weâ€™re using online tutorials on YouTube and educational video blogs to teach them new things. They love it.â€\\x9d Sheetal Thorat, a doctor in Harisal, says internet connections could save lives. â€œIn the village, there are no specialists for the heart or brain. Thereâ€™s just me and two other field doctors for the whole village, and weâ€™re general practitioners. Now that we have Wi-Fi, we can set up consultations with heart or brain specialists in Mumbai, and then they can send back reports online.â€\\x9d Microsoft funded the project, and plans to get 50 more villages around Harisal online. Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman of Microsoft India, says its project to get villages online is philanthropic. â€œWe donâ€™t have any commercial interest in these projects. We want telecom and other service providers to use the connectivity to provide citizens with useful services,â€\\x9d he says. Microsoft has also previously said it would be good for its own business if more people were online. Google and Facebook join online push Microsoft is not alone in the race to get India online. Google has launched a scheme to provide free public Wi-Fi at 100 railway stations. About 3.5m users have already connected to Googleâ€™s station Wi-Fi service, with an estimated 15,000 people coming online for the first time every day thanks to the scheme. â€œWe want to expand to new venues, like cafes and malls, to help more people get online, and weâ€™re looking for strategic and forwarding-thinking partners to work with on this effort,â€\\x9d says Caeser Sengupta, vice-president of Googleâ€™s â€œNext Billion Usersâ€\\x9d team. Last year, Facebook tried to launch Free Basics, which would have allowed people in rural India free access to websites chosen by the company, but the plan was blocked after millions wrote to the telecoms authority saying the scheme would give Facebook too much power. Now, the company has come up with a new scheme, Express Wi-Fi, which will allow those in rural India to buy fast, cheap and reliable mobile data packs. Indiaâ€™s rapidly developing economy, and increasing smartphone penetration presents a huge opportunity for tech firms, who are looking for new markets to expand their products and services, as growth in western economies slows. According to the World Bankâ€™s latest figures, 26% of Indiaâ€™s 1.25 billion population has internet access. In 2014â€“15, 60 million, equivalent to the entire UK population, went online for the first time. About 900 million people in India, mostly in rural areas, are offline. â€œIndia is the only major economy in the world that had a year-on-year growth in internet and smartphone users,â€\\x9d says Vikas Kothari, tech analyst at venture capital firm Lightbox. â€œLarge players like Google, Facebook and Microsoft are looking for their next set of billion users and India looks the most promising.â€\\x9d Internet access could transform economy Facebook has not yet released details of how much profit it expects to make from its Express Wi-Fi service, or how much investment will be needed to subsidise rural data access, but the company says that internet access will benefit everybody. â€œInternet access means opportunity. It enables progress. It improves knowledge, economies, lives and communities,â€\\x9d says a Facebook spokesperson. The tech companies may appear benevolent, but Kothari says they will all benefit if Indiaâ€™s internet accessibility increases. â€œIn a [digital] ecosystem when infrastructure improves, the biggest beneficiaries are the large players,â€\\x9d he explains. Kothari says the tech giants see India as a long-term investment. â€œThe most visited sites or apps in India are Google Search, Play Store, YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook. Google and Facebookâ€™s business models donâ€™t depend on a fee, but on user data. If more people use their products, the more data they get, thus increasing their ad revenues.â€\\x9d For India, better internet infrastructure could transform the economy, and the lives of ordinary citizens. â€œImproved connectivity will further democratise access to education, healthcare and financial services. People in remote areas will get access to skill-development courses, tertiary telemedicine and reports on agriculture and commodity prices, thus improving their lives,â€\\x9d says Kothari.',\n",
              "  'Liverpool 2-2 Newcastle United: Premier League â€“ as it happened Thatâ€™s all for now! Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back later for a full match report from Anfield. Hereâ€™s a game where the substitutions changed everything. Liverpool let their foot off the glass briefly and it came back to bite them. Not that Newcastle will turn down the gifted point, which they desperately need in their relegation battle. 90 min+3: One last chance for Liverpool as Lovren moves quickly up the middle of the pitch and plays it forward. It goes out for an apparent corner but before it can be awarded, the referee blows the whistle for full time. 90 min: Entering the final stages Newcastle seem on track for the most improbable of points. Three minutes of stoppage time forthcoming. 87 min: Ojo surges up the right side and pulls it back to Coutinho at the top of the area but his one-time shot is saved. Liverpool will have a corner. 83 min: Two more subs. For Liverpool, Ojo enters for the goal-scorer Lallana. For Newcastle, itâ€™s the former LFC midfielder Jonjo Shelvey on for Cheik Tiote. 81 min: Liverpool work it up the right flank again and the ball is sent into Sturridge, who heads it weakly toward the goal where the keeper easily scoops it in. 80 min: The corner is turned away but Liverpool have another chance when the ball falls to Stewart, but his one-time shot sailed high and wide over the goal. 78 min: Weâ€™re into the final quarter hour and Liverpool have a corner after Lallana surges toward the goal and itâ€™s pushed out by a defender. 75 min: Benitez with Newcastleâ€™s second switch: Cisse off for Mitrovic. 71 min: Two subs for Liverpool. Lucas and Coutinho entering for Randall and Allen. Milner will shift to right back. Newcastle counter after Sturridge loses possession and Jack Colback rips a shot thatâ€™s deflected past Mignolet into the goal. As @thisisanfield notes, itâ€™s the second time Liverpool have surrendered a two-goal advantage against the team from the Northeast this year. 62 min: Another Liverpool corner is turned away. Good counter-attack by Newcastle and the ball is out for a corner. Itâ€™s played short and sent into the area, but Stewart meets it in the air and heads it away. 60 min: One hour down and Liverpool appear to have regained their footing after going on walkabout for the first five minutes of the half. 59 min: Milnerâ€™s service into the area is headed into the back of the net by Allen but Firmino is ruled offside. It was close but replay confirms he was off by half a yard. 56 min: Moments after Milner is show yellow for a clattering challenge, he wins a free kick from just near the corner flag. He sends it into the Newcastle area but itâ€™s easily cleared. 52 min: Sturridge tripped inside the area and appeals for the penalty, but while heâ€™s still on the ground Newcastle are countering brilliant. Itâ€™s Cisse by himself on the edge of the area but he takes one touch too many, Liverpoolâ€™s defenders close in and somehow they escape it. It really should be 2-2! And Newcastle start the second half with the spark and verve they showed to end the first. A long cross from Anita toward the back post is headed home by Cisse and the Toon are back in business! 46 min: Newcastle have made one change at half-time: Ayoze Perez exits for Georginio Wijnaldum. Speaking of, Uefa have issued a statement on Sakho. UEFA would like to confirm the information communicated by Liverpool FC regarding an adverse finding in a doping test of their player Mamadou Sakho conducted at the UEFA Europa League match between Manchester United FC and Liverpool FC on 17 March 2016 (1-1). The player and the club have received all the pertinent information and have until Tuesday to request the analysis of the B ssample as well as to provide explanations for the presence of a prohibited substance in the playersâ€™ body. There are no disciplinary proceedings opened at this stage. Look whoâ€™s been spotted at Anfield. A comfortable opening half for the Reds, who answered the bell nicely with an early goal from Sturridge and Lallanaâ€™s follow-up. 44 min: Another shot for Anita, one that sails high and wide over the goal, but no doubt Newcastleâ€™s strongest patch today. 41 min: Signs of life from Newcastle as Anita is played through up the right side and sends it into Cisse, whose header is thudded just wide of the goal 37 min: A note from JR in Illinois, via email: I canâ€™t quite believe that nobody (save for a very brief mention by announcer Gary Weaver) seemed to notice the incident about 30 seconds before Sturridge scored. I went back and watched it several times. Mignolet came out of his goal to punch the ball. Not only does it clearly look like the ball was outside the box but Mignolet also cleaned Perezâ€™s clock. Looked an awful lot like two yellow card offences. Weird. Must confess I missed it myself. Will review at the half. 36 min: Another chance for Liverpool as Firmino surges up the right flank and sends it into the area. It appears to be handled by a defender but appeals for a penalty go unacknowledged by the referee. 35 min: Firmino nearly makes it 3-0 on a point-blank chance from inside the area, but a last-gasp challenge by the center back interrupts. 33 min: Tiote, already on a yellow, throws down Joe Allen near the touch line and appears to be a red card waiting to happen. Almost looks like he wants to get sent off. Lallana sends a beautifully struck left-footed curler into the top-left corner of the goal. Made it look so easy. A special goal. Moreno again with the assist. 23 min: Newcastle barely showing a pulse at the moment. A punchless performance so far to be sure. They enter todayâ€™s match on a run of nine straight away defeats. The club record is 10, set back in the 1930s, so history may be afoot. 21 min: Newcastle win a corner and itâ€™s quickly cleared. Tiote shown yellow for a cynical foul on Lallana as the midfielder tries to key a Liverpool counter-attack. 20 min: More great interplay from Liverpool up the right flank. Theyâ€™re really in fine form at the moment. 18 min: A ball is played through to Sturridge, whose quickly struck left-footed shot toward the upper-right corner of the goal just misses the mark. 16 min: Liverpool threatening again as the ball caroms off a series of defenders in the area. Firmino finally directs a shot toward the goal, but itâ€™s turned away. 14 min: Liverpoolâ€™s center back Dejan Lovren is down and the medical staff are out to treat him. Heâ€™s sitting up now and Martin Skrtel has sprung from the bench to loosen up, but it looks as if Lovren will re-enter the match. 11 min: Liverpool threatening again after a bit of a rudderless stretch in the middle third. Itâ€™s Lallana evading defenders on the edge of the area trying to pick out Sturridge but his pass misses the target. 8 min: The referee stops play as Moreno is down with an injury. 5 min: What a start for Liverpool. The Kop faithful had yet to even finish their first-minute tribute to Benitez â€“ you can probably guess the song â€“ when Sturridge found the back of the goal for his fourth goal in five matches (and seventh in 11 career matches against Newcastle). 4 min: Newcastle win a corner but nothing comes of it and within moments Liverpool move it down the pitch into the final third and are threatening again. The match is a scant 68 seconds old when Sturridge times his run perfectly, traps a long pass from the halfway line, clinically spins around two defenders and thumps it past the keeper into the back of the goal. A dream start for the hosts. 1 min: And weâ€™re off! Liverpool attacking left to right toward the Kop end in all-red strips, Newcastle from right to left. Some thoughts Liverpoolâ€™s manager in todayâ€™s match programme. Hello and welcome to todayâ€™s Premier League tie between Liverpool and Newcastle. The Toon are locked in a relegation battle and currently within two points of safety after a mid-week draw with Manchester City. A win today would lift them out of the drop zone, but three points could prove a tall order against a surging Liverpool side on a run of four straight wins across all competitions, most recently a 4-0 triumph over Merseyside rivals Everton on Wednesday. With about a half hour between now and kickoff, hereâ€™s a look at todayâ€™s teams. Liverpool XI: Mignolet, Randall, Toure, Lovren, Moreno, Stewart, Allen, Milner, Lallana, Firmino, Sturridge Subs: Ward, Skrtel, Smith, Lucas, Coutinho, Ibe, Ojo Newcastle XI: Darlow, Anita, Lascelles, Mbemba, Dummett, Townsend, Tiote, Colback, Sissoko, Perez, Cisse Subs: Woodman, Mbabu, Shelvey, Wijnaldum, Aarons, De Jong, Mitrovic Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime why not check out Andy Hunterâ€™s preview of todayâ€™s match. Rafael BenÃ\\xadtezâ€™s return to Anfield as the interim manager of Chelsea in 2013 was overshadowed somewhat by Luis SuÃ¡rezâ€™s bite on Branislav Ivanovic. He heads back seeking a favour from his old club in his attempt to keep Newcastle in the Premier League, but Liverpool are not in the form to give one â€“ regardless of what team JÃ¼rgen Klopp selects. With Villarreal in the Europa League semi-finals to come next week, Klopp may revert to the much-changed lineup that beat Bournemouth last Sunday. But thereâ€™s also been big news from Anfield already â€¦',\n",
              "  'Labor push for banking royal commission shut down by government Labor has moved a motion to introduce a banking royal commission in an attempt to derail the governmentâ€™s agenda on the first substantive day of parliament since the election. But the government has shut the move down, pointing to a new inquiry into small business lending practices and other reforms to argue the royal commission is not needed. Bill Shorten, the opposition leader, on Wednesday sought a suspension of standing orders in the lower house to call for a royal commission. The motion was seconded by independent MP Bob Katter. Shorten said that scandals in the banking and financial services industry have gutted retireesâ€™ savings, â€œrortedâ€\\x9d families and resulted in life insurance policy holders being denied justice. He cited examples including allegations of rate-fixing in the banking sector and insurance policies being denied for â€œhaving the wrong type of heart attackâ€\\x9d. â€œDespite several inquiries, new powers, new resources, and a financial ombudsman service, the rorts and the rip offs continue.â€\\x9d Kelly Oâ€™Dwyer, the minister for revenue and financial services, announced on Wednesday the government has asked the Australian small business and family enterprise ombudsman to look at how banks treat their small business lending customers. The ombudsman will report within 12 weeks and provide interim findings to the Ramsay review examining external dispute resolution schemes in the financial services sector. The government shut down Laborâ€™s call for a royal commission, successfully amending the motion to instead question why Labor had not instituted an inquiry when it was in government. Coalition MP George Christensen, formerly an advocate for a bank royal commission, moved the motion. He noted the Ramsay review â€“ led by corporate law expert Professor Ian Ramsay â€“ was under way and that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission had commenced prosecutions on the rate-rigging allegations. Christensen pointed to government initiatives including increasing the resources of Asic and a new process to haul banks before a parliamentary committee to explain failing to pass on interest rate cuts. â€œIf a royal commission were to go ahead it would simply be reviewing old ground,â€\\x9d he said. The leader of the opposition proposed areas of focus for the commission, including consideration of how widespread unethical behaviour is, financial institutionsâ€™ duty of care, and whether regulators are equipped to prevent illegal and unethical behaviour. Shorten said the breadth and scope of the allegations showed problems in the industry â€œgo beyond any one bank, type of financial institution or group of receiversâ€\\x9d. He accused the government of running a â€œprotection racketâ€\\x9d by refusing opposition demands for a royal commission. â€œYou can take Malcolm Turnbull out of the investment bank, but you canâ€™t take the investment banker out of Malcolm Turnbull,â€\\x9d he said, referring to the prime ministerâ€™s former career in finance. Shorten said Labor, the Greens, crossbench, and at least eight Liberal and National parliamentarians had supported a royal commission. But the appetite for a royal commission is waning amongst some of those Coalition MPs, with Warren Entsch, previously a fierce advocate, now proposing a bank victim compensation tribunal instead. On 16 August Katter blasted Entsch for the back-flip, accusing him of â€œdogging itâ€\\x9d and pleading with him to back a royal commission. Shorten said a royal commission â€œis the only forum with the coercive powers and broad jurisdiction necessary to properly perform this investigationâ€\\x9d. He invited Turnbull to meet with the victims of banking and financial scandals.',\n",
              "  'Southampton 0-2 Chelsea: Premier League â€“ as it happened Hereâ€™s Dominic Fifieldâ€™s match report: That was an extremely impressive performance from Chelsea, perhaps their best of the season. Their defence didnâ€™t give Southampton a sniff, and Eden Hazard and Diego Costa were full of menace on the break. Since moving to a back three they have won four league games in a row by a combined score of 11-0. They are less adventurous than the three sides above them but they look dangerous and durable. Thanks for your company, night. 89 min Diego Costa is replaced by Michy Batshuayi. He had a terrific game. 87 min Chelsea bring on Branislav Ivanovic for the impressive Victor Moses. 85 min Austin has a goal disallowed for offside after robbing David Luiz. It was the right decision, though it was extremely close. 84 min Another excellent Chelsea attack. Costa curls a long pass to the wing-back Moses on the right. He runs across the line of the box, uses Willian by not using him and belts a left-footed shot that is too hot for Forster to hold. 81 min A summary of this match. 78 min Substitutions galore. Chelsea introduce Willian for Pedro; Southampton bring on Sam McQueen and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg for Dusan Tadic and Ryan Bertrand. 76 min Southampton almost pulled one back. Martinaâ€™s curling cross was met at the near post by Davis, who headed it onto the challenging David Luiz. From there it looped over Courtois and onto the top of the bar. 74 min Chelsea have been brilliant in the second half. Before half-time they were excellent defensively but offered almost nothing going forward. Since the break they could have scored four or five. 71 min Hazard almost repeats his goal against Manchester United last week. He ran at Martina on the left of the box, moved the ball infield and drove it low across goal. It wasnâ€™t quite in the corner, however, and Forster got down smartly to his left to save. 69 min Bertrand breaks down the left and wafts a nice cross towards Austin, who gets above Cahill on the six-yard line but thumps his header over the bar. That was Southamptonâ€™s best chance of the match. 68 min Southampton have only had one shot on target, Tadicâ€™s free-kick in the first half. That tells you how well Chelsea have defended. 67 min This game is done. Chelsea are in full catenaccio mode and Southampton have no answer. 63 min How did that stay out? Mosesâ€™s shot was spilled by Forster to Hazard, who calmly squared it across the six-yard line for Costa. Forster was out of the game but there was a defender on the line and Costa, for some reason, tried to give the goal to Pedro. His pass was slightly behind Pedro, who was eventually crowded out by the defence. It was lovely play from Hazard, reminiscent of Karel Poborskyâ€™s brilliant assist for Vladimir Smicer in the 3-2 win over the Netherlands at Euro 2004. 61 min Southampton make their first change, with Clasie replaced by Sofiane Boufal. 58 min Almost a third goal for Chelsea. Hazardâ€™s low cross to the near post is swept over the bar by Costa, who was under pressure from the sliding Fonte on the six-yard line. 57 min This has been an immaculate away performance from Chelsea. Itâ€™s hard to believe itâ€™s just over a month since they were a mess at Arsenal. This is a wonderful goal from Diego Costa! Chelsea took a short free-kick on the left, where Hazard gave the ball to Costa. He moved infield and them, just from just outside the box, smacked a magnificent curling shot into the far corner. Brilliant. He was helped by some half-arsed defending from Martina, who couldnâ€™t be bothered to close him down properly, but it was still a fantastic goal. 55 min Chelsea look very comfortable defensively, and a bit more purposeful in attack than they were in the first half. This is their best spell of the game. 52 min Chelsea counter-attack promisingly until Alonso picks the wrong option, a shot from 25 yards, and executes it dismally. 50 min Matic heads the corner over the bar. 49 min Fonte saves a goal with a crucial interception. Kante drove a crossfield pass to Alonso, who delivered a beautiful low cross along the six-yard line. Fonte, sliding towards his own goal, knew he had to do something because Hazard was behind him waiting to score, and he just managed to slice it wide of the far post from a corner. 48 min Southampton have some decent attacking options on the bench, including Boufal, McQueen and Hojbjerg. I suspect theyâ€™re going to need them. 46 min Southampton kick off from left to right. Peep peep! Half-time reading Peep peep! Chelsea have done an efficient number on Southampton, scoring early through Eden Hazard and defend in the Serie A style. Southampton have not played badly at all but they are really struggling to add the progression to their possession. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45+1 min Southampton appeal for a penalty when Austin goes over after an aerial challenge with Kante. There was nothing in that. 44 min â€œShearer last night said that Aguero is the only world-class player in the Premiership,â€\\x9d says Ian Copestake. â€œGiven there are only about five world class players in the actual world then perhaps his comment has no actual shock value.â€\\x9d 43 min Austin does exceedingly well, Mr Kipling, to win a corner for Southampton. Bugger all happens from the corner, however, so he neednâ€™t have bothered. 41 min Matic robs Clasie and plays a gentle through pass for Costa. He lumbers into the box and whacks a low shot that is kicked away by Forster. Thatâ€™s a crucial save because you canâ€™t see Southampton coming back from 2-0 down against this defence. 38 min Good play from Hazard, who veers away from Van Dijk and Romeu 20 yards from goal before hitting a low curling shot that is comfortably saved by Forster. 33 min A desperate clearance from David Luiz finds Hazard on the left. He has a great chance to put Pedro through on goal but mishits his crossfield pass. Eventually it comes to Moses, whose shot deflects wide for a corner. 31 min This is almost like a training session, with Southampton attacking and Chelsea defending. Chelsea look superbly organised at the back and Southampton canâ€™t make any progress. 27 min Alonso shoves Tadic over 25 yards from goal. Heâ€™s been the weakest of Chelseaâ€™s back seven thus far. The free-kick is a far way to the right of centre, and Chelsea only have a three-man wall. Tadic curls it low around that wall and Courtois plunges to his left to palm it round. 23 min Tadic started the match superbly but hasnâ€™t been involved much in the last 10 minutes. For all their nice passing, Southampton havenâ€™t really got behind Chelsea. 21 min Davisâ€™s corner from the left is headed back to him by Cahill. He lobs another cross beyond the far post, where the under-pressure Fonte canâ€™t direct his header on target. 20 min Hazard looks menacing every time he gets the ball. After missing almost all of last season through apathy, he is fit and firing again. 17 min â€œIâ€™m glad to see Chelsea finally showing signs of change after playing in a similar way regardless of manager,â€\\x9d says Nas Iqbal. â€œConteâ€™s trust in Luiz and Moses is reaping big rewards right now.â€\\x9d They look formidable defensively now, with three centre-backs and Kante and Matic in front of them. Good luck getting through that mob. 16 min Southampton win a corner on the left, play it short and make a balls of it. 14 min Davisâ€™s inswinging free-kick from a narrow position to the left is headed well wide by Austin, lurking near the penalty spot. That was a decent chance but he got far too much on the header. 13 min Southampton have responded well to going behind, with some confident, easy passing. 9 min â€œI still have not quite recovered from the cricket this morning, me not being the type to be glad of a loss despite the incessant practice,â€\\x9d says Ian Copestake. â€œSo I hope Southampton can build a good lead before tea.â€\\x9d 8 min This has been a cracking start to the match, and Redmond almost slithers through the Chelsea defence at the other end. He would have done so but for that pesky Matic, who made an excellent interception. 7 min As Gary Neville says on Sky, â€œonce youâ€™re one against one with Hazard in the box, youâ€™re deadâ€\\x9d. He beat Davis easily and then cracked the shot through Forster. Chelsea take the lead! Itâ€™s a classy goal from Hazard, who is starting to look back to his best. He moseyed over to the right side of the box to receive a return pass from Moses, turned inside Davis and belted a low left-footed shot through the legs of Forster. 5 min Tadic picks up a loose ball on the edge of the box and hits a shot that is well blocked by Matic. Moments later, after Tadic makes a fool of Alonso, Romeu hooks a bouncing ball over the bar from 30 yards. 3 min â€œOkay Rob,â€\\x9d says Matt Loten, â€œfirst poser of the afternoon for you: what is Pedro doing right to keep Chelseaâ€™s best player of last season, Willian, on the bench? Donâ€™t get me wrong, the Spaniard has plenty of qualities - you donâ€™t play in that Barcelona team without qualities - but to my mind Willian is a far more consistent threat, and better at playing the ball between the lines. His free kicks arenâ€™t half bad either. Is Conte just sticking with a winning team, or is Pedro really the better choice?â€\\x9d Willian is probably a better player but Iâ€™d say Pedro suits the 3-4-3 system a bit better. Also, Pedro was superb last week so Iâ€™m sure there is an element of not changing a winning side. I canâ€™t see Willian being on the bench for long, especially as you could play him in a few positions. 2 min Hazard makes a good angled run to the right of the box before crossing towards Costa at the near post. His attempted shot is blocked by a defender and dribbles through to Forster. 1 min Peep peep! Chelsea kick off from left to right. Theyâ€™re in blue; Southampton are wearing the usual red-and-white stripes. The players emerge from the tunnel into the cool Southampton air. The weatherâ€™s nice. A little brisk. Everton beat West Ham 2-0 in the first match of the day. You can read all about it here. Southampton (4-D-2) Forster; Martina, Fonte, Van Dijk, Bertrand; Romeu, Davis, Clasie; Tadic; Redmond, Austin. Substitutes: Taylor, McQueen, Yoshida, Hojbjerg, Ward-Browse, Boufal, Olomola. Chelsea (3-4-3) Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso; Pedro, Costa, Hazard. Substitutes: Begovic, Ivanovic, Terry, Chalobah, Oscar, Willian, Batshuayi. Referee Mike Jones Chelsea are the team of the season so far. No, you big eejit, I donâ€™t mean theyâ€™ve been the best team, but they are the team who best reflect the old-fashioned unpredictability of the 2016-17 Premier League season. In the first few weeks, when they picked up all those points through late goals, they were apparently the likeliest challengers to the Manchester clubs. Then they were an in-transition shambles who even lost to Arsenal. Now, after Antonio Conteâ€™s switch to three at the back, they are apparently the likeliest challengers to Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool. William Goldman was right: nobody knows anything. So we might as well just enjoy what looks like a cracking game between Chelsea and the always admirable Southampton. Chelsea are the only team to win a league match at St Maryâ€™s this year, a reflection of how tricky a match this is likely to be. A win for Chelsea would take them within a point of the top three; a win for Southampton would take them above Manchester United. Kick off is at 4pm. Rob will be here soon enough. Until then, read Antonio Conteâ€™s thoughts on fruit and varying formations: Under Antonio Conte Chelseaâ€™s stomachs are settling. It has been a fraught 12 months but three Premier League wins of increasing significance have brought a pronounced change in tone and the managerâ€™s tweaks, both on and off the pitch, appear to have swiftly borne fruit. In fact fruit is only part of it. Conteâ€™s reputation for keeping firm control over his playersâ€™ diets preceded his arrival in July and, in relaxed form at Cobham before Sundayâ€™s visit to Southampton, he explained that his insistence on balanced food intake stems from a penny dropping late in his playing career.',\n",
              "  \"Martin Baron: 'We took Donald Trump seriously from the beginning' The phone call that would, just hours later, inflict a highly damaging blow to Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential ambitions came through to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold mid-morning on Friday 7 October. The source â€“ a Snapchat-era â€œDeep Throatâ€\\x9d â€“ informed Fahrenthold, whose dogged exposure of the operations of the Trump Foundation had so infuriated the billionaire, that they had some previously unaired video of Trump. Would he be interested in viewing it? â€œDavid recognised immediately that [the footage] was explosive,â€\\x9d says the Postâ€™s executive editor Martin Baron, â€œand the first task was to make sure it was authenticated, which he was able to do pretty quickly.â€\\x9d The Post sent a transcript of the video â€“ outtakes from a 2005 edition of the NBC show Access Hollywood, in which Trump is heard bragging that â€œwhen youâ€™re a star â€¦ you can do anything [to women] â€¦ grab them by the pussyâ€\\x9d â€“ to the Trump campaign for comment. â€œThey asked us for the actual video,â€\\x9d says the softly-spoken Baron, â€œand shortly after that they sent us Donald Trumpâ€™s initial response.â€\\x9d Five hours on from the tip-off, the video and accompanying piece went live on the Post, reverberating around the world. While Grope-gate (as some are inevitably calling it) may be a far cry from Watergate, the Postâ€™s most famous scoop, it was nevertheless a momentum-shifting event in the presidential race, which has seen Trump, who had previously claimed that he could â€œshoot somebodyâ€\\x9d on Manhattanâ€™s Fifth Avenue and not lose votes, since struggle to regain his swagger. Yet, while the Trump revelations have lately flowed thick and fast, there has been criticism (even in the Post) that much of the US media was initially slow to take Trump seriously, particularly early on in the Republican primaries. Baron vigorously defends his corner. â€œAt the Post, we took the candidacy seriously from the very beginning,â€\\x9d he insists, going on to cite reporting, among other things, on Trump Mortgage, the Trump University, and his â€œmultiple bankruptcies in Atlantic Cityâ€\\x9d. â€œOther people reacted in a different way. Certainly there was a tremendous amount of cable coverage of his rallies,â€\\x9d he says. â€œWall-to-wall, they would cover his rallies from beginning to end, on live television. I donâ€™t happen to think that was a wise decision on their part.â€\\x9d Baron does concede, however, that Trump is â€œskilfulâ€\\x9d at using the media. â€œ[During the primaries] he would call into shows, which would normally require a candidate to show up in person, they would just take his phone call and heâ€™d be on the air, and then heâ€™d call the next show. Heâ€™s been by far the most accessible presidential candidate ever.â€\\x9d Indeed, even when the Trump campaign barred the Postâ€™s reporters from his events (for, they claimed, inaccurate reporting), he still made himself available to Baronâ€™s team. â€œWe had actual published interviews with him, [even] while we were on the blacklist,â€\\x9d he says. Born in 1954 and raised in Tampa, Florida, Baron, whoâ€™s a fluent Spanish speaker, cut his teeth at the Miami Herald, which he first joined in 1976. He went on to work at some of Americaâ€™s most prestigious titles â€“ the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. As Globe editor, the paper won six Pulitzer prizes, including in 2003 for the Spotlight teamâ€™s investigation into sexual abuse by Catholic priests, which was turned into the Oscar-winning movie Spotlight last year. In 2013, he became executive editor of the Post, which a little over three years ago was acquired by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for $250m from the Graham family. Earlier this year, the Post â€“ whose traffic numbers reached a record 83.1m unique visitors in September 2016, a 40% year-on-year increase â€“ moved from its former base to a gleaming, light-filled building on K Street, where reporters sit cheek-by-jowl with software engineers. Beyond financial capital, the Amazon CEO has provided the Post with â€œintellectual capital, tooâ€\\x9d, Baron explains. â€œHeâ€™s basically forced us to confront how the internet is different and how we have to adapt to it and embrace it. Heâ€™s also given us what he calls â€˜runwayâ€™, which is time to experiment. So, in funding the experiments, we have time to let them play out, without having to adhere to some strict timeline or strict requirements for profit.â€\\x9d One area Bezos was especially keen that Baron address was the issue of aggregation. â€œOne of the first questions he asked was: â€˜You do these long narratives, these deep investigations, but after youâ€™re published, within 15 minutes, half a dozen websites have decided to aggregate you â€“ and they get more traffic than you do. How do you propose to deal with that?â€™â€\\x9d Baronâ€™s solution was, in effect, to fight fire with fire; hiring in-house bloggers, not only did the Post start aggregating itself, but it began aggregating other peopleâ€™s content too. Since acquiring the Post, Bezos â€“ whoâ€™s added 140 employees in three years â€“ has held regular conference calls with senior staff. So how interested is he in the editorial side of the paper? The question isnâ€™t even complete before Baron jumps in: â€œHe doesnâ€™t inject himself at all into our journalism. He doesnâ€™t suggest stories for us to do. He doesnâ€™t critique us in any way. Every once in a while, when he sees a story which delights him, he tells us. â€œ[The conference calls] are all about tactics and strategy. We talked about aggregation, way back when. Weâ€™ve talked about our audience engagement team. But in terms of particular stories, particular projects, or particular avenues of coverage, he does not get involved at all.â€\\x9d When asked what he thinks the Postâ€™s output and business model will look like in five years time, Baron concedes that he simply doesnâ€™t know. â€œI always say the people who are most certain about what the model will be are the furthest removed from any responsibility for actually making that model occur,â€\\x9d he says a touch world-wearily. â€œThereâ€™s so much thatâ€™s happened so fast, and the pace of change has really accelerated. Today weâ€™re sitting here talking about what we are doing for Facebook Live. Or what weâ€™re doing for Snapchat. Weâ€™re talking about using bots for Amazon Echo, which we did to provide scores during the Olympics. And during this election weâ€™ll be [using bots] to provide election results. [These arenâ€™t] things we talked about a year ago â€“ maybe we should have, but we didnâ€™t.â€\\x9d Despite his ink-stained background, Baron believes that if institutions such as the Post are to survive, they have to think and behave like technology companies: they need to move fast, take risks, and accept that failure is an essential part of experimentation. â€œI think people [at the Post] do feel free to propose new ideas and try new things,â€\\x9d he says. â€œAnd thereâ€™s no penalty for failing. If it doesnâ€™t work, it doesnâ€™t work.â€\\x9d But, he adds quickly, newspapers must always stick to their principles and values. â€œWe can never violate that. If we do, then we destroy our entire argument for existence.â€\\x9d CV Age: 62 Education: Lehigh University, Pennsylvania. BA Journalism 1972-1976; MBA 1975-1976.

              "  '2016 is make or break time for the NHS â€œItâ€™s a new year, itâ€™s a new dawn, itâ€™s a new life for me and Iâ€™m feeling good,â€\\x9d to misquote Nina Simone. But sadly not everyone starts the new year with optimism. For the NHS, 2016 really does appear to be make or break time. The NHS is in a financial maelstrom â€“ more than three-quarters of all providers are in deficit, amounting to a whopping Â£1.6bn just halfway through the financial year. Last yearâ€™s spending review provided upfront funding for the NHS in 2016-17, but this is short lived. As the chart below shows, NHS funding per person will grow in 2016-17 but that is followed by a year of no real-terms growth and then falling spending for two years. Overall, the settlement for the next five years delivers the same real terms growth in funding as we saw over the last parliament. After inflation it amounts to a 0.9% a year increase in the total NHS budget, which is a O.1% a year increase in health service funding per head. That means we are halfway through a decade of stagnant real-terms spending per person in England. And at this mid-point things are not looking good. Many in the NHS must be hoping that the tight financial squeeze expected later in this parliament is not really the governmentâ€™s plan, and that the Treasury will be reopening the health service spending settlement in a year or two. The political argument would be that health is simply too important to be allowed to fail. Just as the government has in effect provided a bailout for the service in the spending review, so it will do the same in a couple of yearsâ€™ time. And anyway, isnâ€™t the chancellor being too pessimistic and money can always be found? Taking account of the economic outlook Since the autumn, the economic outlook in the UK and globally has worsened, and delivering the economic and fiscal forecasts in the autumn statement looks tough. This is likely to stiffen the Treasuryâ€™s resolve that the anticipated overspend in 2015-16 is not going to be funded by another raid on its fragile coffers but will come out of the extra cash earmarked for 2016-17. This extra funding is going to have to stretch a long way â€“ filing the existing financial black hole, meeting rising pension costs, funding demand pressures and supporting transformation. To rely on the Treasury riding to the rescue is only for those who like very high stakes poker â€“ not really the way to run a vital public service. Against this backdrop, much of health policy looks perplexing. We cannot afford inefficiency or poor productivity. David Nicholson, former chief executive of NHS England, recognised this back in 2009 but progress has been woeful. All too often the focus has been on the one-off, short term and tactical. There has been little drive to address the fundamental barriers to a more efficient and productive service. The Five Year Forward View â€“ Simon Stevensâ€™ plan to make the NHS more sustainable â€“ and Lord Carterâ€™s review of NHS spending, offer hope for a different approach. But 15 months on from the launch of the Forward View, we still donâ€™t have an efficiency plan for the NHS. Beyond the immediate backyard of NHS services the storm clouds are gathering. Delivering a sustainable health service requires action on social care and public health. Evidence suggests that around Â£1 in every Â£5 of NHS spending is the result of ill health attributable to the big five risk factors of smoking, alcohol, poor diet, obesity and inactivity. This, more than anything else, is why we perform so poorly compared with our European neighbours on health outcomes. Despite this, public health budgets are being cut in real terms by almost 4% a year. The gap between the number needing social care support and the number receiving it On social care, the government has recognised that the system canâ€™t sustain a further round of cuts on the scale of the last parliament. Most estimates are that the additional funding for social care wonâ€™t bridge the funding gap. Social care is the dog that hasnâ€™t barked â€“ despite the reductions in access to social care service, demonstrating that this has had a direct impact on the NHS has been difficult. But recent data from the Health Survey for England shows that the lack of robust research evidence on the impact of social care cuts should not be a source of complacency. Providers are reporting that one of the reasons for their rising deficits is delayed transfers of care, partly related to issues of timely access to social care. There are increasing numbers of vulnerable older people living in silent misery with no help. The chart above shows the gap between need and provision (from any source, formal and informal, public and privately funded) for men and women in different income groups. The gap between need and receipt of help is greatest for those on low incomes and growing over time. Whatever the economics of that, it surely cannot be something we aspire to as a society in 2016.

              "  \"Secret Trump voters reverse their support: 'He seems to be insane' Do the outrageous things Donald Trump says â€“ from insinuating Hillary Clinton should be assassinated for her support of gun control to calling on Russia to hack Clintonâ€™s emails â€“ change the minds of people who had planned to vote for him? Yes, actually â€“ at least some of them. In the middle of primary season in February, the called for secret Trump voters to contact us and tell us why they were voting for Trump on the sly. More than 100 reached out â€“ from yoga teachers to immigration lawyers â€“ and we published 12 of those answers. Now that the general election season has well and truly begun, we checked back in with the original anonymous 12 to see if they are still on board the Trump train. We got 10 responses â€“ and four of them have already jumped off. â€œAt first I was seduced by his showmanship and strong-man persona and charisma, and by his strong borders patriotism and willingness to speak about the problem with Islam, and considering banning all Muslims from coming into the USA,â€\\x9d said a 48-year-old scientist from California. â€œBut when he said the judge of Mexican heritage wouldnâ€™t be fair in his lawsuit and women should be punished for having abortions, that really turned me off him,â€\\x9d added the scientist, who had been flipping between Bernie Sanders and Trump but will now vote for Clinton. A retired biomedical engineer from Hawaii, aged 66, says he thought originally that the US needed someone like Trump to create total social upheaval in order to get rid of corruption and paid interests in politics. â€œBut now â€“ fortunately? â€“ Trump has demonstrated that he is much more than a narcissistic buffoon,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAnyone who is willing to put the trigger for Americaâ€™s nuclear weapons in the hands of someone like this is placing the future of human civilization at risk. I believe we must do anything to prevent Trump from ever reaching the Oval Office. Even if it means voting for Hillary Clinton,â€\\x9d added the retired biomedical engineer. A yoga teacher and writer from Tennessee, aged 29, said the bullying antics of Trump didnâ€™t bother him â€“ but that he had stopped supporting him anyway. â€œWhat does bother me is Trumpâ€™s authoritarian tendencies. I believe it would be safe to assume he will grow the American police and surveillance states, which are already spiraling out of control. HRC isnâ€™t any better though. While Trump seems intent on banning Muslims, HRCâ€™s record on foreign policy (and support from war-hawks) reflect she is more likely to bomb them with drones,â€\\x9d he wrote. â€œTruly, I believe America is getting the candidates it deserves. We will not get out of this mess until people wake up and realize they have more than two choices,â€\\x9d said the yoga instructor, noting heâ€™d be voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. Another voter, a white male early retiree who lives in the Sonora desert, said he no longer backs Trump as he â€œseems to be insane. I no longer believe it is possible that he could truly represent the people who support him and need what he promised.â€\\x9d Instead, heâ€™ll reluctantly vote for Clinton. â€œFor me, more Obama is OK, and that is a vote for Clinton. I will rely on the checks and balances of the US constitution to take care of the rest,â€\\x9d he said. But other secret Trump supporters were still backing their initially reticent decision, noting that the news mediaâ€™s coverage of Trump is unfair. â€œThe media is like an extension of the DNC at this point. Theyâ€™ll intentionally misinterpret or exaggerate anything Trump says to try to help Hillary win the election,â€\\x9d said a 50-year-old college professor from California. â€œEveryone wants so desperately to believe heâ€™s Hitler 2.0, and their warped image of him is clearly looming large at the forefront of their minds â€“ so much so that they canâ€™t help but attach the worst possible connotation to even vague, offhand quips like these,â€\\x9d said a 29-year-old Hispanic attorney from Florida, referring to his second amendment comments. An Indian American attorney, who describes his wealth as being in the top 1%, says he doesnâ€™t care about the to-and-fros between Trump and Clinton or even Trump and his own party. â€œAll of the controversies to me are inconsequential. The economy is terrible, the job situation has not materially improved, and illegal immigration and national security will get even worse moving forward. Regardless of what Trump may say and how he gets characterized, his focus is on the right things,â€\\x9d he wrote. But even some who back him donâ€™t agree with all his antics. â€œI do still plan to vote for the orange buffoon. He is a ridiculous egomaniac who has found the recipe for stirring up support among discontented voters,â€\\x9d said a manager from South Carolina. â€œMy only regret is that I wonâ€™t be able to say that I cast a vote for the first woman to ever hold the presidency, but I have little doubt she will win. By the way, my 20-year-old self would be appalled by the complete political cynicism of my 52-year-old self,â€\\x9d he added. A 20-year-old Arab student from Missouri says he backs Trump because heâ€™s flipped US politics. â€œIf he doesnâ€™t win, his ego and legacy will still dominate American politics. He has basically set the tone for the coming century in which an isolated authoritarian state could be a very real prospect for our country,â€\\x9d he said. Did Trump threaten to assassinate Clinton? The also reached out to the 100 secret Trump supporters to get their take on Trumpâ€™s comments this week that gun owners could exercise their second amendment right in protest of Clinton, a line seen by many as a threat of assassination. Hereâ€™s a selection of their responses: A 56-year-old male casino supervisor from Oklahoma: I think and do believe he was talking about taking it to court with the backing of all American gun owners. A 46-year-old male real estate agent from Colorado: Heâ€™s not serious by any means, and youâ€™d be considered mentally ill to act on that delivery â€“ he was trying to be distasteful/politically incorrect as usual, which is why I will vote for the man. PC has ventured into thought policing on things, and along with the ultra surveillance state we have moved towards, I donâ€™t want to be answering questions by the Gestapo after I text a tacky joke to someone. A 26-year-old Chinese citizen working in the US on an H1-B visa: Trump was dumb to say that, but I donâ€™t judge him based on those words. Politicians are trained to not to take things personally, so Hillary shouldnâ€™t care less. Objectively speaking, if Hillary made the decision to be a politician, then dirty attacks are fair game. A 58-year-old retired ornithologist from Tennessee: Hillary is too far left on this issue, the most radical position on gun control of any presidential candidate ever. Sheâ€™s inflamed half of America. A 55-year-old pilot: I am getting tired of Trumpâ€™s running of the mouth. It almost feels like he is trying to lose this election. To me this should be the easiest election to win against this corrupt woman, however Trump is not staying on message and it looks very childish the way he is behaving. Iâ€™m now convinced he will lose unless he turns it around now. A small-business owner from Orlando, Florida: First I heard, I was incredulous. Then I listened â€“ not to the sound bite â€“ but the whole sentence (and I use the term â€˜sentenceâ€™ under advisement due to how he speaks). My take? Just another mountain out of a molehill as created by generally left-leaning media.\",\n",
              "  \"Carrie Fisher in Telluride: 'Iâ€™m just getting bigger and older. That's not good' â€œMother and I live next door to each other, separated by one daunting hill,â€\\x9d says Carrie Fisher in the HBO documentary Bright Lights, which had its North American premiere at the Telluride film festival on Saturday. â€œI usually come to her. I always come to her.â€\\x9d Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevensâ€™s cinema veritÃ©-style film about Fisherâ€™s close relationship with mother Debbie Reynolds will doubtless draw parallels to Albert and David Mayslesâ€™s iconic 1975 documentary Grey Gardens, which centered on a similarly eccentric mother-daughter duo, who shared an equally deep bond. But Fisher likens the film more to a â€œsurreal reality showâ€\\x9d featuring â€œunreal people.â€\\x9d â€œI didnâ€™t think that we were the new Grey Gardens,â€\\x9d Fisher said during a conversation after the screening. â€œItâ€™s really an ideal reality show.â€\\x9d â€œMy mother and I, we used to go shopping â€“ not a lot, because it would turn into a show,â€\\x9d she continued. â€œAnd people would sort of linger because we had loud voices. They would stay in the store to listen us. So [Bright Lights] captures that.â€\\x9d The film finds Reynolds, now in her mid-80s, on the cusp of retirement and planning one last hurrah variety show in Vegas, much to the chagrin of Fisher, who would rather she rest. â€œPerformance feeds her in ways her family cannot,â€\\x9d says Fisher. She meanwhile is documented in the throes of staging her own comeback, preparing to reprise her role as Princess Leia in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. â€œI had always wanted to show my mother off the stage, off the screen, because sheâ€™s such an amazing character,â€\\x9d Fisher said. â€œI wanted someone to capture that.â€\\x9d Despite her wishes, Fisher admitted that she had â€œthird and fifth thoughts about making itâ€\\x9d once Bloom and Stevens came on board, mainly because sheâ€™s not fond of her own appearance on screen. â€œI donâ€™t like looking at myself,â€\\x9d Fisher said. â€œIâ€™m just getting bigger and older. Thatâ€™s not good. Meryl Streep does three movies a year, so she can watch herself age. I went from Princess Leia at 23 in a bikini to this broad. So that was distressing for me. I hate being vain and Iâ€™m working on it â€“ and taking classes.â€\\x9d Bright Lights will air on HBO early next year. It next screens at the New York film festival in October.\",\n",
              "  'From the Land of the Moon review - Marion Cotillard locked up in fuggy sexual melodrama Freedom, as the far left used to say, is the right to choose your jail. School, job, family, marriage: no cage is distraction enough for Gabrielle (Marion Cotillard), who â€“ with a dreamerâ€™s conviction â€“ will do anything to escape the box being built for her. From the Land of the Moon is a choc-cake rich drama that oozes along on the strength of a committed performance from Cotillard and the odd sprinkle of visual flair. It presents a kind of no-frills silliness, almost tricking you into believing its balderdash. Itâ€™s based on Italian author Milena Agusâ€™s 2006 novella, which has been relocated by director Nicole Garcia to 1940s Provence, the French coastal town of La Ciotat, the Swiss alps and Lyon, sometime later in what looks to be the mid-60s. The story is told in flashback from this point. Gabrielle and her husband, JosÃ© (Alex BrendemÃ¼hl) are taking their son to a regional music competition, where â€“ in respect to mamaâ€™s gloomy sensibilities - heâ€™ll mournfully trot out some Tchaikovsky. The mood in the car is peculiar. Mumâ€™s distant, dad and son clearly more connected. They roll into Lyon in a funk. Then Gabrielle spots an address that stirs a violent memory. And from there, weâ€™re off. Sort of. For a fairly simple plot the story rolls out awfully slow. It emerges that Gabrielle, the daughter of a successful lavender farmer, was always the wild child. Stultified by country life, she has channeled her frustrations into a crush on her teacher, partly fuelled by his on-point literary recommendations (Wuthering Heights is, according to teach, â€œAbout a girl who never leaves the countrysideâ€\\x9d). The flirtation ends, disastrously, at a family meal to celebrate the harvest. Luckily, there is someone there to pick up the pieces: JosÃ©. A Spaniard who fought against Franco and now works for the family, heâ€™s picked as a solid candidate for a marriage of convenience. The family hand over responsibility for Gabrielle, she gets to leave the lavender and he can marry money. â€œWhy choose to be unhappy?â€\\x9d, Gabrielle asks JosÃ© as they wrangle with the idea. JosÃ©, played delicately by BrendemÃ¼hl, gives the impression he has seen several lifetimes of unhappiness already. A little more will hurt, but manageably. The couple move to the coast, where dependable JosÃ© begins to build a house. Gabrielle is still afflicted, now with paralysing cramps that may or may not be real. Sheâ€™s sent, on doctorâ€™s orders, to a spa in the Swiss mountains. There â€“ finally â€“ she meets someone who might help her escape herself: a floppy-haired hottie called AndrÃ© Sauvage (Louis Garrel). A veteran of the war in Indochina, heâ€™s picked up a kidney infection that manifests itself in bouts of exhausted sighing. His treatment is gob-fulls of opium and the odd manly grunt to help through the pain. All this Byron-esque suffering is, unsurprisingly, right up Gabrielleâ€™s street. A lot has been made of female sexuality coming to the fore at this yearâ€™s Cannes. From the Land of the Moon continues the trend to a degree. Itâ€™s implied that much of Gabrielleâ€™s pain is rooted in sexual frustration. Thereâ€™s a lot made of what Gabrielle calls â€œthe principal thingâ€\\x9d. This, in Agusâ€™s novella, is love. But Garcia suggests sexual fulfilment is strong in the mix here too. In an early scene Gabrielle stands, dress hiked up and lets a river wash over her. Itâ€™s the pursuit of orgasm as escape. Getting off to get out. Elsewhere the expression of inner turmoil is a lot less interesting. There is loads of Gabrielle running away desperately - into the woods, the sea, a ditch. Cotillardâ€™s ability to tear up in an instant is used to the point of exploitation. Gabrielle is, on many occasions, simply too nasty to care about. â€œEvery time you visit it rains,â€\\x9d she tells JosÃ©. â€œPeople are right: youâ€™re mean,â€\\x9d he says later. He sticks around, still. The film takes on Gabrielleâ€™s listlessness, slumps into an opiated fug. The malady is mysterious and not easily treatable. It just exhausts you. It transforms from a story about release to just another jail. At times it felt like there was no escape.',\n",
              "  'From Boris Johnson to Sarah Vine: the Brexiters about to seize power LIKELY NEXT PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip It is now not just possible, but probable, that Johnson will replace David Cameron as prime minister before the Conservative autumn conference. Some MPs believe that there should be a coronation rather than a contest. If that doesnâ€™t transpire, it is still difficult to see beyond Johnson for PM, as long as he is one of the two candidates chosen by Tory MPs to put before the Conservative membership. The former mayor of London was the target of concerted personal attacks from figures within the Remain camp during the campaign, including the energy secretary, Amber Rudd. She infamously suggested during a debate that, while Johnson was the â€œlife and soul of the partyâ€\\x9d, he wasnâ€™t a man youâ€™d trust to drive you home. And he may still be weighed down by incidents in his colourful past, including extra-marital affairs and giving advice to a friend who was planning to beat up a journalist. â€œMy wife says she will divorce me if I support Boris,â€\\x9d said one MP, voicing the doubts that many feel. â€œBut I think it would be fun. Maybe it would be too much fun.â€\\x9d CONSIGLIERE AND IDEOLOGUE MICHAEL GOVE Justice secretary A favourite among the Tory membership, and could put in a decent challenge to replace David Cameron, but it is believed the justice secretary is being genuine when he says that he doesnâ€™t have any interest in the role. It is more likely that Johnson as prime minister would appoint Gove as his chancellor and consigliere. He is expected to play a key role in negotiations with the European commission about the terms of Brexit. POLEMICIST SARAH VINE Daily Mail columnist Vine and her husband, Michael Gove, were once close friends with David and Samantha Cameron. Since Goveâ€™s demotion from the role of education secretary ahead of the general election, Vine has taken pleasure in wielding her pen to the PMâ€™s disadvantage. She wrote a major piece in the Mail in favour of Brexit and her column is a regular source of barbs aimed at those who cross her husband. FINANCIAL EXPERT ANDREA LEADSOM Leading Leave campaigner She has impressed some during the campaign, during which she was a leading light of the Leave team. She is a relatively junior minister for energy and climate change, but some believe there is leadership potential in the MP for South Northamptonshire. Leadsom worked in the city as a corporate banker before embarking on her political career, so may also prove to be an alternative option for Johnson as his chancellor. However, she was accused of lying during a debate by the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson after claiming: â€œThe truth is, 60% of our rules and regulations comes from the European Union.â€\\x9d STRATEGIST MATTHEW ELLIOTT Vote Leave chief executive A founder and former chief executive of the Taxpayersâ€™ Alliance, Elliott was the brains behind the Leave campaignâ€™s strategy, along with Dominic Cummings. He insisted that he wanted to put forward a â€œpositiveâ€\\x9d and â€œinternationalistâ€\\x9d vision for Brexit, but he wasnâ€™t shy of attaching his name to quotes attacking uncontrolled immigration and speculating about the impact of Turkish migrants on the UK. Talking about the night of the Brexit poll, Elliott said: â€œWhen the polls came in at 10 oâ€™clock and everybody was writing off Leave, we didnâ€™t buy that.â€\\x9d He is known as an effective lobbyist, but there is likely to be a place in a Johnson Downing Street if he wants it. â€˜MAN OF THE PEOPLEâ€™ NIGEL FARAGE Leader of Ukip Even his harshest critics, and there are many, admit that Farage was a major figure in pushing the prime minister into even staging a referendum. He almost single-handedly turned the small party of Ukip into a genuine electoral force with 4 million votes at the general election, albeit still with just one MP. Without that electoral threat, Cameron would not have felt the need to make his promise. Farageâ€™s role in the referendum campaign was typically controversial. Michael Gove admitted he â€œshudderedâ€\\x9d on seeing Farage pose in front of a poster depicting refugees flocking on a winding road under the heading: Breaking point, but Farage was the first to point out that Vote Leave emulated his immigration rhetoric. Quite what his role will be from here on in is not clear. He has previously suggested that he admires Johnson. It is doubtful whether the admiration goes two ways. Nevertheless it is unlikely that the Ukip man is going to disappear. UKIP MONEY MAN ARRON BANKS Donor A former Tory donor, the businessman donated Â£6m to Ukipâ€™s leave campaign, Leave.EU, he claimed on polling night. Asked by David Dimbleby why he had spent such a fortune, he said: â€œIt is something I believe in. I believe we should bring our democracy back in to parliament.â€\\x9d An aggressive businessman with a brash manner, he has had a poor relationship with the official campaign to take the UK out of the EU. He branded justice secretary Michael Gove as â€œdisgracefulâ€\\x9d and â€œtoxicâ€\\x9d after the cabinet minister was suspected of leaking the Queenâ€™s views on Europe. TEMPERAMENTAL TACTICAL GENIUS DOMINIC CUMMINGS Campaign director for Vote Leave As ITV called the referendum for Leave, Cummings stood on a table, gave a roar and punched a panel out of the ceiling above him as colleagues in Vote Leave chanted his name. â€œThatâ€™s Dom,â€\\x9d said a source. Cummings has never been far from controversy. Andy Coulson, who was then director of communications to the prime minister, blocked him from government as too independent and disruptive when Cameron first entered Downing Street. Yet when Coulson resigned, Cummings returned to the side of Gove at the Department for Education. He waged a war against Nick Clegg (calling him a â€œrevolting characterâ€\\x9d), and caused uproar among civil servants due to his ill-concealed contempt for many of them. He was also to become a stern critic of David Cameron (whom he described as a â€œsphinx without a riddleâ€\\x9d). During the EU referendum he clashed with a series of colleagues at Vote Leave, leading to a reprimand from his chief executive. But it is Cummingsâ€™s strategising that many say delivered Leave their extraordinary victory. He is said to be the man behind the â€œTake Back Controlâ€\\x9d slogan. FREE-MARKET GURU PATRICK MINFORD Chair of Economists for Brexit Nine out of 10 economists may have supported Britain remaining in the European Union, but macroeconomist Patrick Minford has stood apart. Minford, a supporter of the neoliberal theories of Milton Friedman, headed up Economists for Brexit, the eight-person group that claims the City of London will thrive, unemployment will fall and the trade deficit will narrow upon leaving the EU. Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeted last year: â€œProfessor Patrick Minford, a top economist, calculates that EU exit would bring the cost of living down immediately.â€\\x9d Minford doesnâ€™t believe the UK should be part of the single market. Instead, a post-Brexit Britain should opt to remove all barriers to imports, leading to cheaper food, less expensive goods and stronger growth. Genuine free trade, it is claimed, would provide a growth boost of 4% of GDP within five years while helping the UK emerge unscathed from the immediate post-referendum turbulence. It is yet to be seen whether Minford has the ear of the Brexit politicians set to take the reins of power. LABOUR BREXITER DREDA SAY MITCHELL Writer A rare ethnic minority female voice who called for the UK to leave the EU â€“ although she refused to join Vote Leave. â€œIâ€™m not leave with Farage â€“ Iâ€™m leave with Dennis Skinner, and a handful of other brave Labour MPs,â€\\x9d she wrote in an article for the . LABOUR LEAVE FINANCIER JOHN MILLS Donor A brother-in-law to Tessa Jowell, and a major donor to Labour before Jeremy Corbyn became leader, Mills is pushing Labour to change its policy on immigration and will continue to do so. He claims the party has become too close to the metropolitan elite. â€œThere has been growing dissatisfaction among traditional working-class Labour voters, especially in the north of England.. â€œThis is part of a wider problem. Many of these Labour voters feel the party has left them behind and does not respect their priorities and values., â€œThis referendum result is pivotal for Labour, and it must be a trigger point for change.â€\\x9d he said after the result. FATHER OF THE MOVEMENT BILL CASH MP MP for Stone He was once regarded as something of an angry pub bore, but in recent days the veteran MP has morphed into an elder statesman, taking a moment yesterday to â€œpay tributeâ€\\x9d to both sides of the House and the people â€œwho have taken a principled standâ€\\x9d. But, as a figurehead of the Eurosceptic movement in the Conservative party, his intentions with regard to the Tory leadership couldnâ€™t be clearer. â€œWhoever takes over [from David Cameron] â€¦ that person, Iâ€™m quite sure, will be a very, very clearly defined Brexiteer,â€\\x9d he told the BBC. KEY LABOUR LEAVER GISELA STUART MP for Birmingham Edgbaston The German-born MP has emerged as a powerful voice in the Leave campaign and a counterpoint in the party to Jeremy Corbynâ€™s liberal views on immigration. It is expected that she will have a role to play in negotiations with the European commission over the terms for Brexit. Her views on the EU were shaped by the experience of being appointed as one of the UK parliamentary representatives to the European convention, which was tasked with drawing up a new constitution for the European Union in 2001. TRUE-BLUE RIGHTWINGER PRITI PATEL Employment minister The former lobbyist caused a stir during the referendum campaign by suggesting the British economy would benefit from a cutting back of employment rights. She has also previously endorsed the return of capital punishment. In 2012 she was one of the so-called â€œyoung gunsâ€\\x9d from the new right of the party who called for a culture of â€œgraft, risk and effortâ€\\x9d to project Britain into the â€œsuper leagueâ€\\x9d of nations. COMMENTATOR/ACTIVIST TIM MONTGOMERIE Times columnist A former adviser to Iain Duncan Smith, Montgomerie was eager for Rupert Murdochâ€™s paper to come out in favour of Leave. He expressed his disappointment in diplomatic but unmistakable terms when it went the other way. He is co-founder of the Centre for Social Justice, creator of the ConservativeHome site and describedseen as one of the most important Tory activists around. TABLOID FRIEND PAUL DACRE Editor of the Daily Mail Within the Mail stable of newspapers there has been an internal row over the referendum, in which Dacre has emerged more powerful for backing the winning campaign. The Mail on Sundayâ€™s editor, Geordie Greig, plumped for supporting continued EU membership. Greaves is set to move to the daily. And Dacreâ€™s vehement voice is probably only going to get stronger within and outside the organisation.

              "  'Lush review â€“ pithy indie chroniclers stage a confident comeback This is Lushâ€™s first show in almost 20 years, so the nerves are understandable. â€œI was shitting myself yesterday,â€\\x9d admits singer and guitarist Miki Berenyi, still swearing like a trooper. Really though, you wouldnâ€™t know sheâ€™s spent most of the intervening period as a magazine subeditor rather than a hard-gigging frontwoman. Itâ€™s a crisp, confident comeback from the early-90s indie stalwarts. Berenyiâ€™s trademark fluorescent barnet is now a sober jet black â€“ â€œno red hair, deal with it!â€\\x9d â€“ and Justin Welch (once of Elastica) has replaced drummer Chris Acland, whose tragic suicide precipitated Lushâ€™s split back in 1996. Otherwise, little has changed. Maybe because they havenâ€™t spent the last two decades acquiring annoying muso habits, Lush sound almost exactly like they did when they were last in circulation. De Luxe remains brilliantly confounding, Hypocrite charmingly venomous, Lit Up a hit of pure sugary goodness. New song Out of Control slips into the set so snugly youâ€™d be hard-pressed to tell it apart. The compliment is faintly double-edged â€“ Lush have always written to a formula, albeit a pretty good one: off-kilter pop songs, distinguished by wobbly high harmonies and a glittery guitar haze. Despite being signed to 4AD, they were never too precious about their sonic cathedrals. Itâ€™s the quality and consistency of their songwriting that shines through here, and thatâ€™s without even playing Britpop-era hits Single Girl or 500 (Shake Baby Shake). Songs such as For Love and the dreamy, tormented Desire Lines may no longer represent the lives of Berenyi or her fellow frontwoman Emma Anderson, but they are reminders that Lush were pithy and vital chroniclers of the young female experience in the overwhelmingly blokey domain of alternative rock. Itâ€™s hard to tell at this stage whether Lushâ€™s career will gain a prolonged second act, but this underrated band still have the power to inspire.

              "  \"Emma Stone to play JFK's eldest sister in tale of enforced lobotomy Emma Stone will star as John F Kennedyâ€™s lesser-known eldest sister Rose Marie â€œRosemaryâ€\\x9d Kennedy, who was lobotomised at the age of 23 after developing violent mood swings that threatened to embarrass her famous family. Letters From Rosemary will be based on a screenplay by first-time screenwriter Nick Yarborough which deals with events leading up to the lobotomy and its aftermath, according to Variety. The film does not yet have a director attached but is being backed by the Anonymous Content production company, which helped bring 2016 Oscar winners Spotlight and The Revenant to the big screen. Rosemary Kennedy, the firstborn daughter to Joseph Kennedy, Sr and Rose Fitzgerald, was one of the first mental health patients to undergo the controversial prefrontal lobotomy procedure in the US. The results of the operation were so disastrous that she spent the rest of her life in a facility called St Coletta of Wisconsin, having been left with a mental age of two. The biopicâ€™s title may refer to the many diaries and letters written by Rosemary in her teens and early 20s, which were published in 1995 by former Kennedy family secretary Barbara Gibson. They reveal the young woman lived a full life, attending teas, dress fittings and social events. Rosemary was even presented to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during her fatherâ€™s service as US ambassador at the time of the second world war. In the wake of the botched operation, the famously ambitious Joseph Kennedy Sr told journalists that his daughter taught â€œretardedâ€\\x9d children. Later, the family described Rosemary as â€œmentally retardedâ€\\x9d or â€œhandicappedâ€\\x9d, rather than explaining what had happened to her. Many believe Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded the Special Olympics as a result of fondness for her sibling. Stone will next star in Damien Chazelleâ€™s musical romance La La Land, opposite Ryan Gosling, and has been cast in the tennis biopic Battle of the Sexes.\",\n",
              "  'Brexit or Bremain? Readers share the one argument that made up their mind Thereâ€™s now less than a month to go before the EU referendum, but have you made up your mind on how to vote? Itâ€™s understandable if youâ€™re still struggling to decide, given all the spurious facts and political in-fighting. But for many of us, one overriding fact or issue will have emerged that might ultimately determine our vote. We asked our readers to tell us which argument stands out for them above all the rest. There was a big response from readers (421 people responded) â€“ hereâ€™s what they said. Peace in Europe Peter Thomas, 44, Carmarthenshire: We take peace for granted, itâ€™s easy to forget our past Whatâ€™s the big argument for staying? One word: peace. The referendum coincides with the centenaries of the battles of Verdun and the Somme in the first world war. The people who died in those battles serve as a poignant reminder of the genuine dangers when European nation states choose combat over compromise, and chauvinism over diplomacy. Today we take peace for granted. Itâ€™s easy to forget that until 1945, European history was one long, repetitive stream of spilled blood and internecine fighting every couple of generations. Itâ€™s vital that we continue to build on the trade, cooperation and relationship-building that have been brokered, peacefully, since 1945. For the UK, 42 of the 71 post-war years have been within the EU, and during that time we can be proud of Britainâ€™s role in achieving widespread improvements in European wellbeing â€“ from the integration of former dictatorships, through the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the welcoming of former Soviet bloc countries into the club, to the rise of the digital global economy. The EU has been a force for good in all these developments. Which begs the question: why allow Brexit to mess things up? Especially with a referendum that, like all referendums, will be influenced more by short-term populism and emotions (anti-immigrant, anti-Cameron, anti-Corbyn, anti-bureaucracy etc) rather than any reflective, rational decision-making on the nationâ€™s mid- to long-term future. Asher Baker, 27, London: The EU was set up as an antidote to extreme nationalism Many want to leave the EU to become a supposedly â€œindependent and Great Britain once moreâ€\\x9d. But realistically, if we leave thatâ€™s not going to happen. Britain has been in â€œsplendid isolationâ€\\x9d before â€“ during another period of rapid, fantastical change and industrial upheaval. Of course, out of these efforts to protect our empire we saw a naval race, several arms races and two world wars resulting in millions of deaths. You might say that was a different time, but it was a mere century ago. As long as governments, particularly western ones, are selfish and greedy and constantly seeking to line their pockets in the name of economic growth, there will always be conquest and conflict. The EU was set up as an antidote to the extreme nationalism that devastated the continent for decades. Thatâ€™s worth protecting. The economy Harshini Andugulapati, 19, Nottingham: I worry about the job market As a student who will graduate in the next three to four years, the economy, and more specifically the job market, is whatâ€™s influencing my decision most. It is the seed from which all other factors such as culture and the environment will grow and flourish. Apart from the myriad econometric models and studies that conclude that Brexit would indeed make us worse off, I feel this way because of a lack of strong argument from the outers, who simply refuse to recognise the almost inevitable short-term economic costs of Brexit. Indeed, since the Tories have proved their unfathomable disdain for the youth of this country, it is almost certain that we would be the ones who would suffer the most. Since Vote Leave wonâ€™t even come clean about what its preferred alternative to EU membership is, the notion that in the post-referendum political chaos Britain could really reach this undefined utopia, where everything will ostensibly be â€œbetterâ€\\x9d or even the same, is fanciful. I will most certainly vote to stay in. The only proposition that could change my mind would be if David Cameron issued a statement promising to resign and emigrate to the south of France if things didnâ€™t go according to plan. Roger Kirkham, 51, Ipswich: If we leave, weâ€™re taking a huge gamble When the British economy performs badly, it affects almost every aspect of our lives. Everything becomes more difficult and less enjoyable. The poorest people in our society suffer the most, but a recession or years of low growth is tough for everyone. We already know what itâ€™s like to be in the EU. We know that itâ€™s possible for Britain to do well as part of it and that in the past (eg the 1990s) weâ€™ve achieved high levels of growth and prosperity. I suppose some huge EU scandal might change my mind, but Iâ€™ve listened to various economic experts, people like Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who said that Britain leaving the EU could cause a stock market crash, and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who said that a Brexit vote might spark a recession. These voices and that of Barack Obama have all convinced me. The EU has its faults, donâ€™t get me wrong, and its failure to act decisively during the wars in the former Yugoslavia was criminal. But I still think overall weâ€™re better being a part of it, although we should never join the single currency. If we leave the EU weâ€™re taking a huge gamble. It might be the best thing we ever did, it might be the worst. But weâ€™re swapping a known quantity for the unknown, which seems to me at best reckless, at worst foolish. Kate Henderson, 21, Newcastle: There are benefits to the free market There are significant benefits to the free market, as have been proven due to existing institutions. All competing claims by Brexit campaigners are guesswork, they have no proof to substantiate any of their claims. Even if we left the EU, in order to continue trading, we would have to comply with its regulations, but we would have no say in how these regulations were implemented. David Stutchbury: Leave doesnâ€™t have anything to prove its case The UK economy is doing OK in the EU and no one knows what would happen if we left. The risks of leaving (which include our GDP going down for the next five years) far outweigh any perceived benefits to the economy. Leave doesnâ€™t really have anything to prove its case on economy, whereas we know that in the EU the UK has the fifth strongest economy in the world. What extra proof do we need that itâ€™s working? If we were to leave I would be most worried about the possibility of credit agencies reducing our rating, which would increase our debt costs. Immigration is also a net contributor to our GDP so reducing it will reduce our wealth. I am voting in and nothing will change this unless I lose my mind over the next few weeks. Sovereignty and democracy Elliot Myers, 25, London: The EU lacks transparency and democracy My vote is not on immigration, nor is it on economics. Itâ€™s on upholding the central value that is the foundation of western civilisation: democracy. There are many merits to the EU but a transparent and accountable democratic process isnâ€™t one â€“ 28 unelected EU commissioners decide on laws and regulations ranging from fishing to finance and do so without the worry of the ballot box. In Britain we expect the elected parliament to draft laws and for the unelected House of Lords to scrutinise them. In the EU the reverse occurs with the unelected commission drafting laws and pushing the agenda for the elected parliament to enact them. The two unelected chambers have the majority of legislative power, whereas the elected parliament has limited power. I believe this undermines the democratic legitimacy of the EU. British fishermen have complained for years that EU regulations have hurt the industry yet their protests are futile. The government canâ€™t veto the regulation nor can the UK electorate apply political pressure through the ballot box. Ian Pexton, 45, London: The basic principle of democracy must be paramount Sovereignty is the fundamental argument here. All other arguments are important (immigration, culture, economy etc) but all of those subjects find their roots in the argument of sovereignty and democratic accountability. As a country, in order to maintain peace and stability, the basic principle of democracy must be paramount. Nothing is likely to cause trouble and violent dissent faster than taking away the ability of the population to decide its own future (which will happen if power remains in Brussels), especially in economically dicey times. Family John Dowling, 43, Sussex: Without Europe my family simply wouldnâ€™t exist I emigrated from Ireland to Germany as a teenager and received a great opportunity through freedom of movement. My wife has a French father and German mother, all our children were born in Germany and now we live in the UK. Incidentally, the UK is one of the most welcoming places Iâ€™ve lived, while at the same time I have never felt so unwanted by politiciansâ€™ rhetoric. People in the UK are so friendly and helpful but since I came here in 2013 it has seemed politicians have been trying to outdo each other in bringing down migration. There has been very little talk about the fact that immigrants arenâ€™t here to just get benefits and milk the system. Without Europe, my family simply wouldnâ€™t exist. To me, that is so much more fundamental than the economy. Enya, 41, south-east London: My family is about reaching across cultural divides It is sad that we all fought to keep Europe free and now we want to separate ourselves from Europe. By leaving we are saying we donâ€™t think we can work together. My family is African and some members helped fight during the second world war. Apart from that, my immediate family are American and I am married to a Brit. My entire family is about reaching across cultural divides. My husbandâ€™s dad and mum live in Brussels and France respectively. His uncles live in Scotland, Munich, and Toulouse, and my brother has links in Norway and Berlin. Many families have links like this and leaving the EU would be very complicated. Families will be divided or find it harder to see each other. The environment Jessica Horner, 23, Plymouth: The EU protects important species and specialist areas More than 80% of our environmental policies originate from the European Union, and without the influence of Europe I do not trust the current government to promote green policies. Environmental issues also cross national borders, so we must respond with international measures. I attended a talk recently and heard from a member of Friends of the Earth about the protection the EU gives to many important species and specialist areas. The EU is also putting pressure on its member states to reduce air pollution, which is a significant cause of premature death. As well as this, there are fears Brexit would lead to development on sites which are currently protected under the Natura 2000 scheme. In 2013 the EU also voted to restrict the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, despite the UK government dismissing scientific evidence of the harm they cause to pollinators. I worry that if we leave the EU it could take us years, maybe even decades, to regain a similar level of protection for our environment. The future Don MacCallum, 62, Isleworth: The world has moved on since the days of the empire Europe represents a great adventure for the future. To leave it now (or at any time) would be a catastrophic error in my opinion, with dire consequences for succeeding generations in addition to being both unimaginative and irresponsible. Ask many Brexiteers why they wish to leave and they are often unable to articulate their reasons for doing so other than a vague notion that Britain will regain status and become somehow stronger as a consequence. They are perhaps conveniently forgetting that the world has moved on since the days of the empire and has become increasingly regionalised and globalised. It would be disappointing and demoralising if Britain were to find itself left on the outside looking in as it was in the 1950s and 1960s. Solidarity Andy Smith, 61: We have an obligation to our European colleagues When you marry you make a solid commitment to the other party, thick or thin â€“ divorce should only be contemplated if the situation is truly intolerable and all other avenues have been explored. The Brexit debate focused on whether we in the UK will be better off short or long term, in or out, is misplaced; we have an obligation to our European colleagues. Yes, thereâ€™s plenty wrong with EU governance so letâ€™s use our influence to improve it. Culture Teresa Horan, 57, London: I am proud of our European cultural identity I am very proud of our open British culture, so why would we want to dilute it and come out of Europe? I am a Londoner and one of the things I am most proud about is the fact that the capital is such a diverse city â€“ thatâ€™s what makes it so rich. I would like to believe that by staying in Europe we can protect the arts and other creative industries. There is a lot of scaremongering around Brexit but ultimately thatâ€™s exactly what it is: scaremongering. We are better and more culturally rich together. Immigration Alex Hobson, 26: I donâ€™t want this country to become a platform for racist bigotry I find the immigration argument to be the one influencing my sway the most at this juncture. Not because I agree with it, but because of how heavily I disagree. In my opinion the argument that we need to halt immigrants coming from Europe is outdated and ignorant and ignores key facts, such as the fact that Brexit might not mean any change in immigration. Also, I donâ€™t want to see this country become a platform for racist bigotry in the wake of our leaving the EU. Brexit would only reinforce and strengthen a British nationalism that has been stirred up by a referendum brought about by nothing more than career politicians. This doesnâ€™t make me want to vote remain necessarily, but it makes me not want to vote to leave. Anonymous, 35, London: I am in favour of immigration, but not in its current form I am an immigrant to this country and so are many of my friends. I am heavily in favour of immigration, but not in its current form. Itâ€™s because of this that I am voting Brexit. I donâ€™t believe that 330,000 immigrants a year is sustainable, particularly because we seem unable to address issues such as transport congestion, and housing supply in any reasonable time-frame. Housing is a major concern. I donâ€™t believe that it is possible for this country to build enough homes to address this problem. In the area in which I live local residents are totally opposed to, and bitterly resent, new housing developments which they believe are changing the face of their city. Every planning application results in an almighty battle with residents and this problem exists all over the UK. Accepting almost unlimited numbers of unskilled workers is not sustainable.',\n",
              "  \"Donald Trump is vetting women for vice-president. That won't fool us Donald Trumpâ€™s woman problem is common knowledge â€“ his misogyny may be the one consistent, comprehensive thread throughout his campaign. It spans his insults aimed at Hillary Clinton, to his run-ins with Megyn Kelly, to his Twitter spat with Elizabeth Warren, to his comments about punishing women who get abortions. Just this week, he told Bill Oâ€™Reilly that, as president, he would appoint conservative justices to the US supreme court in attempts to overturn Roe v Wade. This kind of rhetoric on gender has been destructive and dangerously regressive, and women across the political spectrum have responded by mostly refusing to support his candidacy. Now, however, word is leaking that Trump is considering both former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and Iowa Senator Joni Ernst â€“ both of these people are women â€“ as his potential vice- presidential pick. Thereâ€™s no question that living in the perpetual present has worked for Trump so far, as he flip-flopped his way to the Republican nomination. His latest tweet serves as the best delineation of the current Trump stance on any given issue. But does he really think that 50.4% of Americans have such a short attention span that theyâ€™ll forget his constant demeaning and his insults at the sight of a female running mate? Because I can promise you: we wonâ€™t. For months now, Trump has disparaged every woman that crossed his path, from accomplished, privileged politicians like Clinton and Warren to women in the most abject of circumstances. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 75% of abortion patients are poor or low-income women, living anywhere between 199 and 100% of the federal poverty level. Attacks on womenâ€™s rights to abortion care is an attack on women who are already struggling. Economic justice, economic opportunity and reproductive justice all go hand-in-hand. A failure to see this â€“ or seeing it and supporting policies that hurt women anyway â€“ betrays a regressive worldview that speaks volumes about how Trump might see a host of other issues, from marriage equality to the environment. Reproductive rights, in addition to providing critical healthcare choices for women, also represent a womanâ€™s ability to be autonomous, to be able to make her own decisions about what is good and right for her. Opposing reproductive rights clearly states that you do not believe that women could or should have this ability â€“ if a woman canâ€™t make her own healthcare decisions, well, she certainly shouldnâ€™t have access to the nuclear codes. (Not that Trumpâ€™s lady veep would ever have such access â€“ his health is stellar!) Thereâ€™s a reason women and minorities have refused to endorse Trumpâ€™s takeover of the Republican party. He not only speaks in thinly veiled white supremacist code â€“ make America great again! â€“ he also never misses an opportunity to stoke the flames of a gender war, implying that men ought to gird their loins against the threat of womenâ€™s agency. That includes his likely opponent in the general election. And it would include any woman he might pick as his running mate. Allowing her to smile in his shadow doesnâ€™t make any of this less true.\",\n",
              "  'Uncertainty in the property market gives rise to the Brexit clause With a month to go until the EU referendum, there are signs that property investors have growing concerns about the possible impact of a leave vote. City law firm Nabarro said on Friday that commercial property investors were adding â€œBrexit clausesâ€\\x9d to contracts that will allow them to pull out of deals if the UK votes to leave on 23 June. Next week, a new phase of a luxury flat development in south London will go on the market with a â€œBrexit pledgeâ€\\x9d for worried buyers. A poll of UK and global property investors with holdings worth Â£350bn found that more than two-thirds were pessimistic about the outlook for property values if the leave campaign wins, Nabarro said. As a result, said senior partner Ciaran Carvalho, investors in commercial property, including office and shop developments, were taking precautions. â€œWe have seen a marked increase in the number of contracts which include clauses to protect the position of buyers investing in UK real estate ahead of the referendum,â€\\x9d he said. Investors are paying deposits that they will get back if leave wins. â€œBrexit is a leap into the unknown,â€\\x9d Carvalho said. â€œBrexit clauses are a pragmatic, legal response to that uncertainty.â€\\x9d Residential developer Oakmayne Properties is launching 42 apartments in Two Fifty One, a 41-storey building in the middle of the Elephant and Castle redevelopment in south London, at an event at the Shard. Prices start at Â£655,000 for a one-bedroom flat and buyers who put down a Â£2,000 reservation fee will be able to get the money back if they are unhappy with the referendum result. David Humbles, the Oakmayne managing director, said: â€œBuyers will not be required to exchange contracts until after the vote. If they donâ€™t like the result, whichever way it goes, they will have the right to withdraw and have their reservation fee refunded in full.â€\\x9d The move comes as commercial and residential property markets start to show jitters ahead of the vote. All sectors of the market are now affected. Residential The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported on Tuesday a 2.5% rise in house prices in March, bringing the average cost of a home to Â£291,820. However, the latest survey of estate agents by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) suggests that the mood has altered â€“ partly as a result of the stamp duty changes that took effect in April and prompted landlords to bring forward purchases, and partly as a result of the forthcoming EU vote â€“ although referendum effects are mostly focused on London. George Osborne warned on Friday that in the case of a vote to leave the EU, values would take a hit of 10%-18% compared with values expected if the UK stays. The government has also said mortgages would become more expensive following a Brexit, as interest rates are likely to rise. Henry Pryor, a buying agent for wealthy clients, said the market had slowed markedly. â€œBuyers donâ€™t want to commit to something that could be cheaper on 24 June and sellers donâ€™t feel inclined to take less for their home than their neighbour achieved six months ago. The result? Falling transactions, fuelling talk of plummeting prices,â€\\x9d he said. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected the market to be quiet in the runup to 23 June. â€œI think the market will be subdued until the referendum and will pick up after that if we vote to stay,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIf we vote to leave, I am pretty pessimistic about the housing market ... there will be a shock and I think the market will stay pretty weak for some time after that.â€\\x9d This is backed by ratings agency Moodyâ€™s, which said a Brexit vote would be good news for first-time buyers, particularly in London. Gaby Trinkaus, a senior analyst at Moodyâ€™s, said: â€œFirst-time buyers would benefit from lower competition, as house price and rental inflation would slow down if immigration is curbed.â€\\x9d One issue, however, could be labour in the construction market, with builders including Barratt warning that an end to free movement of workers could slow down the supply of new homes. Commercial Britainâ€™s biggest listed property developer, Land Securities, responsible for the Walkie Talkie skyscraper in London and retail spaces such as Bluewater in Kent and Gunwharf Quays in Portsmouth, said this week it had sold more than Â£1bn of its assets because of growing risks to the UK market, including the chance of a Brexit vote. Its chief executive, Rob Noel, said a leave vote would lead to â€œfalling rental values and a reduction in construction commitments, particularly in London. An exit could be painful for the property industry and those it supports.â€\\x9d The last last commercial property report from Rics found that demand for UK offices and shops from international companies had fallen since the referendum was announced, while a report from the Bank of England said there had already been a marked slowdown in commercial real estate investment deals in London. Mat Oakley, the director of commercial research at Savills, said Â£13.5bn of commercial transactions took place in the first quarter of the year â€“ down from Â£18.5bn in the first three months of 2015. That is still way above the long-term average of Â£9.5bn, but he said: â€œThere are certain buyers who arenâ€™t moving at the moment. UK pension funds and insurance companies are less active and expected to remain so in the runup to the referendum. Other investors are seeing it as an opportunity though, particularly non-domestic investors.â€\\x9d The impact of the referendum was mostly being felt in London, Oakley said, but a remain vote would probably prompt a new burst of activity: â€œI think we will have a â€˜Breliefâ€™ bounce.â€\\x9d Property investment funds In recent weeks, several of the UKâ€™s biggest property investment funds have changed their pricing so investors who want to cash in their holdings will get a less lucrative deal. The changes to commercial property funds run by Henderson, M&G and Standard Life mean those coming out of the fund receive about 5% less than under the old pricing structure, to discourage cashing out. M&G said it was forecasting good returns from commercial property, but that the decision was â€œa reflection of current flows ... designed to ensure equitable treatment for transacting clients and those who remain investedâ€\\x9d.',\n",
              "  \"Twitter suspends CEO Jack Dorsey's account In the wake of the US elections, with the rise of the â€œalt-rightâ€\\x9d blamed for the easy ride the far right have had on social media, Twitter is eager to prove that it can police its own borders. Perhaps too eager. Overnight, the social network suspended its own chief executive and co-founder, Jack Dorsey. A couple of hours later, Dorsey was back, blaming an â€œinternal mistakeâ€\\x9d for his account suspension, and attempting to make light of it with a call back to both his and the serviceâ€™s very first tweet. Hours later, there remain some odd effects around the suspension. Dorsey has lost almost 700,000 followers, if the public counts before and after his suspension are accurate. Dorseyâ€™s self-imposed ban follows a more deliberate crackdown of far-right accounts on the network. Last week, a number of American far right leaders found their accounts disabled for hate speech, including the white nationalist Richard Spencer, the self-styled â€œfounder of the alt-rightâ€\\x9d, who led a conference a few days later at which supporters gave Nazi salutes.\",\n",
              "  'Brexit economy: inflation surge shows impact of vote finally beginning to bite Britainâ€™s vote to leave the EU is finally feeding through to the UK economy, according to a analysis that shows rising inflation is offsetting brisk trade for businesses. Buoyant consumer spending, a low unemployment rate, rising house prices and continued growth for the countryâ€™s dominant services sector point to a strong finish to the year, defying earlier forecasts from the Bank of England and others that the economy would grind to a standstill. But worries are growing over prospects for 2017 as signs emerge that the Brexit voteâ€™s blow to the pound is stoking inflation and hitting peopleâ€™s spending power. As the starting date for negotiations over leaving the EU approaches, the pound has come under fresh pressure in recent weeks and been prone to further downward lurches with every political mention of Brexit â€“ most recently from Scotlandâ€™s first minister Nicola Sturgeon raising the prospect of a new independence vote for Scotland. To track the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for December shows a better than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were as expected, one was worse and inflation was higher than economists had forecast, fanning fears that household budgets will be squeezed by higher prices next year. Six months on from the vote to leave the EU, the latest batch of figures show wage growth remains solid, headline unemployment remains low, business activity continues to expand and house prices are still rising. The FTSE 100 leading share index is close to an all-time high hit in October and the more domestically focused FTSE midcap index is above its pre-referendum level. But the pace of hiring has slowed, retail sales growth has eased off and inflation is at a two-year high as the weak pound raises the cost of imports to the UK. The public finances were in a worse state than forecast in November and, looking ahead, they are expected to be in deficit for far longer than had been predicted before the referendum. Britainâ€™s trading position improved more than expected in the latest monthly figures but substantial revisions to earlier data show the trade gap with the rest of the world ballooned to a near three-year high in the three months following the referendum. Economists point to several indicators suggesting negative effects of the Brexit vote could be more keenly felt in 2017. Surveys and business investment figures suggest British-based firms are more reluctant to spend. Consumers have become more cautious and they expect inflation to quicken over the coming year. Writing in the , a former member of the Bankâ€™s monetary policy committee, David Blanchflower, said some of the data since the Brexit vote had come in better than he had feared but that there were signs this could be as good as it gets for the economy. â€œBusiness confidence is low and there is evidence that optimism is falling among businesses and consumers. My suspicion is that the news is not going to get better,â€\\x9d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. â€œThe consumer has held up pretty well and still seems to be spending and GDP growth at 0.5% is not to be sneezed at. But the fall in the pound and the steady rise in inflation because of the rise in import prices was always going to have an impact,â€\\x9d he added. A report from the Bank of Englandâ€™s regional agents on Wednesday flagged the impact of higher import prices on inflation. But the agents â€“ the Bankâ€™s eyes and ears on the ground â€“ noted silver linings from the weaker pound. Tourist spending was rising and exports had also been helped by the currencyâ€™s fall, which makes UK goods more competitive overseas. Since the last dashboard, the governmentâ€™s independent forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have published a new outlook for the the economy. They predict weaker business spending and a squeeze on consumers from higher inflation will dent the economy next year, but warnings for a post-referendum recession should prove unfounded. Publishing its forecasts alongside Philip Hammondâ€™s autumn statement of tax and spending measures, the OBR said the economy would likely expand by just 1.4% in 2017, compared with the 2.2% it had predicted before the referendum. Hammond, was quick to point out that even that lower growth would still leave Britain outperforming France and Italy next year and possibly Germany too. Andrew Sentance, also a former member of the MPC, said the signs of weaker investment and employment and a squeeze on consumer spending pointed to slower growth for the UK economy next year. But much depended on the countryâ€™s key trading partners, the rest of the EU and the US, Sentance wrote in the . â€œCurrent forecasts suggest that Europe and the US will continue to grow reasonably well in 2017, which will help temper the UK slowdown. Next year may not be so bad for the UK after all, but we will need a reasonably healthy global economy to keep us moving forward.â€\\x9d Experts have warned that the potential Brexit blow to the economy, coupled with the governmentâ€™s continued push to bring down spending will leave many households struggling with lower incomes next year. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that the UK is suffering its â€œfirst lost decade since the 1860sâ€\\x9d and highlighted a squeeze on household budgets that predates the referendum. Respected thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies said workers in Britain face the longest squeeze on their pay for 70 years. This week, the Resolution Foundation thinktank warned the UK faces the risk next year of a return to the squeeze in real pay suffered earlier in the decade. It said 2015-16 had been the fastest year of real wage growth since 2001 but said the combination of low inflation and strongly rising employment would not be repeated. For the housing market, forecasters expect a slowdown next year. A longstanding shortage of homes will mean prices keep rising but at a much more modest pace of 3%, predicts the the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Property firm Savills has suggested that prices will remain flat across the UK. The UKâ€™s largest building society, Nationwide, expects the UK average price to increase by 2% over the year, below the rate of growth it has reported in 2016.',\n",
              "  \"Blaine Harrison's playlist: Declan McKenna, Daughter, David Gilmour and more Declan McKenna â€“ Paracetamol I was introduced to Declanâ€™s music by a friend of the band last year and was immediately taken by his song Brazil. Here was a 15-year-old kid with the ability to write poignant lyrics about the misappropriation of wealth in that country around the time of the World Cup. I connected with the spirit of the song. Paracetamol is a song made of the same substance, but has a vulnerability to it reminiscent of the great songs Daniel Johnston used to sing into a tape recorder in his parentsâ€™ basement. We took Declan out to eat pizza in London and when he turned up dressed like the Karate Kid we immediately decided he had to open for us on our tour. Screaming Peaches â€“ Sad Kid Someone first played me this song on a broken iPhone in the back of an Uber and I immediately liked the way they spelled out their lyrics (who doesnâ€™t like spelled out lyrics?), but then all of a sudden someone else started listening to something completely different on their phone in the front of the car and I couldnâ€™t tell what was being spelled out anymore and got very confused. When I arrived home I looked them up and realised Iâ€™d inadvertently been a fan for longer than I thought under their previous moniker, MOVIE. If I wasnâ€™t so lazy I would re-organise my record collection and find a nice slot for them between something like The Chap and Darts of Pleasure-era Franz Ferdinand. Iâ€™m not sure anyone really knows what pop music is or isnâ€™t anymore, but this song has a cheeky riff and is catchy as hell. Gaz Coombes â€“ Needleâ€™s Eye I can remember Supergrassâ€™s first album coming out like it was yesterday, their otherworldly faces staring down at me from the covers of magazines in French supermarkets on summer holidays. And what a live force they were, too, like the best bits of every 60s band â€“ the instruments seemingly racing each other to the finishing line of each song. We had the privilege of getting to know Gaz on the festival circuit while touring our last album Radlands and we became huge fans of his second solo release, Matador, when it came out. Detroit was one of, if not the, best song of last year but Iâ€™m going to pick another from the same record. With a backbone provided by a morse-code bassline and these huge emotive lyrics, Needleâ€™s Eye feels equally honest and urgent â€“ like the kind of song he needed to live before he could write it. Daughter â€“ Doing the Right Thing Long car journeys have always been synonymous with music for me, and I can vividly remember my dad playing me Lou Reedâ€™s Satelite of Love en route to the airport when I was a kid. I was welling up, sad to be leaving him and had never flown alone before when he put this song on, as if showing me that music was able to articulate something beyond words. Leaving something behind, watching the past disappear in the rear view mirror. I soon became addicted to that feeling. I spend a lot of time driving around London and once in a while a song will come on the radio that catches you off guard and somehow perfectly crystallises a place and moment in time. I had one of those with this song, driving to visit an elderly relative one frosty winter morning last year. The lyrics painted a picture of something very familiar to me at that time, loosing someone close to you to something you donâ€™t understand. Mesmerising. David Gilmour - Thereâ€™s No Way Out Of Here Growing up, my parentsâ€™ friends had a son who was about 10 years older than me and epitomised everything I wanted to be when I grew up into a teenager. His room smelled like a heady mix of CK one and fags, he had one of those giant Swatch watches on his wall â€“ and the Turin Shroud to any nine-year-old in the 90s: a black Fender Stratocaster. As it also turned out, after some digging around in his cupboards when he was away one weekend, he also had a great CD collection (all the Oasis singles, all the Shine compilations etc). Iâ€™ve only ever stolen once in my life, and I will admit here and now that his copy of A Collection of Great Dance Songs by Pink Floyd was that one time (sorry, mate, but actually it changed my life forever, so thank you). Pink Floydâ€™s shores have been colonised to the point of exhaustion, but Dave Gilmourâ€™s first solo album was one stone Iâ€™d never thought to turn over. It became something of an anthem for us during the recording of our new album Curve of the Earth, and most importantly, it was written at his absolute peak, when he looked like a hot girl. So much so, in fact, that the world neglected to notice that he wore the same Guinness Stout T-shirt for the entirety of the Dark Side of the Moon tour. Baller.\",\n",
              "  \"Can Hillary Clinton tap into Donald Trump's support base? Donald Trump is a populist. That adjective might have once seemed like a surprising one to use for the New York billionaire, but polling shows itâ€™s become increasingly hard to refute â€“ and Hillary Clintonâ€™s team are starting to study the numbers to understand why. In New Hampshire, where Trump crushed his opponents with more than twice as many votes as anyone else, exit polls revealed 50% of voters wanted the next president to â€œbe from outside the political establishmentâ€\\x9d. No surprises then that this is also a state where Bernie Sanders easily beat Clinton. Trumpâ€™s outsider status helps explain why the candidate has continued to defy expectations. Each time data analysts have written off Trumpâ€™s chances, theyâ€™ve failed to calculate his ability to deepen his support among existing supporters while at the same time broadening his demographic base. Hillary Clintonâ€™s team can no longer afford to make the same mistake. An article in the New York Times this week claimed that â€œDemocrats are poring over polling data to understand the roots of Mr. Trumpâ€™s populist appealâ€\\x9d. So what exactly does Trumpâ€™s current support base look like, and how does it compare to Hillaryâ€™s? The last major poll to look into this was conducted by CNN and ORC between 24-27 February and had 1,001 respondents. The results show that Trump supporters are more likely to be white, male and live in rural parts of America â€“ and that the exact reverse is true for Clintonâ€™s support base. As a fellow outsider, Bernie Sanders is relevant here too â€“ the patterns of his support are almost identical to Trumpâ€™s with the exception that theyâ€™re more likely to skew urban. In a way, the story of the Vermont senatorâ€™s astronomical rise (despite his recent plateau) is the story of the Democrats that Clinton hasnâ€™t managed to attract. That inability is partly about association â€“ and itâ€™s not just her Wall Street ties. That same CNN/ORC poll also asked what respondents thought about Bill Clinton and found that those who were white, male or from rural areas were most likely to check the box marked â€œunfavorable opinionâ€\\x9d. The association with her husband might be hard to break. A more realistic strategy for her to compete with the populist candidates might be to identify the policy areas that appeal to their supporters. There too polling offers some insights. Respondents were asked â€œthinking about all the major candidates still running for the presidency, regardless of whom you support, which one do you think would do the best job handlingâ€\\x9d a range of different topics in the CNN/ORC poll. The gap between candidates was largest on two issues: the economy (where 38% of respondents chose Trump and 25% chose Clinton) and race relations (29% Clinton, 16% Trump). That parallel gap seems all the more striking when you consider Trumpâ€™s quotes on the issue. But thereâ€™s reason for Hillary to be hopeful: betting markets and pollsters currently think that in a race between Clinton and Trump in 2016, Clinton will win. So she is safe for now â€“ the only only problem is, sheâ€™s safe in the meaningless universe of March hypotheticals on a November election. If Trumpâ€™s populism hasnâ€™t yet reached its maximum, and if Americaâ€™s appetite for anti-establishment candidates continues to grow, the former secretary of state may yet be in trouble.\",\n",
              "  'Cancer drug appraisal needs to be reviewed Sarah Boseleyâ€™s article (Cancer drug companies cut prices to win NHS approval, 18 August) is a welcome demonstration of how serious the UK pharmaceutical industry is about doing everything possible to ensure cancer patients get access to much needed medicines, yet it fails to offer a rounded perspective on affordability and drugs availability in the NHS. Our industry is acutely aware that our health service has limited money to treat millions of patients with wide-ranging medical conditions, but continuing to cut prices may not be sustainable into the future and is no silver bullet. Our industry is playing its part. A long established deal has already seen drugs companies pay back more than Â£1.3bn to the government in the last 18 months to help keep NHS spending on medicines affordable. Medicines and vaccines offer some of the best - and most cost-effective â€“ measures we have of preventing, managing and eliminating the worldâ€™s most debilitating diseases, but whether or not these successfully reach NHS patients requires fundamental changes to the way medicines are appraised, and how they eventually become adopted and used. By over-relying on the Quality-adjusted Life Year as National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceâ€™s main measure of value, many cancer medicines are disadvantaged. More flexibility, as is seen in other countries, is needed. Niceâ€™s basic cost-effectiveness threshold for assessing value for money is also more than 15 years old and has not kept pace with either the cost of R&D or the NHS budget. With cancer medicines now more effective than ever, we are seeing scenarios where some new medicines used in combination with established treatments would, perversely, be rejected by Nice even if they were given away free due to the fact that patients are living longer. With 7,000 new medicines in the pipeline in Europe today our industry delivers real innovation for patients. To make sure that the most effective of these are adopted and made available, companies need to offer value for money and the health system needs to ensure that assessment methods are fit for purpose. This is crucial if we are serious about delivering a world-class health service now â€“ and into the future.

              "  \"Here's why there are no 'good' or 'bad' drugs â€“ not even heroin Before she found heroin, Allison could not get out of bed most mornings. She contemplated suicide. She saw herself as â€œa shitty lazy person who felt like crap all the timeâ€\\x9d. She was deeply depressed, and no wonder. As she explained in an interview with NPR last month, in slow, halting sentences, sheâ€™d been molested by three family members by the age of 15. One of the three was her father. Listening to Allison recount the horrors of her young life, most of us feel great pity. If we were psychiatrists, weâ€™d need little justification to prescribe any drug that might help alleviate her suffering. Weâ€™d probably start at one end of the long list of approved antidepressants â€“ and keep going. But heroin? Heroin, Allison explained, â€œmade me feel as if I could get up and do somethingâ€\\x9d. She could function. â€œI was great at my job ... and I was doing art on the side. I had energy for the first time in I donâ€™t know how long.â€\\x9d In other words, she had vanquished her depression â€“ with an illegal, highly addictive, â€œrecreationalâ€\\x9d drug that she bought off the street. It would be wrong to deny that many heroin users suffer great harm as a result of the position their addiction places them in. And I would advise anyone who experiences debilitating depression to seek professional help. But it would also be wrong to classify strong opioid drugs, and other substances currently disparaged by our society, as intrinsically â€œbadâ€\\x9d or â€œevilâ€\\x9d. In some parts of the world, people seem to be getting smarter about recreational drugs. For a couple generations, â€œsoftâ€\\x9d drugs like marijuana and hashish have been increasingly tolerated, more broadly viewed as socially acceptable and, finally, in several European countries and a few American states, legalized. And why not? These drugs help people relax, enjoy music and philosophize. In fact, pot is far safer than booze in every respect. It makes you silly but not aggressive, it has none of the well-documented health risks of alcohol, itâ€™s far less likely to lead to accidents, and itâ€™s not generally addictive, psychologically or otherwise. (Some people do end up with a cannabis habit that hampers clear thinking and short-term memory, but these effects disappear when they cut down or stop.) Then come the psychedelic drugs: LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and the currently stylish (in some circles) ayahuasca. There is ongoing debate about whether psychedelics are good, bad, safe or unsafe. But compare that dialogue to the tyrannical edicts of the 60s. When I was an 18-year-old in Berkeley, California, in 1969, my friends and I had wrenchingly beautiful interactions with forests, seascapes, music, and each other â€“ on acid. Like Aldous Huxley and other intellectuals, we saw psychedelics as a gateway to a more inclusive, less self-centered sense of reality. We generally couldnâ€™t share those views with our parents nor, certainly, with the police or the courts. Yet despite that, societal views were in flux. In fact, the promise of psychedelic psychotherapy has intrigued scientists and clinicians for decades. A recent wave of research suggests that psychedelics can relieve psychological suffering, from depression, anxiety, PTSD and alcoholism to end-of-life fears. Presently, thousands of young people from North America and Europe are trying ayahuasca, a powerful psychedelic used for self-growth and healing by indigenous cultures in the Amazon region. Like their hippie predecessors, many of these â€œpsychonautsâ€\\x9d feel theyâ€™ve gained something essential from the experience: a broader vision of reality, connection with other people and cultures, a bond with the planet and a commitment to its wellbeing. Well, maybe the soft drugs are better than booze, and psychedelics have greater potential for good than for harm. But what about drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine? In keeping with the punitive policies of the DEA, and the battle cry of the â€œwar on drugsâ€\\x9d, most of us still see these drugs as unequivocally bad. Indeed, heroin and meth lead to addiction â€“ and to misbehaviours ranging from lying and petty theft to full on criminality. After years as an addiction expert and a one-time addict, I recognize how dangerous these drugs can be. And I know that the cycling of desire, acquisition and loss leads not only to compulsive drug seeking (and associated brain changes) but also to a narrowing spiral of social isolation, shame, and remorse. Can there be anything good about drugs that are often too attractive to resist? For Allison, the good was undeniable. Heroin helped her overcome a depression that very likely arose from her history of sexual abuse, a trauma that left PTSD in its wake and drained her life of joy, functionality, and any semblance of normality. Allison represents the rule rather than the exception. PTSD often triggers anxiety and depression, and substance abuse is as high as 60â€“80% among those with PTSD. In fact, the largest epidemiological study ever conducted found an extremely strong correlation between the degree of childhood adversity and injection drug use. When Allison got tired of heroin, she was able to quit, as most addicts eventually do. She found a psychiatrist and learned to live without it, though she reports that she continues to rely on antidepressants. The point is that, for her, heroin was an antidepressant â€“ a very effective one. It shouldnâ€™t be surprising that a powerful opiate can help people overcome psychological pain. Opioids are critical neurochemicals, helping mammals to function in spite of pain, stress and panic. Rodents play and socialize far more easily after being given opiates. Opioids are even present in motherâ€™s milk: they are natureâ€™s way of ensuring an emotional bond between infant and mother. Opiates might be too attractive for some people some of the time; obviously addiction is a serious concern. But that doesnâ€™t make opiates intrinsically bad. I doubt whether thereâ€™s much to recommend meth for todayâ€™s youth, and clearly meth and coke can destroy lives. But coca leaves were used to overcome fatigue in Latin America for centuries before Europeans figured out how to turn them into cocaine. Like opiates, it seems that stimulants can be of benefit in particular contexts. It becomes impossible to define the â€œgoodnessâ€\\x9d or â€œbadnessâ€\\x9d of drugs according to drug type â€“ in the abstract. Rather, the balance between potential help and potential harm depends on the person and the circumstances. The human nervous system is an incredibly complicated chemistry set, and we experiment with it continuously through our actions, our loves, the things we eat and drink, and, yes, the substances we ingest for that specific purpose. Tinkering with our nervous system is a direct expression of our ingenuity and our fundamental drive for self-improvement. Weâ€™re not likely to give those up. The failure of the â€œwar on drugsâ€\\x9d should help us recognize that people will never willingly stop taking drugs and exploring their benefits and limitations. Itâ€™s ridiculous to deal with this human proclivity by labelling most or all drugs as â€œbadâ€\\x9d. And itâ€™s absurd to mete out punishment as a means for eliminating the drugs we donâ€™t like. Instead, letâ€™s expand our knowledge of drugs through research and subjective reports, letâ€™s protect ourselves against the dangers of overdose and addiction, and letâ€™s improve the lives of children raised in ghastly circumstances. Then the problem of â€œbad drugsâ€\\x9d will no longer be a problem.\",\n",
              "  'JosÃ© Mourinho criticises â€˜cautiousâ€™ Liverpool after bore draw at Anfield JosÃ© Mourinho accused Liverpool of being the cautious team in a dour goalless draw and insisted Manchester Unitedâ€™s meagre possession statistics represented a problem for JÃ¼rgen Klopp only. United nullified a Liverpool side who had scored nine goals in their previous two home games, with Mourinho selecting a defensive line-up and seeking to hit the lone striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic with the long ball. Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard and Wayne Rooney were all on the bench while Anthony Martial was absent due to a training-ground injury. Yet Mourinho claimed it was Liverpool who approached the north-west duel with a defensive mind-set due to the presence of Emre Can and Jordan Henderson in central midfield. â€œWe stopped them playing but they also did very well from the defensive point of view,â€\\x9d said the United manager. â€œThey played Can and Henderson for some reason and they did that for 90 minutes when they normally project more players in attack. They were very cautious. They kept always Can and Henderson in position. They had only one player behind the three more offensive players. I think it was their intention to try and control us, which they also did well.â€\\x9d Mourinho appeared aggrieved by the praise Liverpool have received for their attacking play this season and argued that Paul Pogbaâ€™s latest subdued display was the result of Kloppâ€™s defensive strategy. He added: â€œYou know, I think like everybody else, on the defensive side of the game he was perfect. Even the goalkeeper [David de Gea] was on holiday for 90 minutes but he had two big saves to do and he did. When we recovered the ball I was expecting the team to be more dangerous, but I think we still had some important chances and Liverpool did too. They are a very good team. You like to say they are the last wonder of the world in attacking football but they are also a team that defends and thinks defensively. The fact they play Can and Henderson together and control the position where Paul wants to control. We thought thereâ€™d be only one player there but they played with two.â€\\x9d Unitedâ€™s total of 35% possession was the clubâ€™s lowest in the Premier League since Opta began compiling statistics in 2003, but their manager even turned that into an issue for Liverpool rather than his own team. â€œLast season United won here when Liverpool had 14 shots on target and United had one,â€\\x9d Mourinho said. â€œHow many shots on target did Liverpool have on target today? Two. Two shots on target with 65% of possession, you have to be critical of Liverpool. It is their problem, not our problem.â€\\x9d Klopp claimed Liverpool lacked patience in possession and made life difficult as a consequence for Daniel Sturridge, who was replaced by Adam Lallana after 60 minutes. The Liverpool manager said: â€œI am not too happy. The game from the first second was very hectic and maybe that was what Manchester United wanted and we didnâ€™t want, maybe it was more for their advantage. That can happen from the start but you have to find your way back to the way we usually play. We lost patience far too early and our passing game was not good. We had 65% possession but we have to do better. I didnâ€™t expect we would have 10-15 chances. Second half we had chances but De Gea was finally warm and he made brilliant saves. They had that chance with Ibrahimovic. â€œThe best news tonight is we have one point more and a clean sheet, nothing else. We can do much better and we must do much better. We have to stay cool. When they want to chase us, we have to use counter-movements. We had these situations but in the last third we lost patience. It was like â€˜Give it to Danielâ€™. It was a very difficult game for a striker. There was a really good attitude from my side. They tried everything, only with the wrong tools.â€\\x9d Mourinho is under investigation by the Football Association for commenting on the referee Anthony Taylorâ€™s appointment before the game. Afterwards he commented: â€œCan I speak about the referee without being punished? He had a good game and I am happy for him because people with responsibilities put a lot of pressure on him and it was very difficult for him to have a good performance, which he had.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'From Liverpool FC to Google: business joins in pledge to promote safer internet The world has changed dramatically in the 13 years since the annual Safer Internet Day (SID) was launched. Thirteen years ago, YouTube didnâ€™t exist. Now more than half of children use the video sharing website every day, according to a recent report from Childwise. And children spend more time on the internet than they do watching TV. As we become more reliant on digital technology, keeping children safe online becomes ever more pressing. Todayâ€™s SID â€“ marked in more than 100 countries and organised in the UK by the UK Safer Internet Centre (UKSIC) â€“ is an opportunity for everyone, from families to law enforcement and businesses to policymakers, to play their part for a better internet. High-profile supporters include the BBC, BT, Disney, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Microsoft, Nickelodeon, Twitter, Vodafone, and the UK government, as well as police services and schools. All are involved in delivering a range of activities. Microsoft, for example, is doing a SID takeover on its search engine Bing, and will serve specially created resources when anything internet safety related is searched. Snapchat has created a filter for SID that can be applied to photos taken using the app, while Vodafone is supporting with its special emoji keyboard, featuring a #SID2016 heart shaped emoji intended to be shared in solidarity against cyberbullying. The company is also working with YouTubers to create awareness raising videos and for each view, like and direct share a video receives, the Vodafone Foundation will donate Â£1 up to a maximum of Â£100,000 to child rights charities. But itâ€™s not just the responsibility of big tech companies to ensure they are educating and supporting people in the safe and positive use of technology. Other businesses can also make a difference by through customers and staff. Football teams, for example. Premier League clubs Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal are hosting education sessions for hundreds of local schoolchildren, as well as getting players involved in promoting the safe and positive use of technology as part of their youth outreach programmes. Other organisations bring unparalleled reach on SID, with the Post Office playing SID safety messages through TV screens in its network of stores on the day and Nickelodeon creating anti-bullying videos for TV, its website and its YouTube channel. While the day provides a focus for raising awareness of internet safety issues and an opportunity for companies to create some good PR stories, many of these partnerships are continuous throughout the year. The UK Safer Internet Centre sits alongside representatives from corporates, NGO, government, and police on the executive board of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, as well as being represented on safety councils for Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Ask.fm and more. Keeping children safe online is challenging â€“ cyberbullying is increasing and young people are facing increasing pressures online that can have long-lasting impacts on their wellbeing. The ongoing threat from the proliferation of child sexual abuse images remains at the top of the agenda for many companies as they strive to use cutting-edge technical solutions to solve issues that can have huge consequences for the lives of some of the most vulnerable children both here in the UK and worldwide. The challenges are complex, and thereâ€™s no magic bullet to create a better internet but if all organisations step up to the challenge and play their part, we can all make a big difference.',\n",
              "  'Slaven Bilic: Itâ€™s no good if West Ham always need to score three goals to win Slaven Bilic does not want his players to look up or down. He does not want them studying the fixture list. West Ham Unitedâ€™s manager will be happy as long as they relax, play with passion and quality and, as the old cliche goes, take each game as it comes. â€œYou canâ€™t approach it differently,â€\\x9d Bilic said. â€œYou canâ€™t approach it like â€˜today, we are home to Crystal Palace, three points, and then Arsenal, one pointâ€™ because this happens.â€\\x9d From Bilicâ€™s perspective, Mark Clattenburg happened. Clattenburg was an unpopular man around Upton Park because of his controversial decision to send off Cheikhou KouyatÃ© for a high challenge on Dwight Gayle midway through the second half, allowing Crystal Palace to snatch a late equaliser and stall West Hamâ€™s push for Champions League qualification by securing a 2-2 draw. Three points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, West Ham were furious. They will appeal against KouyatÃ©â€™s red card and feel that they are not getting the rub of the green with officials at the moment, thinking back to Chelseaâ€™s dodgy late penalty in the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on 19 March and Anthony Martialâ€™s equaliser in the 1-1 draw in their FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United being allowed to stand, despite Bastian Schweinsteigerâ€™s foul on Darren Randolph. For all their indignation, however, there is an argument that West Ham could have done more to kill off their opponents in all of those games. Having recovered from the sloppy defending that allowed Damien Delaney to give Palace an early advantage, they led 2-1 at half-time, thanks to Manuel Lanziniâ€™s equaliser and Dimitri Payetâ€™s fifth direct free-kick in 2016. Dropped points from winning positions cannot simply be put down to referees; a touch more ruthlessness and West Ham would be fourth. â€œOkay, fair enough but itâ€™s no good if you always need to score three goals to win,â€\\x9d Bilic said. â€œIâ€™m not talking that you can win the championship or whatever with winning 1-0, 1-0, 1-0 because it is not only about your defence, it is also about the opponent. But you canâ€™t always score three goals.â€\\x9d West Ham made errors for both Palace goals, a defensive calamity allowing Gayle to equalise with 15 minutes left, and Bilic hopes his back four will be more solid, with James Tomkins, on the bench here, available after two months out with a calf injury. With Sam Byram also missing, Michail Antonio has been used as a makeshift right-back and he was targeted by Palaceâ€™s flying wingers, Yannick Bolasie and Bakary Sako. The return of Tomkins is a timely boost as West Ham approach a defining period. With fourth place and an FA Cup semi-final against Everton up for grabs, they host Arsenal in the league on Saturday and United in the Cup four days later. â€œWe have a big enough squad, a lot of energy and a lot of confidence,â€\\x9d Bilic said. â€œGinger Collins and Sam Byram, they are going to come back. Even without, we would go for both, try to finish as high as possible and try to reach the semi-finals.â€œ Palace are already in the semi-finals. Yet their FA Cup run has not been matched by their league form. Although it was an improved display against West Ham, a draw stretched their winless Premier League run to 14 matches and kept them seven points above the bottom three. Alan Pardew mentioned those alarming statistics in a meeting with his players on Friday night. â€œThat was a normal, tactical meeting but probably a little bit longer than most. I just wanted to question the players and ask whether they actually realise what has gone on. Did they know the figures that the press have been using about us because youâ€™d be surprised. â€œThe players donâ€™t always take on board what has been going on. They go into training and their view is that: â€˜Oh, itâ€™s the next game.â€™ Of course, as managers we are overloaded with stats and information. So I just wanted to remind them of where we were and I think I got a good response.â€\\x9d Pardew was asked if the players were aware of the numbers. â€œThey certainly knew after,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI made it very clear about my feelings. That is all you are going to get.â€\\x9d Man of the match Bakary Sako (Crystal Palace)',\n",
              "  'Top 10 books about the dangers of the web My latest novel, Viral, is about a young woman whose drunken mistake in Magaluf floods the internet and ruins her life. It deals with a contemporary family, which could be yours, and a contemporary crime â€“ which could happen to you. That crime is involuntary pornography, and itâ€™s not actually a crime. But I think it should be. I wanted to write about it because everything about the issue makes me furious: online misogyny, social hypocrisy and the lack of justice and support for women like my character, Su, whose world is shattered after being filmed in public without her knowledge. Before I wrote Viral in 2014, I knew little about internet shaming, beyond the fact that itâ€™s scary. I knew even less about revenge pornography, apart from the fact that itâ€™s scary. And I knew nothing about the darknet â€¦ apart from, well, ditto. I like to write about things that scare me. And what could be more terrifying than the darknet? I started reading about it when I was writing the book. It seemed so other to me that it couldnâ€™t possibly exist. Like hell, if the believers were to be believed, this was an ugly and mean place filled with bad people doing bad things in very uncomfortable surroundings. Iâ€™ve read a lot on shaming, revenge and involuntary pornography and the darknet since starting Viral. This education has made me more feel more frightened for womenâ€™s safety in our online world, and very concerned about the inadequacies of the law in dealing with it. Iâ€™ve also learned that the darknet is alien now in the same way that a Walkman was in 1978. Itâ€™s here guys, and we should probably learn more about it. Soon we may even venture down into the pit ourselves, just as we donned hefty earphones all those years ago. So here are my top 10 books on the dangers of the web: 1. So Youâ€™ve Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson Accessible, entertaining, educational and frightening, Jon Ronson takes a look at some of the people whose lives have been torn to pieces by online shaming, examining who has survived this, and why. We have always punished people with shame, he argues, but now we have a new system of justice and a new way of dishing out punishment. This online sentencing is immediate, severe, destructive, irreversible and neverending. And itâ€™s served by us: by me, and by you. 2. The Dark Net by Jamie Bartlett After reading this absorbing, fantastic book, I understand more about what the darknet is, and am therefore a little less terrified of it. Itâ€™s people, most of them unremarkable, buying and selling, talking and reviewing. One day, I might use it to buy stationery like I use Amazon, or to talk about writing like I do on Facebook. Bartlett lays out the good aspects of the darknet â€“ freedom of speech, freedom to be anonymous, anti-corruption, anti-authority. And he also talks about the bad â€“ racism, sexism, child pornography, suicide forums, how easy it is to groom victims and ruin lives. So Iâ€™m not going there, not yet. 3. Cybersexism by Laurie Penny I am longing for Penny to write more about sexism in the male-dominated digital sphere. In this pithy and important book, Penny takes a look at â€œnerd misogynistsâ€\\x9d, men who are often marginalised in the real world and who have found an outlet for their anger online. We need to let them know we are listening, she argues, and we need to educate them: â€œYou can hack anything, and that includes sexism.â€\\x9d 4. The Intrusions by Stav Sharez It surprises me that Sharez is one of few current crime writers to give the online world a significant role in his story. Itâ€™s at the centre of most stories nowadays, isnâ€™t it? I was lucky enough to read The Intrusions before its release date later this year, and boy can Sharez do thriller. He writes beautifully, so look out for this one and pre-order as soon as you can. 5. Follow Me by Angela Clarke Follow Me was an Amazon Debut of the Month. It features a baddie, dubbed the Hashtag Murderer, who taunts police by posting clues on Twitter. I loved the idea of a trending serial killer; enticing followers with 140-character clues that investigative journalist, Freddie, must untangle. As the tagline says: â€œOnline, no one can hear you screamâ€\\x9d. Itâ€™s the first of Clarkeâ€™s â€œsocial media murder seriesâ€\\x9d. 6. In the Shadows of the Net: Breaking free of Compulsive Online Sexual Behaviour by Patrick J Carnes, David L Demonico, Elizabeth Griffin and Joseph M Moriarty I read this for my work (Iâ€™m a criminal justice social worker, but I would recommend it to anyone. Itâ€™s essential reading for those working with internet offenders; for those who are worried about their own behaviour online, or concerned about the behaviour of someone they know. An excellent guide to recognising and addressing compulsive online sexual behaviour. 7. Cyberphobia: Identity, Trust, Security and the Internet by Edward Lucas Written by Edward Lucas, a senior editor at the Economist, this book features an ordinary couple â€“ Chip and Pin Hakhett â€“ who are used to illustrate everyday cyber threats and ways to defend against them. I was shocked and scared to realise how vulnerable I am online, but also empowered by some of the solutions offered. 8. Butter, by Erin Lange Dark, sad, but also funny, Lange tells the story of 400lb â€œButterâ€\\x9d who decides to go out with a bang. On New Yearâ€™s Eve, he will select a menu and eat himself to death live online. Disturbing, outstanding. 9. Wikileaks: Inside Julian Assangeâ€™s War on Secrecy, by David Leigh and Luke Harding David Leigh and Luke Harding are award-winning journalists who were closely involved with the Wikileaks story as it unfolded. Their account reads like a thriller and includes fascinating details about Julian Assangeâ€™s childhood and personal life. 10. Life: Love, Lies & Identity in the Digital Age, by Nev Schulman Nev Schulman of Catfish fame takes his expertise and concerns about online relationships to the page, offering advice and warnings to his fans. Viral by Helen FitzGerald is out now from Faber & Faber, at Â£12.99), and is available from the bookshop at Â£10.39.',\n",

Vulnerable patients, mainly teenagers and young adults, are being taken hundreds of miles from their homes in order to receive residential care in Glasgow and near Edinburgh. Mental health experts voiced deep concern about the trend and said it could damage patientsâ€™ chances of recovery, increase their sense of isolation through the separation from their families and even increase their risk of dying. Doctors, eating disorders charities and patients have told the that the quality of care received by patients, some of whom are at risk of dying, is being compromised by the NHS in England having far too few beds to cope with the growing number of cases of anorexia, bulimia and other forms of psychiatric illness linked to eating habits. â€œIâ€™ve seen a rise in calls from people saying their children have been sent far away, miles away, to be looked after because there are either no services nearby or they are fullâ€\\x9d, said Jane Smith, chief executive of Anorexia and Bulimia Care. â€œThis is a life-threatening situation for young people. People are in inpatient care because they are at risk of dying. They are in a very fragile, risky state.â€\\x9d Rebecca Doidge, 20, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, spent six months in the Priory private hospital in Glasgow earlier this year because she was desperate for treatment and could not find anywhere else. The distance had negative side-effects, she said. Despite being well looked after there, â€œbeing sent so far away does compromise careâ€\\x9d, she said. â€œThe outcomes are going to be better if you can stay near home. Itâ€™s really hard to integrate back home or go to another environment when discharged if you are in a different country. It makes communication between those treating you in hospital and those at home difficult.â€\\x9d During her stay in the Priory, which has 25-30 beds, â€œabout seven of the people there were from Hertfordshire,â€\\x9d she said. â€œThe number of English people there massively outnumbered Scots.â€\\x9d Anup Vyasâ€™s stepdaughter has been receiving treatment for a rare eating disorder in Huntercombe private hospital in Livingston, near Edinburgh, since February. After previous stints in units in Watford, London and Colchester in Essex, the 17-year-oldâ€™s condition is so serious that â€œnow she is basically being kept alive in Scotlandâ€\\x9d, said Vyas. â€œNHS England acknowledge that her being so far away is not ideal. Her brothers havenâ€™t visited her since June and no friends have gone up. Most people in the unit are from England, especially the north of England â€“ places like York and Manchester.â€\\x9d The familyâ€™s home is in Hemel Hempstead, 350 miles from Livingston. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, criticised the practice as â€œcompletely unacceptableâ€\\x9d. He recently said NHS children and adolescent mental health services were the NHSâ€™s worst area of care. â€œIt is clearly unacceptable for people to be sent hundreds of miles away for care at a time when they need the support of friends and family the mostâ€\\x9d, he said. â€œThatâ€™s why in April we committed to a national ambition to eliminate inappropriate out-of-area placements by 2020-21.â€\\x9d Ministers had also earmarked Â£150m for enhanced services in community settings to help ensure that mental health problems in young people were tackled before their health worsens, he said. NHS England, despite its professed commitment to openness, refused to say how many patients from England were receiving treatment for eating disorders in Scotland. Expanding the supply of specialist beds to treat people with those conditions would take time, it said. â€œItâ€™s extremely distressing for parents to have a child who is so unwell that they require inpatient care, and itâ€™s even worse when they canâ€™t easily visit their child because of long travel distancesâ€\\x9d, said Sarah Brennan, chief executive of Young Minds. â€œFor many young people the distance from family and friends is one of their biggest fears when they are hospitalised. Being separated from loved ones doesnâ€™t help with recovery and makes the stress of hospitalisation worse.â€\\x9d Dr Jon Goldin, a consultant psychiatrist in London specialising in children and adolescents, said he had heard of patients being moved long distances. â€œBut it shouldnâ€™t be happening,â€\\x9d he said. â€œItâ€™s a concern. Patients should be treated nearby and should be in contact with family. They need support and itâ€™s much harder to get that when families have to travel long distances. â€œPart of their recovery may involve therapy with their family, especially for children aged 14 and under.â€\\x9d, said Goldin, who is also a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists. More young people were developing eating disorders, he said. Genetic factors, personality factors and socio-cultural factors, such as images in the media of models â€œwhich glamorise thinnessâ€\\x9d are among the many reasons for the trend, Goldin said. A spokeswoman for the Priory hospital in Glasgow said it took patients from all over the UK. â€œThe Priory hospital in Glasgow has a reputation for providing some of the highest standards of mental healthcare in the country, and has been given a â€˜very goodâ€™ rating by our regulator, Healthcare Improvement Scotland, for staffing, management, information to patients, and the environment it offers those we care for. As such, we support patients from across the UK and overseas.â€\\x9d A spokeswoman for NHS England said: â€œThe NHS recently laid out very clear plans to expand staff and services for specialist eating disorders and other mental health problems, in order to tackle and eliminate distant out-of-area placements. Transformation wonâ€™t happen overnight but work is under way to improve services for everyone and to make sure care is available at home or as close to home as possible when a patient needs more intensive therapy. â€œTo help achieve this, the government has allocated a cumulative Â£1.4bn to children and young peopleâ€™s mental health services over the next five years, and the new waiting time for eating disorder patients will ensure patients get better care more quickly.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Low UK broadband targets lack ambition using slow and costly network upgrades There is a good chance you have never heard of Chattanooga, Tennessee. A city of only 170,000 inhabitants, its main claim to fame is a song called the Chattanooga Choo Choo, recorded by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra for the 1941 film, Sun Valley Serenade. Though Chattanooga may be small, it has big ambitions, recently becoming one of the first cities in the world to offer homes and business access to broadband speeds of 10 gigabits per second (Gbps). This is a thousand times faster than the UK governmentâ€™s universal service obligation (USO) for all British premises to be able to access 10 megabits per second (Mbps) [pdf], announced with much fanfare in the Queenâ€™s speech this week. The USO will be welcomed by people, often in rural areas, who cannot access even this limited speed. But it is setting the bar pretty low. With a world ranking of 23rd for download speeds, and 39th for upload speeds, Britain is not a strong performer in global terms. If we are to get the UK moving up the rankings, we need to follow Chattanoogaâ€™s example, and set a much more ambitious target of 10Gbps by 2030. Paradoxically, an easy-to-meet USO will actually be more expensive in the long run. It risks locking us into a continuous cycle of incremental upgrades to the copper wire which makes the last mile of our network, when we need to invest instead in future-proofed non-copper alternatives like fibre-optic cable, mobile and satellite broadband. Survey data from members of the Institute of Directors makes it abundantly clear that faster connections will deliver quick gains to the economy. A large majority believe better broadband would increase their companyâ€™s competitiveness and productivity. One in four think it would increase their revenues, and a third say it would prompt them to invest more. As well as boosting firms, it could also help employees with their work-life balance, with half of our members saying they would offer more flexible working if they could rely on quicker broadband. As infrastructure investments go, it doesnâ€™t get much better than this. While our cities are not particularly impressive (London languishes in 26th place in the European Capital City download rankings) it is rural areas in which poor broadband is holding back business most. Connecting the most remote places is clearly expensive, but broadband is now the fourth utility, and essential to all companies. The UK is experiencing an entrepreneurial revolution, but the fact is that it is near impossible to launch a startup with a couple of employees in a converted barn with a connection of 2Mbps or less. With a connection of 1Gbps, however, a whole new world of opportunities opens up. Itâ€™s important to stress that a more demanding target should not mean reinforcing the market position of the incumbent, BT, or even a particular type of technology. Getting ultra-fast speeds means enabling competing firms to enter the market on a level playing field. One of the best examples of how to do this comes from a surprising source: Lithuania. It has the third highest upload speed in the world, as well as the global number one ranking for ICT infrastructure. This came about because, in 2004, Lithuania forced its equivalent of BT to give rivals full open access to the physical infrastructure of ducts and poles at a reasonable cost. This led to an explosion of investment by the alternative network providers, and they rocketed up the league tables as a result. If we fail to rise to the challenge on broadband, we will miss out on the exciting technological developments of the next decade. Self-driving cars, virtual and enhanced reality, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, 5G and above all, cloud-based services, simply wonâ€™t happen without the speed, universal reach and reliability of a network that has untied itself from the copper cables of the past.

              "  'The view on internet security: a huge and growing problem The phone in your pocket gives you powers that were hard to imagine even five years ago. It can talk to you, listen, and give sensible answers to questions. It knows your fingerprint and recognises your face and those of all your friends. It can buy almost anything, sell almost anything, bring you all the news you want, as well as almost all the books, films and music you might want to look at. Whatâ€™s more, it will even allow you to talk to your friends and to communicate with almost anyone. The problem is that these powers are not yours â€“ at least they donâ€™t belong to you alone. They belong to whoever controls the phone and can be used to serve their purposes as well as yours. Repressive governments and criminal gangs are all contending to break into phones today, and this kind of hacking will increasingly become the preferred route into all of the computer networks that we use â€“ the ones we donâ€™t call â€œphonesâ€\\x9d. Appleâ€™s sudden forced upgrade to the iPhone operating system last week was a response to these anxieties. A dissident in the UAE appears to have had his iPhone hijacked by a very sophisticated piece of malware produced by a security company and sold legally, if in secret, to regimes that want to spy on their enemies. This offers its controllers complete knowledge of anything the infected phone is privy to: thatâ€™s all the contacts, all the messages of any sort, whether chats, texts or emails, all the calendars and even, potentially, any voice conversation that it overhears. Itâ€™s difficult to imagine a more assiduous or intimate spy. And once one phone has been subverted, it becomes a tool for spying into all other the networks to which it or the owner has access. This is not exclusively Appleâ€™s problem. The much more widespread Android system is reasonably secure only on some Samsung and LG models and Googleâ€™s own-branded Nexus phones, which are updated frequently and automatically to keep abreast of security vulnerabilities. Other manufacturers have access to the updates but few get them installed in a timely fashion. In the poorer parts of the world, where Android has an overwhelming market share, the problem is especially acute. The Iranian secret police bug their dissidents using a tool (in the jargon of the trade, an Android RAT) called KrakenAgent. Beyond rogue nation states there is an unpleasant and insufficiently regulated market of legal firms that specialise in finding security vulnerabilities and selling them to the highest legal bidder, which normally means oppressive regimes; then there is a second tier of entirely illegal operators who sell tools to criminal gangs. Little of this is used for spying (though there is a market among jealous and abusive men for software that will enable to them to track their partners, one reason why some womenâ€™s shelters are reluctant to allow smartphones inside). Much more damage is done by â€œransomwareâ€\\x9d, which encrypts and in effect steals all of a userâ€™s data, to be released only on payment. Such assaults are becoming increasingly common. Twenty-nine NHS trusts were targeted by them last year. This is a global problem now. Since almost every country will want these powers for its own security services, if for no one else, what is developing is something like an international arms trade. International efforts to police it are urgently needed and the companies that sell us these powerful phones must also be pressed to live up to their responsibilities to keep them safe so that their power is not easily turned against their owners.',\n",
              "  'Forget about a mental health revolution without new cash If itâ€™s Monday, the prime minister is doing something good and kind, according to the Downing Street grid: last week it was prisons, this week itâ€™s a mental health â€œrevolutionâ€\\x9d. Announcing Â£1bn for threadbare mental health services, he launched a report detailing their dire state. Written by the head of Mind, this hard-hitting report was widely welcomed, as was the Â£1bn. One in four people suffer mental health problems but three-quarters get no help at all. Suicide rates are rising, as is self-harming, with services so bad that lives are â€œput on hold or ruinedâ€\\x9d for lack of care, with mental health patients dying 15 to 20 years earlier than others. Beds are so scarce that 2,000 acutely ill patients a month end up sent far from home. Prime ministerial attention undoubtedly helps, when the anguish of mental illness is often worse than it is with physical ailments that get priority. Hereâ€™s his promise: a million more people will get â€œhigh qualityâ€\\x9d treatment, including 600,000 more getting talking therapy (previously known as IAPT â€“ Improving Access to Psychological Therapies); every A&E will get a mental health liaison team; and every maternity unit will get perinatal psychiatry to catch depression in mothers. There will also be extra help for children and young people with eating disorders, plus more crisis teams to keep people out of hospital. But â€œparity of esteemâ€\\x9d for mental health has been announced many times by Cameronâ€™s government â€“ more parity of rhetoric than resources: the tariff for mental health was cut below that for physical health. Less than a tenth of NHS funds go to mental illness, and severe cuts since 2010 have left 5,000 fewer mental health nurses and 8% fewer mental-health beds. Professor Sir Simon Wessely, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says mental health funding has been cut by 8%, telling of severely ill patients shunted â€œfrom Cornwall to Cumbriaâ€\\x9d. His college commissioned a report from Sir Nigel Crisp, a former head of the NHS, which calls for hard targets â€“ such as a maximum four-hour wait for acute treatment and an end to the â€œpostcode lotteryâ€\\x9d. But that lottery is at the heart of Cameronâ€™s NHS policy. What does Â£1bn buy? As the Health Service Journal reports, this is not new money but part of the Â£8.4bn George Osborne was forced to promise during the election, faced with unprecedented NHS deficits. Anita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation, lays it out with brutal clarity: â€œThat Â£8bn was the minimum to sustain services. It doesnâ€™t include any money for improving quality, for extra mental health or for a seven-day NHS.â€\\x9d Along with other health economists, she presses the government to say where the money is to come from. â€œWhat has to give to provide new and better services, we ask. We get stonewalled.â€\\x9d She says the NHSâ€™s ability to carry on depends on good social care, but local authority cash is severely cut. â€œMoney could be saved by early prevention â€“ but in the spending review public health funds were cut by 4% every year to 2020, with its ringfence soon removed.â€\\x9d Luciana Berger, the shadow minister for mental health, travels the country looking for community support for the depressed and ill. â€œBut,â€\\x9d she says, â€œSure Start childrenâ€™s centres, youth services, befriending projects, education psychology in schools and drop-in centres for the vulnerable are all vanishing. DWP work capability tests pile on mental pressure, although the work programme fails to get 93% of mental health patients into jobs.â€\\x9d Cameron was precise about his new services â€“ but the money is not ringfenced to ensure thatâ€™s where it goes. Whenever you hear the prime minister â€œannouncingâ€\\x9d things in the NHS, alarm bells should ring. Since the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, how money is spent has been devolved to local CCGs â€“ care commissioning groups, nominally led by GPs. Many are now so strapped for cash, they will use it on contracting for existing services. Follow the money and take a look at one large mental health trust: Central and North West London. I interviewed Trevor Shipman, its finance director, for the â€™s This is the NHS series, finding him facing an Â£8m shortfall this April, despite making Â£26m in savings. I asked if he expected his share of this Â£1bn to help extend his services. Studying the taskforce report, he pointed to recommendation 58, for the health department â€œto confirm what governance arrangements will be put in place to support the delivery of this strategyâ€\\x9d. In other words, will they force it through and report the results? He sees no ringfence or enforcement mechanism. Will CCGs pay up? â€œIâ€™ve been told by CCGs in financial trouble that they have been told by NHS England to clear their debts first and worry about mental health later â€“ nothing in writing of course. Itâ€™s not CCGsâ€™ fault, as many suffer an unfair funding formula.â€\\x9d He needed Â£1.3m from his CCGs for urgent care, but got only Â£900,000 this year. He needs to be paid fully for existing services before adding new ones. Nor is there mention of local authority social care, on which he depends to empty blocked beds. Half his costs for children did come from local government, but those grants were abolished five years ago. One mental health success has been the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies talking therapy programme, evidence based, tightly costed and until now ringfenced. By getting nearly 5% of its patients back to work, it pays for itself. But those savings to the DWP donâ€™t flow back to mental health. The sheer dogged determination of the economist and campaigner Professor Richard Layard has forced this through, says Charlesworth. But Shipman says a trust like his has had to deliver it at the expense of acute psychosis services. He must deliver psychosis appointments within two weeks from 1 April. â€œBut how do we get the funds or the staff for that?â€\\x9d Funding is so badly administered from on high that he still has no idea what his budget is from April: â€œHow can I plan for staff?â€\\x9d He canâ€™t, of course. But then he is obliged to find logic where logic doesnâ€™t exist. For itâ€™s simply self-deceiving to make brave new announcements of fine mental services without new money, safely ringfenced; and they canâ€™t ringfence old money already earmarked for debts everywhere else in the NHS.',\n",
              "  'Why did the UK change its mind about Brexit? The wedding could hardly have been more tranquil. As midnight struck on the morning of 1 January 1973 â€“ and Jesus Christ Superstar began its run on the London stage, and the first British hypermarket was sucking in shoppers, while Pink Floyd were about to launch the best-selling album in British pop history, and the motor industry was preparing to give the world the Austin Allegro â€“ the United Kingdom was officially joined to the European Economic Community. Here and there people held celebrations â€“ some even lit bonfires â€“ yet most of the land was asleep. Writing the front-page story, a duty that fell to me as the â€™s political reporter at the time, was deeply unsatisfying. Something that everyone knew was about to happen, had happened! Hardly a story that anyone yearns to write. There had been enough excitement and turmoil throughout the previous year. Edward Heath, unexpected victor of the 1970 election and as fervent a champion of Britain in Europe as anyone on the planet, had safely steered us in. It is often asserted now that the British public backed that judgment; in fact it wasnâ€™t given the chance. Heath would hear no talk of a referendum, since he might have lost it. The polls showed public opinion running against British entry, and though in those days, leaders liked to believe that an endorsement from them might be enough to sway uncertain voters, Heath knew he might risk destroying a project at the heart of his political life. His battles came over the European Communities bill, the essential preliminary to accession, approved at second reading on 17 February 1972 by a majority of just eight. Though Labour in office had tried and failed to join Europe, they were now against it. Harold Wilson, the leader Heath had supplanted, said the terms for entry were not acceptable. But the party divergence was not what it seemed. A group of Labour MPs wholly committed to membership formed a surreptitious ancillary force for the Tories. The Conservative chief whip, Francis Pym â€“ sternly instructed by Heath that he must not lose a single vote â€“ would tell the Labour dissidents how many abstentions were needed on each division, and they would provide them. As a newly arrived Westminster reporter, I pestered Pym, who was under cruel pressure to deliver, about this arrangement. He and the chief Labour dissidents would explain how it worked. Perhaps the toughest night was when it came to a vote on a referendum, proposed by a Tory backbencher, which the Labour shadow cabinet agreed to back â€“ a decision that triggered the resignation of the deputy leader Roy Jenkins. But again, as reporters in the press gallery waited hopefully for a sensational story, the Labour rebels saved the day for the Tories: 63 Labour MPs abstained. A Tory leader under pressure had calculated correctly, and got what he wanted. The referendum denied to the country then came two years later, in 1975, when Wilson was back in power. The call came now from continuing opponents of British membership, and especially Tony Benn â€“ the mentor from whom Jeremy Corbyn would learn his long distrust of Brussels. Wilson began by opposing it, before scenting some merit in the idea. Handled well â€“ a renegotiation to begin the process, to be followed by claims that the ECâ€™s deterrent factors had now been extinguished â€“ and the referendum might help cement Britainâ€™s allegiance to the EEC. A persuasive case could be made for perpetuation. We had only been in the EEC two years, too short a time to justify permanent rejection. In any case, the people could be relied on to plump for more of the same rather than risky adventure. Voting not to join an organisation was one thing: voting to leave it and shuffle out into the cold was quite another. That yearâ€™s Brexit was duly rejected by a margin of three to two. A Labour leader under pressure had calculated correctly, and got what he wanted. Itâ€™s said that David Cameron hoped to emulate Wilsonâ€™s success, using a renegotiation to argue that the organisation in which he believed we should stay was a very different beast from the one that had become so widely distrusted. But the circumstances of the 2016 referendum were different from those surrounding Wilsonâ€™s triumph. The European union of 2016 is vastly different from the EEC, vastly more likely to engineer change or frustrate the kind of changes that many UK voters yearn for; dominant in ways that people find menacing. The mere Economic Community had no great ambitions for wholesale political and economic integration. You had to be there, I suppose, to get a sense of the transformations of these past 40 years. Only those approaching their 60s can know, except by deduction, how things felt. Looking back, the world of 1975 seems not just unsophisticated, but strangely naive. In those days, when I travelled the land trying to get the sense of a coming election, it was customarily assumed that the component regions of the UK were likely to behave in much the same way. It was further assumed that when a political leader spoke, people listened; and further that when the day of decision came, they would always choose what they knew over what was largely unknown, and certainly wholly untasted. The voice of the expert was loud in the land and largely respected. Two years (1973-75) isnâ€™t long to start building up resentments: 41 years (1975-2016) is more than enough. There was, too, no equivalent then of social media, where dissidents can so easily come together and disrupt their mastersâ€™ ambitions. Instinctive deference and a stoic acceptance of oneâ€™s dissatisfactions had yet to be abandoned. People blame Corbyn for not giving Labour voters a stronger lead. But thatâ€™s not how things work any more. Whatever Corbyn had said, the legions of dispossessed Britain, making their protests on Thursday across much of the North, the Midlands and Wales, would not have taken much notice â€“ any more than that former heartland of unswerving loyalty, the Conservative party, dutifully heeded to the voice of its leader. It has been coming for quite a while â€“ see the fate of Labour in last yearâ€™s election, not just in Scotland â€“ but we see at this moment more clearly than ever that the old and comforting certainties that used to be the bedrock of British politics are shattering day by day. There were always political shocks, but never before has the golden rule more clearly been: expect the unexpected. The quiet wedding that began in the earliest hours of 1 January 1973 ended at breakfast time yesterday morning, not just in divorce â€“ but even, in this sense, in the cemetery.',\n",
              "  'Bernie Sanders and other progressives plot Democratic party comeback Newly emboldened, populist voices of the Democratic party called on Sunday for the grassroots revival of progressive forces in America, to remake the party and rebound following Donald Trumpâ€™s crushing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who was defeated by Clinton in the Democratic primary, and Keith Ellison, a rising progressive star and a leading contender to become the new chair of the party, both called for redirecting of party efforts away from the wealthy liberal elite. â€œWe have to do a lot of rethinking,â€\\x9d Sanders told CBS on Sunday. â€œDemocrats have focused too much on a liberal elite, which has raised incredible sums of money from wealthy people but has ignored â€¦ the working class, middle class and low income-people in this country. â€œNow we need to create a grassroots movement of millions of people who want to transform this country.â€\\x9d Sanders promised to fight Trump on environmental regulations, and said he wanted millions to campaign on forcing Republicans to action on climate change, which Trump has denied exists. He also repeated his rejection of Trumpâ€™s campaign rhetoric on immigrants, women, isolationism and Muslims, saying: â€œWe will not accept racism, sexism or xenophobia.â€\\x9d The senator, who has described himself as a democratic socialist, admitted he might find common ground on finance reform with Trump â€“ if the Republican held to his word to be â€œthe champion of working peopleâ€\\x9d and has â€œthe courage to stand up to Wall Streetâ€\\x9d. The senator also said he agreed with Trump on the need to rebuild Americaâ€™s infrastructure and overhaul international trade deals. â€œIf heâ€™s for creating a trade policy so that corporate America starts investing in this country, not in China, yeah, we can work together on that,â€\\x9d Sanders said. But he said he feared the government would devolve into an oligarchy, with a small number of extremely wealthy people in control of the US economic levers. Sanders reserved criticism for Democrats, as well, in their deference to the rich. He criticized the party for failing to appreciate that average working Americans are working longer hours for low wages, are upset and â€œworried to death about the future generationâ€\\x9d. â€œTrump tapped that,â€\\x9d he said. Asked whether he supported the Democratic leaders that will now be in charge of that partyâ€™s side in Congress, Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer in the House Senate respectively, Sanders said: â€œIâ€™m not into leaders, Iâ€™m into building a movement that transforms this country.â€\\x9d An African American from Minnesota, the first Muslim to serve in Congress, and leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Ellison is considered a rising star in the party. Last year, he was one of the few Democrats to seriously believe that Trump could win the Republican nomination â€“ a prediction he made on the same ABC programme, This Week, drawing laughter â€“ and he was one of most outspoken supporters of Sanders in the Democratic primary. â€œWe should have to put the voters first, not the donors first. I love the donors and we thank them. But it has to be the guys in the barberâ€™s shop, the lady in the diner, the folks who are worried about whether their plant is going to close,â€\\x9d he said. He said he wanted Democratic party resources to go into mobilizing voters at the local level. â€œThey have got to be the laser-beam focus of everything we do. We need to empower them at the grassroots across this country. Thatâ€™s how we come back. And we will come back.â€\\x9d He declined to comment when asked whether he would seek the DNC chair, or whether he would give up his Congressional seat to be a full-time chairman, should he win it. â€œI will have something to say real soon,â€\\x9d he said. The two menâ€™s views were echoed by film-maker Michael Moore, who attended a large protest march in New York on Saturday against Trumpâ€™s agenda, and filmed himself inside Trump Tower, where the Republican president-elect has his home and main offices. Moore warned that he did not believe Trump was going to improve the lives of many of the working people who voted for him â€œand might make them worseâ€\\x9d. Like Sanders, he also admonished Democrats, saying that the rural poor and city and suburban minorities had endured years of â€œbenign neglectâ€\\x9d. He also called on Barack Obama to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate FBI director James Comeyâ€™s action late in the election, putting a new twist in the saga of Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails. â€œIt needs to be investigated how the FBI director was able to interfere with an election, which I believe is not legal, and tip the balance in what was going to be a very close election,â€\\x9d he said.',\n",
              "  'ONS data shows UK wealth wedded to property Britainâ€™s obsession with property has sent the countryâ€™s net worth soaring to an estimated Â£8.8tn, an increase of 6% (Â£493bn) compared with the end of 2014. A surge in house prices in 2015 offset the UKâ€™s decline in savings, the slow recovery of the banking sector and the governmentâ€™s growing debt mountain. Overall, house prices increased by 7% in 2015 to add a further Â£355bn to the already huge value locked up in Britainâ€™s homes. The Office for National Statistics said in its annual assessment of Britainâ€™s assets and liabilities that the value of dwellings was estimated at Â£5.5tn at the end of 2015, more than four times their estimated value in 1995, when the figure touched Â£1.2tn. A more recent survey of house prices for June puts the growth rate at 8.7%. Such is the stellar rise in property prices that the figure for the UKâ€™s total net worth more than tripled between 1995 and 2015, an increase of Â£6tn, equivalent to an average increase of Â£87,000 per person, said the ONS. Factories and office blocks add a further Â£2tn to the value of UK property. The boost to property contrasts with the state of the countryâ€™s more liquid financial assets, such as shareholdings, employee stock options, savings and pensions. The financial holdings of British households and companies are vast, but overshadowed by the borrowing and the liabilities attached to the assets. So while private pension funds have accumulated billions of pounds in assets, these are weighed down by the demands on them from current and future pensioners, more than cancelling them out. The state balance sheet makes up another slice of the UKâ€™s assets and in 1995, central government could boast that its assets and liabilities were in balance, but the growing cost of pensioner benefits and the financial crash have thrown red ink all this benign picture and created a Â£1.5tn deficit. Part of the financial cost of the 2008 banking collapse was the money ministers spent bailing out financial institutions, which were burdened by bad property loans, and the property industry itself. Bankruptcies were avoided and many jobs saved, but at a huge cost to the taxpayer. In contrast to the US, where many banks and property developers were allowed to go bust, in effect writing off the bad loans, UK banks and property companies were bailed out. The effect was that a short sharp fall in property values in 2008 was transformed into a boom that has lasted from 2012 to the present. The ONS figures show that the growth of UKâ€™s property and fixed asset values outstripped that of all other G7 countries while Britainâ€™s total financial assets â€“ collecting together the financial assets of households, the government and companies - put in the worst performance in the G7. Japan had the highest financial net worth in the G7 at Â£1.9tn while the UK and Italy had the lowest, both at minus Â£0.3tn.',\n",
              "  'Peaches review â€“ a masterclass in gleeful subversion There can be few better places to spend the night after a Donald J Trump presidential victory than at a gig by Peaches, the outrÃ© Canadian electropop artist. If you need succour, it is everywhere â€“ in the regal headdress that Peaches wears for her opening song, Rub, whose centrepiece is a vulva; in the giant inflatable condom in which Peaches prances about during Dick in the Air, shooting silly string out from its tip; in the fans, turned out in get-ups almost as elaborate and smutty as those on stage. If conservatives have gained the upper hand in the Oval Office, tonight east Londonâ€™s Oval Space remains a playground for people wearing Lycra with holes in interesting places, for men adjusting their makeup in both-sex toilets. Itâ€™s hard to stay gloomy for long when confronted by two shaggy, dancing vulvas on a song called Vaginoplasty from Peachesâ€™s 2015 tour de force album, also called Rub. When Peaches reappears after a short costume change, with six breasts dangling from her (one in her crotch), she looks like a grotesque extra from the Star Wars cantina scene, probably cinemaâ€™s most obvious bastion of diversity and tolerance. Although there is plenty of eroticism at Peaches gigs, titillation is often not the whole point: gleeful subversion is. Through a 16-year body of work that spans catchy synthpop, skeletal electro, hard rock and Peaches Christ Superstar, a one-woman performance of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar, the woman born 48 years ago as Merrill Nisker has created a parallel universe light years away from the norm. The norm is a harsh, squalid place where womenâ€™s bodies are still too often menâ€™s playthings, extreme porn is widely distributed among schoolchildren and â€œslut-shamingâ€\\x9d goes hand in hand with heteronormativity. In Peachesâ€™s world, sex is a free-for-all, fun and frequently absurd. Shame does not exist. All genitalia and proclivities are equal. Pussy-grabbing is frequent, but always consensual. The tide of images of womenâ€™s bodies distorted by the male gaze â€“ shaven pudenda, siliconed mammaries â€“ is countered with a surge of ridiculously exaggerated privates and lots of jiggling. Just at the corner of the punk-rock sneer, there is a sly grin. The risk here, though, is that the nonstop erotic cabaret of Peachesâ€™s live show might overshadow her professionalism, that Peaches remains infamous for being a six-breasted freak, rather than the writer of frequently excellent songs. Tonight, her style and her substance are defiantly equal too. Her least X-rated song remains one of her strongest â€“ Talk to Me, from 2009â€™s I Feel Cream album, which comes early in the set. â€œThis ainâ€™t a Peaches show,â€\\x9d she sings to a passive-aggressive romantic partner, â€œitâ€™s just me and you.â€\\x9d Her wide and confidently used vocal range is another thing often overshadowed by all the engorged set dressing. Her wordplay mixes the stark aggression of hip-hop and the kind of freewheeling assonance that recalls Dr Seuss. Rubâ€™s Free Drink Ticket is intense, a spoken-word successor of sorts to Talk to Me, in which Peaches once again lambasts a lover who doesnâ€™t communicate, or worse, lies. â€œYour personality turned to white powder/ Your brainâ€™s clammed-up chowder,â€\\x9d Peaches spits, fearsomely. â€œI gave and you pretended.â€\\x9d For Peaches, lying is a cardinal sin. Contrast this with current political discourse, as witnessed in the Trump presidential campaign and the Leave campaign before it. Itâ€™s a mark of how strange things have become when the mainstream needs to take a lesson in moral rectitude from a topless, pan-sexual provocateur whose T-shirts ask: â€œWhose jizz is this?â€\\x9d (after a Dick in the Air lyric). But thatâ€™s where we are now. For a woman whose 2006 album was entitled Impeach My Bush, making reference to the misdemeanours of the then-US president, George W, Peaches doesnâ€™t mention current events for a very long time. She finally gets around to it near the end. â€œIâ€™d rather not say the name,â€\\x9d she mutters, before launching into a song called Dumb Fuck, â€œbut heâ€™s a dumb fuck.â€\\x9d Itâ€™s hard to know where Peaches can go after this bravura performance. But, naturally, there are still places. The nightâ€™s second encore is Light in Places, a gauzy disco song in which Peachesâ€™s double entendres redouble again. The stage is dark but for the dancersâ€™ butt-plug torches, beaming from places the sun doesnâ€™t normally light up.',\n",
              "  \"Jeff Lynne's ELO announced for Glastonbury 2016 Jeff Lynneâ€™s ELO will be taking to Glastonburyâ€™s Pyramid Stage on Sunday 26 June, taking the afternoon slot traditionally filled by beloved entertainers of a certain age. Lynne follows the likes of Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie, who have attracted huge crowds to the festivals main stage for crowdpleasing sets of old favourites. Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis claimed Parton attracted the biggest crowd the event had ever seen when she appeared in 2014. The return and rise of Jeff Lynne and ELO has been one of musicâ€™s surprise stories of the past few years. When Lynne released an album under the ELO name in 2001, Zoom, it reached only No 34 in the UK charts. However, after Lynne appeared at a Children in Need benefit concert in November 2013, he was persuaded by Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans to perform under the ELO name at a Radio 2 concert in Hyde Park. The 50,000 tickets for the show sold out in 15 minutes, since when Jeff Lynneâ€™s ELO have announced sellout arena shows and released an album, Alone in the Universe, that reached No 4 in the UK. The Sunday afternoon appearance by an older musician has become known as the â€œlegend slotâ€\\x9d owing to the calibre of the artists appearing in it. Last October, Leo Sayer claimed he was in the running to fill the bill in 2016, saying on ITVâ€™s Loose Women: â€œItâ€™s on the cards man. I want do to it. Why not?â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'West Hamâ€™s Andy Carroll twists knife into Bob Bradley and Swansea It was an afternoon when the mood turned ugly in South Wales as Swansea City supporters called for Bob Bradley to be sacked and vented their anger at the members of the board who sold their shares in the summer. â€œWe want Bradley outâ€\\x9d and â€œYou greedy bastards get out of our clubâ€\\x9d were among the chants reverberating around the stadium during another chastening defeat for a team who look resigned to relegation. The only festive cheer was found in the away end, where the euphoric West Ham fans celebrated a third successive victory that lifted Slaven Bilicâ€™s side up to 11th and piled the misery on to Swansea and their American manager. Bradley put on a brave face and all indications are the Swansea board have no desire to dismiss the man who was appointed in October, yet there is no escaping the level of discontent that was swirling around the Liberty Stadium in the second half. The atmosphere felt poisonous and it was not only the hardcore support, in the upper tier of the East Stand, who were calling for Bradley to go. At one point near the end that â€œWe want Bradley outâ€\\x9d chant swept around the stadium as fans railed at the sight of their club sliding towards the Championship. Bradley was never a popular choice at the outset and the results since his appointment have done nothing to change opinion. Swansea have picked up only eight points from his 11 games in charge and, most damningly of all, conceded 29 goals. The West Ham defeat was the eighth time under his watch that Swansea have shipped three goals or more in a game. It is a woeful record, yet Bradley is not solely responsible for the way that Swanseaâ€™s season has unravelled. Their recruitment in the summer was desperately poor and it is tempting to wonder how much better any other manager would do with the group of players Bradley inherited when he replaced Francesco Guidolin. Defensively Swansea are a shambles. Bradley has tried just about every permutation possible with the back and yet nothing seems to get any better. Some of his tactics in other areas make no sense and it was a curious decision on Bradleyâ€™s part to leave out Fernando Llorente, who had scored four goals in his previous two home matches. Borja, the Â£15.5m club-record signing who has scored only once all season, started in place of Llorente and was dragged off at half-time. By that stage Swansea were a goal down after yet another piece of calamitous defending. AndrÃ© Ayew, returning to the club where he finished as top scorer last season, registered his first goal for West Ham with a simple tap-in. Winston Reid added the second early in the second half and it was at that point that the frustration in the stands started to boil over. Michail Antonio later added a third and although Llorente pulled one back for Swansea late on, Bilicâ€™s side were not finished. Andy Carroll, volleying home at the far post, twisted the knife with a fourth to re-establish their threeâ€‘goal advantage. Swansea face Bournemouth at home on Saturday, and travel to Crystal Palace three days later. Whether Bradley will still be around for both of those games remains to be seen. Whatever the board thinks privately about wanting to give Bradley more time, the managerâ€™s position will become close to untenable if Swansea lose in front of their own fans against Bournemouth. â€œIn terms of trying to win back a bit of belief from the supporters, Bournemouth couldnâ€™t be bigger,â€\\x9d Bradley said. For West Ham, who have collected 10 points from their past four matches, the world seems a much happier place. They brutally exposed Swanseaâ€™s defensive frailties and never looked back from the moment Reid headed in Dimitri Payetâ€™s corner five minutes into the second half. West Hamâ€™s breakthrough in the first half had owed much to Carroll, who towered above Angel Rangel to head Mark Nobleâ€™s diagonal pass back across goal, and also Lukasz Fabianskiâ€™s poor goalkeeping. Fabianski carelessly pushed the ball into the path of Ayew, who slotted home from inside the six-yard box. Although Darren Randolph made a couple of decent saves to deny Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jack Cork, Swansea never threatened to mount a fightback. There is no conviction about their play and it was no surprise when Antonio stabbed home a third, turning in Havard Nordtveitâ€™s wayward shot. Llorente, on for Borja, reduced the deficit when he converted Nathan Dyerâ€™s cross but Carroll put a smile back on Bilicâ€™s face with West Hamâ€™s fourth goal. Not that the West Ham manager is taking anything for granted. â€œIt would be suicidal to think we are safe now and look only who is above us,â€\\x9d Bilic said. â€œIt is still very tight but we have to use this to gain confidence and continue to improve. Only then we will have a chance to finish good.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Reform call will mean sweet FA unless Premier League excesses are curbed There are, inevitably, mixed feelings about seeing past chairmen and directors of the Football Association speaking out now about the need to curb the Premier Leagueâ€™s power, given their propensity mostly to do nothing about it when they had the chance, in the actual job. That might be unfair to David Triesman, who was savaged by the Premier League during his unhappy stint as chairman for daring to assert the primacy of the FA, but the reform proposals of David Bernstein and Greg Dyke, which they failed to secure, always seemed aimed more at the FA itself, and in office they were not noted critics of the Premier League. Dyke, characteristically vocal now, famously told the in an interview while he was the chairman of footballâ€™s still-distinguished and historic governing body, that he had so much money personally, he â€œdidnâ€™t give a fuckâ€\\x9d. Yet rather than revel in that personal financial independence by taking on the billionaire vested interests of the Premier League for the gameâ€™s greater all-round good, Dyke somehow ended up implementing a redundancy programme at the FA itself, sacking 100 people, some of whom are still not in work a year on â€“ so presumably still have to â€œgive a fuckâ€\\x9d. The busyness of Damian Collins MP, the chair of the culture, media and sport committee, drafting yet another backbench bill to reform football â€“ this one a vote of no confidence in the FA, which seems a little over the top â€“ is meaningless without government support. Collins is a Conservative, so he could be doing the difficult job of seeking to persuade his colleagues in government that although they have one or two fine national messes of their own to salvage, they should make time for football reform as a priority. Without it, this is more talk, of which there has been a great deal over the past 24 years, in which the rehabilitated, seated, moneyed new age of the Premier League has been accompanied by unease and disillusionment over its hyper-commercialisation and inequality. Every parliamentary inquiry since the new Labour governmentâ€™s Football Task Force of 1997 has taken evidence, had a solemn think and reached the same conclusions. Football has wonderful traditions in England, support for the game is phenomenal, but the 1992 breakaway of the then Football League First Division clubs, so as not to share their pay-TV bonanza with the rest of the game, rocket-fuelled the necessary modernisation of the sport with a culture of greed. During these discussions the FAâ€™s executives, including some of these five who are public reformers now, have resisted that analysis and stood in a huddle with the Premier and Football Leagues against the campaigns of supporters, assuring governments that all is well. These five should nevertheless be listened to because they are clearly speaking from experience about the inability of the FA to govern the Premier League â€œjuggernautâ€\\x9d. The most insightful point in their letter to Collins is that even the money the Premier League does now distribute, which is only around 6% of the Â£8bn being reaped by 20 clubs from their latest 2016-19 TV bonanza, â€œis wielded to assert beneficial positions for the Premier Leagueâ€\\x9d. The crumbs for the Football League have regularly been given with an ultimatum from the Premier League chief executive, now executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, that if the 72 clubs did not accept rules, for example on youth development, all the funding would be cut. For all the private grumbling, the Football League has meekly fallen into line over the years, rather than lose a million pounds here or there for each Championship club. Scudamore, of course, represents rich clubs now mostly owned by overseas investors, who bought them as assets to make money for themselves from the boom in the TV rights. His job is to achieve that for them, for the â€œshareholdersâ€\\x9d. Alan Pardew slipped out last week a reflection that the US investors in his club, Crystal Palace, â€œperhaps donâ€™t know a lot about footballâ€\\x9d, but that is another truth that mostly dare not speak its name and it was reported as a faux pas by Pardew. There were positive results from the Football Task Force; the Premier League was pressed into distributing money for the first time to grassroots facilities: 5%, via the Football Foundation. The Burns review, a reform document of moderate ambition focused on the FA, at least resulted in independent chairmen and now two non-executive directors for the FA, which led to Triesman, Bernstein and Dyke fulfilling the role. Over time, these public outcries, combined with increased professionalism of clubs, has led to a more rounded, socially responsive approach than the unattractive money frenzy of the Premier Leagueâ€™s first few years, which made the first fortunes for the selling English owners. Scudamore has also learned when facing these regular challenges how to lobby governments about the Premier Leagueâ€™s Hollywoodâ€‘style TV dominance internationally and demonstrate the extensive community work that clubs have developed at home. The perennial result has been that governments have soon been won over by the Premier Leagueâ€™s success story and, rather than seek to curb its excesses, have tended to snuggle up for reflected glamour. There is no sign so far that this government will be any different, so when Collinsâ€™s committee hosts the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, on Tuesday perhaps he and his fellow MPs could put her through some of the same righteous interrogation they seem to like dishing out to the FA.',\n",
              "  'Environmental health officers call for smoking ban in playgrounds Smoking should be banned in all parks and playgrounds to reduce the chances of children growing up thinking that using cigarettes is normal, environmental health officers have told ministers. Zoos, theme parks and anywhere else children play should also become no-smoking zones, in a significant proposed expansion of the outdoor areas in which smokers cannot light up. Smoking has been illegal in enclosed public places such as bars, nightclubs and restaurants, as well as public transport and work vehicles, across the UK since 2007. But the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health said on Monday it wants local councils to designate any place where children play or learn as a smoking exclusion zone, although adherence would be voluntary, not statutory. Banning it in those locations would also protect children from secondhand smoke, it says. A new YouGov poll commissioned by the CIEH shows that 89% of 4,300 adults surveyed back a ban on smoking in childrenâ€™s play areas, while 57% want it to end in public parks. â€œIt is abundantly clear that the vast majority of people would support restrictions on smoking in childrenâ€™s play areas. We would like to see smoking being stubbed out wherever children play or learn,â€\\x9d said Anne Godfrey, the CIEH chief executive. â€œThis would not only include childrenâ€™s playgrounds but could see no-smoking zones extended to public parks, zoos and theme parks. Children should be able to have fun and enjoy themselves without seeing someone smoking and thinking this is normal behaviour,â€\\x9d she added. Some councils have already moved to try to stop people smoking in some outdoor places. For example, Coventry city council has asked parents not to smoke outside the gates of its 82 primary schools. The policy has gone down well with parents and headteachers, the council said. Wrexham has also decreed that playgrounds, school gates and bus shelters should be regarded as smoke-free places, while Nottingham city council seeks to ensure that all its outdoor attractions are smoke-free for the six weeks of the school summer holidays. â€œPublic opinion â€“ and not just among parents â€“ has swung heavily in favour of protecting children from exposure to tobacco smoke and from the behavioural cues children pick up from seeing adults smoking. This is a real opportunity to make it easier for children to grow up healthy,â€\\x9d said Jim McManus, the director of public health at Hertfordshire county council. â€œParents and children, when given the choice, are overwhelmingly supportive of smoke-free playground. Local voluntary schemes have been popular. Itâ€™s time to give parents what they are asking for. You might feel like this is the nanny state â€“ youâ€™d be wrong,â€\\x9d McManus added. Forest, the smokersâ€™ rights group, called to the plan â€œOrwellianâ€\\x9d. Its director, Simon Clark, said: â€œExtending the smoking ban to outdoor parks and play areas would be a gross overreaction. Thereâ€™s no evidence that a significant number of people smoke near children in outdoor areas, nor is there evidence that smoking outside is a threat to anyone elseâ€™s health.â€\\x9d Clark added: â€œPublic parks are for the enjoyment of everyone, including smokers. Most smokers use their common sense and smoke accordingly. They donâ€™t need government dictating how they behave. The idea that children should be protected from the sight of someone smoking is Orwellian. Adults canâ€™t be expected to be perfect role models for other peopleâ€™s children.â€\\x9d The owners of zoos and theme parks, because they are private businesses, should be allowed to decide whether smoking is banned, Clark said. It became illegal last October to smoke in a car in England or Wales carrying anyone under the age of 18. New figures last week showed that the proportion of adults in England who smoke had fallen to a record low of 16.9%. Deborah Arnott, the director of Action on Smoking and Health, said: â€œWhile the ban on smoking in indoor public places resulted in significant health benefits, thousands of children are still exposed to smoke in the home and elsewhere. Growing up in a smoke-free environment is one of the best ways of ensuring that they are not attracted to smoking and lured into a lifelong addiction and ill-health.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Conflating public and private lives makes fools of us all As financiers from RBSâ€™s Fred Goodwin to Northern Rockâ€™s Adam Applegarth and the IMFâ€™s Dominique Strauss-Kahn have demonstrated, senior bankers are quite as likely as, say, Boris Johnson and members of the SNP to embark on extramarital relationships, sometimes discovered before they move on, sometimes not. Though given the superhuman abilities reflected in the bankersâ€™ salaries, it should be emphasised that they are obviously many thousands of times better at conducting affairs than the average married person and would take their talents abroad if anyone questioned their rewards in this respect, with grievous consequences for the British economy. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio, the CEO of Lloyds Banking Group, is entitled to ask why his recent sightseeing in Singapore, accompanied by the chief executive of the Russell Group, Wendy Piatt, was of such interest to Sun readers, that the paper revealed it, beneath the front-page headline: Lloyds Bonk. That the bank is still 9% state-owned cannot amount to the publicâ€™s right to CEO uxoriousness or not, anyway, at the same time that the once-dedicated shagger Boris Johnson is promoted to prime ministerâ€™s understudy. If anything, modern Westminster shows that, while not exactly compulsory, a furious extra-marital sex life is a tremendous way for a male public servant to create interest and progress his career. On the left, John, now Lord Prescott, rose from shifty practitioner of the office knee-trembler to become one of the greatest moralists of the age, certainly a rival for John Major. It remains only for women MPs to be rewarded, or pardoned, for the same enthusiasm, before the parliamentary sex scandal is redefined as the obvious stepping stone between backbencher and junior minister. Though, as David Mellorâ€™s career reminds us, why stop there? As for any link between continence and competence, Horta-OsÃ³rioâ€™s record, like Johnsonâ€™s, speaks for itself. Give or take a further 3,000 job losses, a fall in profits and a record fine for mishandled PPI claims, Lloyds bank is now in such excellent shape that Horta-OsÃ³rioâ€™s latest pay deal, including a 6% salary rise, was Â£8.5m. Having established that Horta-OsÃ³rio had not claimed any Piatt-related costs of his trip on expenses, Lloyds told the Sun: â€œIn this regard, the review found there were no breaches of the groupâ€™s policy and there was no case to answer.â€\\x9d It continued: â€œLloyds has been returned to financial health over the last five years under the leadership of AntÃ³nio, and is well-placed to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper.â€\\x9d But in another regard, it might have added, AntÃ³nio had a little explaining to do. Shortly after his arrival at Lloyds, Horta-OsÃ³rio introduced a code of personal responsibility, one intrusive enough to satisfy the Sun, and designed to help Lloyds staff to â€œstrive to always do the right thingâ€\\x9d. Incentives were included: â€œWe take any non-compliance with the codes very seriously.â€\\x9d I recommend the codeâ€™s crystalline â€œdecision guideâ€\\x9d to any employee who is contemplating something that might not merely make them look exceptionally silly, but cost them their job. For instance, a married employee might ask himself/herself: â€œI would like to meet my girlfriend/boyfriend while on company business in Singapore, then take boat trips together, even though discovery would cause personal and professional agonies and raise unfair questions about my judgment and expenses. What should I do?â€\\x9d In this instance, the decision guide would lead the troubled employee straight to three questions: â€œAm I leading by example?â€\\x9d; â€œWould Lloyds Banking Group be comfortable if my actions were reported externally?â€\\x9d and; â€œWould I be happy to tell my colleagues, friends and family about my actions?â€\\x9d If, like our fictitious employee, you answered no/not sure to one or more, then the code is clear: â€œContact your line manager or a responsible senior leader in your business area for further advice and guidance.â€\\x9d The glaring omission here is how to proceed if you are already CEO of Lloyds and therefore have no line manager or responsible senior leader with whom to discuss your Singapore trip. In earlier times, Mr Horta-OsÃ³rio praised his wifeâ€™s advice â€“ she recommended he take the Lloyds job â€“ but in this case, that, presumably, was contra-indicated. Perhaps the careless code-writers thought it inconceivable that any leader brilliant enough to help Britain prosper wouldnâ€™t also be enough of a genius not to breach his own regulations by taking an ostensibly adulterous mini-break on the Singaporean harbour front. Such a gigantic talent would be sure to remain, judiciously, indoors. One recalls that even Prescott was exposed only after his diary secretaryâ€™s boyfriend went to the Daily Mirror. It becomes clearer why, in what first resembled some grim, public-appeasing precedent, Mr Horta-OsÃ³rio felt compelled to issue a staff memo much praised by PRs and trumpeted by the Sun as a â€œgrovelling apologyâ€\\x9d. On examination, there is little sign of accountability in Mr Horta-OsÃ³rioâ€™s effort, which adheres strictly to the â€œmistakes were madeâ€\\x9d method of apology, so dear to politicians and bankers, that regrets, preferably in the first person plural, whatever unfortunate circumstances have mysteriously arisen. More than anything it recalls those forced HBOS apologies: â€œWe are profoundly and I think unreservedly sorry at the turn of events.â€\\x9d In the current case, Mr Horta-OsÃ³rio says: â€œI deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicityâ€\\x9d (ie, being found out); he dwells on the companyâ€™s â€œmajor accomplishmentsâ€\\x9d; he delicately alludes, as he must, to the code he has transgressed â€“ â€œthe highest professional standardsâ€\\x9d. From which it is but a short step to shared responsibility. â€œWe must recognise that mistakes will be made. I donâ€™t expect anyone to get everything all the time.â€\\x9d Quite. It would be ridiculous to think that, in the lower regions of the Lloyds banking group, nobody on a fraction of his Â£8.5m would impulsively do something, as prohibited by the Antonine Code, that they would be unhappy to tell their colleagues, friends or family about. Perhaps it is not so unreasonable, however, for Mr Horta-OsÃ³rioâ€™s co-workers, and even for the public, with its 9% holding, to wonder if someone in such hilarious contravention of his code can be worth the full Â£8.5m. Can AntÃ³nio, the star in his own revival of Measure for Measure, be the right person to lead by example? Either, as Mr Horta-OsÃ³rio says, his â€œpersonal life is obviously a private matterâ€\\x9d, and elements of his code are an outrageous imposition, in which case heâ€™s in the wrong, or his code is defensible and he is in the wrong for non-compliance. â€œI strongly believe you should link compensation with performance,â€\\x9d he has said. A merciful public might conclude that, if Mr Horta-OsÃ³rio is not to join the blameless 3,000 staff now earmarked for disposal, he should continue in employment only on a salary that better demonstrates this link, Â£15,156 per year being both generous to him, and the same as a Lloyds customer service assistant.',\n",
              "  'Macaulay Culkin: â€˜No, I was not pounding six grand of heroin a monthâ€™ Of all modern myths, it is the fall of the child star that most compels us. Whether theyâ€™re embarking on 55-hour marriages, throwing bongs out of windows or abandoning monkeys at customs, we canâ€™t seem to get enough. Thereâ€™s something pathological in our need to tear down our icons of innocence, which might explain the overprotective nature of Macaulay Culkinâ€™s US publicist, who wants to see all my questions upfront. I refuse. I thought we could just ... have a chat? The interview, Culkinâ€™s biggest in 10 years, is supposed to focus on his comeback. Iâ€™m instructed to avoid anything negative. I ask if I can ask if he has any regrets. â€œRegrets sounds too negative,â€\\x9d is the response. When we meet, in the lobby of a hotel in Spain, Iâ€™m still trying to figure out what exactly this comeback consists of. Culkinâ€™s filming an advert for Compare the Market, which is obviously not a passion project. â€œIt was fun, and we hammered that sucker out pretty quickly. The biggest scene was me sitting on a bench eating ice-cream.â€\\x9d Is he doing this to fund an exciting new venture? â€œNo, not necessarily.â€\\x9d Heâ€™s dressed grungily, long hair man-bunned back, boots open-laced, blazer badge-studded. He doesnâ€™t project the focused careerism of most actors. â€œPeople feel they have to be in perpetual motion, or drown. Iâ€™ve never had a problem saying Iâ€™ve got nothing lined up. Maybe Iâ€™ll take the next year off.â€\\x9d It sounds as if heâ€™s not particularly drawn to acting at all. â€œIâ€™m not much active,â€\\x9d he concedes. â€œIf I knew what I wanted to do, Iâ€™d be writing it myself.â€\\x9d The trajectory of Culkinâ€™s life feels like fallout from an atomic blast. By the age of 12, Uncle Buck, two Home Alone films, My Girl and (to a lesser extent) Richie Rich had made him the most successful child actor of all time. At 14, he became legally emancipated from his parents; both had been trying to gain control of his $17m fortune in their divorce. Culkin married at 17, and separated two years later. Sleepovers with Michael Jackson became public knowledge when he was called as a defence witness at the singerâ€™s molestation trial. Iâ€™m ghoulishly fascinated by this alien childhood. Iâ€™d like to ask about Michael Jackson. â€œI think itâ€™s best you donâ€™t,â€\\x9d interjects his manager. She is one of three people sitting with us. â€œItâ€™s not that itâ€™s a painful topic ...â€\\x9d begins Culkin. His manager insists we move on, the PR next to her agrees. Culkin clearly wants to say something, but six eyes are telling him not to. I suspect weâ€™re both wondering why weâ€™re here; 35-year-old Culkin doesnâ€™t do this sort of thing any more, having turned his back on the spotlight. â€œI donâ€™t just turn my back, I actively donâ€™t want it. The paps go after me because I donâ€™t whore myself out.â€\\x9d He has spent a decade turning down interviews, and mostly lives in France, where the aloof Parisians leave him alone. (Itâ€™s also where Kevin McCallisterâ€™s family were headed when they left him Home Alone, but we canâ€™t talk about that.) I get the impression heâ€™s as eager to talk about a price comparison website as I am to ask about one. Instead, I ask why people are still fascinated by him. â€œI have no idea. I was thinking about this the other day â€“ Iâ€™d crossed the wrong street, picked up a tail, suddenly thereâ€™s a crush of 20 paparazzi. Then people with cameraphones get involved. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m worthy of that.â€\\x9d Has it got better with time? â€œItâ€™s been like that my whole adult life. You take on a prey-like attitude, always scanning the horizon. Itâ€™s strange on dates, as it looks like youâ€™re not paying attention. But Iâ€™ve stopped trying to think of myself in the third person, because thatâ€™s just gonna drive me nuts.â€\\x9d You had to think about yourself in the third person? â€œExactly. Macaulay Culkin is out there, and Iâ€™m Mac. You guys can play with the first one.â€\\x9d Heâ€™s not averse to a bit of playing himself, for Culkin is the celebrityâ€™s meta-celebrity. You may remember the meme-meltdown a few years back when Ryan Gosling was pictured wearing a T-shirt of Kevin McCallister. Culkin responded by creating a T-shirt that pictured Gosling wearing the shirt, before Gosling responded in kind, being photographed wearing a T-shirt of Culkin wearing a T-shirt of Gosling wearing a T-shirt of Culkin. They may still be at it for all we know. Culkinâ€™s previous ads, for the likes of Orange (and, in a Partridge move, the rebranding of Norwich Union), trade in close-to-the-bone self-analysis. For Compare the Market, he plays a hitchhiker picked up by the lovable meerkats, who see him as a child, buying him ice-cream and making him ride merry-go-rounds heâ€™s too big for. In 2006, Culkin wrote an experimental novel, Junior, from the perspective of a certifiable child star with father issues. In web comedy :DRYVRS, heâ€™s a blood-spattered sadist, unhinged by the childhood trauma of parental abandonment, and defending himself against home invaders. Is all this self-quoting what heâ€™s drawn to, or just what he gets offered? â€œA bit of both. It suits my personality and sense of humour. But I would be game for something non-self-referential.â€\\x9d Given this dilemma â€“ constantly returning to a past he wants distance from â€“ where does his sense of self come from? â€œFrom me. I try to figure out what makes me happy â€“ and not in a superficial way. I keep my soul fit.â€\\x9d Is he spiritual? â€œI know enough to know I donâ€™t know. I was raised Catholic, so thereâ€™s a lot of guilt. Weâ€™re born with original sin.â€\\x9d He veers off into a joke. â€œSince I was told that, Iâ€™ve been trying to come up with even more original sins, thatâ€™ll really blow my priest away at confession. Like, hereâ€™s one you havenâ€™t heard â€“ it involves a pitching wedge, a donkey and a bucket of ice.â€\\x9d And two meerkats? â€œYeah! You might wanna record this one!â€\\x9d He reflects. â€œActually, Iâ€™m very much at peace lately. I can debate with people, and my heart rate never changes.â€\\x9d And Culkin is witty and affable. Funny, but distant. He offers confrontational figures of speech amiably. â€œIf you want to get into an argument with an artist, ask them what art is,â€\\x9d he says. â€œIf you want to make an actor feel uncomfortable, ask them what theyâ€™re doing next.â€\\x9d (I hastily scribble out one of the few questions Iâ€™ve written down.) Are his debates political? â€œI have leanings, but Iâ€™m the definition of a disenfranchised voter â€“ I think the system is ugly. This whole Trump thing is amazing.â€\\x9d (Trump cameos in Home Alone 2, showing our hero the way to the Plaza Hotel lobby, although we canâ€™t talk about it.) Culkin doesnâ€™t want to be drawn further. â€œDiscussing politics is the quickest way to alienate people, so I donâ€™t wanna go into it.â€\\x9d And Trump has enough column inches? â€œExactly! Heâ€™s like the Candyman, we have to stop saying his name.â€\\x9d Culkin was acting at four, an age at which no one knows what they want beyond watching cartoons and eating oversugared cereal. Having described himself as â€œeffectively retiredâ€\\x9d, he works occasionally (voices for Seth Greenâ€™s Robot Chicken, cameoing as himself in Zoolander 2), but: â€œIâ€™m much more proactive with visual arts and writing, my notebook and little projects.â€\\x9d Of the projects that reach the public, most could charitably be classed as divisive. There are paintings: one of the cast of Seinfeld on the set of Wheel of Fortune, being painted, nude, by He-Man. Thereâ€™s The Wrong Ferrari, a Dadaist knockabout written on ketamine with Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches, shot entirely on iPhones. Most notorious is the Pizza Underground, his Velvet Underground tribute act that replaces the original lyrics with pizza puns (Iâ€™m Waiting for Delivery Man, Take a Bite of the Wild Slice). At Nottingham Rock City, the band were pelted with beer and booed off stage as he played a kazoo solo. They cancelled their European dates, citing a â€œcheesemergencyâ€\\x9d. My question about all this is: what the hell? â€œItâ€™s one of those good ideas you have when youâ€™re drunk, and you wake up and forget about it. But weâ€™re taking it to the end of the joke. We have an album coming out, a vinyl pressing with a childrenâ€™s choir, a symphony orchestra. Weâ€™re giving it away, our gift to the world.â€\\x9d Does he still find it funny? â€œOf course I find it funny! We rhyme mushrooms with mushrooms, come on. Itâ€™s the same joke, relentlessly. Like, theyâ€™re really doing this?â€\\x9d Culkin enjoys the absurdity his fame bestows. But scrutiny has its downside. In New York, he takes walks at 4am to avoid harassment. On YouTube, one can find clips of him being harassed by wannabe-paps with smartphones. In 2012, photographs of him looking gaunt, almost transparent, set tabloids aflame with stories he was addicted to heroin and oxycodone, following the breakdown of his relationship with Mila Kunis. Given his friendship with Adam Green and Pete Doherty â€“ as well as a previous arrest for possession of marijuana, Xanax and clonazepam â€“ it seemed plausible. Were people right to be worried? â€œNot necessarily. Of course, when silly stuff is going on â€“ but no, I was not pounding six grand of heroin every month or whatever. The thing that bugged me was tabloids wrapping it all in this weird guise of concern. No, youâ€™re trying to shift papers.â€\\x9d Is there a story there he might want to tell one day, on his own terms? â€œPerhaps.â€\\x9d Whatever his recreational habits, Iâ€™m surprised by how unscrewed-up Macaulay Culkin is. Plans for the summer mainly involve roadying for Har Mar Superstar and Green (with whom he has another lo-fi film out, Aladdin). â€œHome is where my boots are. Iâ€™m a big fan of jumping on peopleâ€™s tourbuses, making myself useful, doing load-ins and outs. I do everything except the merch table. I tried that, but ... we didnâ€™t sell anything.â€\\x9d He has directionless days. He sleeps in, stays up late, indulges immature humour, bounces around with bad-influence friends. In short, heâ€™s enjoying the adolescence that celebrity stole from him. Ironically, his personal problems and turbulent relationship with the media have also given him a pretty grown-up perspective. Not a bad epilogue for a child star. â€œItâ€™s allowed me to become the person I am, and I like me, so I wouldnâ€™t change a thing. Not having to do anything for my dinner, financially, lets me treat every gig like itâ€™s the last.â€\\x9d He laughs, and this time addresses himself in the second person. â€œIf it is, Iâ€™d think: Culkin, you had a good run.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'How to stop teenagers sexting Jeremy Hunt has proposed a ban on sexting for under 18s. As any reasonable person might have predicted, this has been met with a great deal of criticism. Most of the arguments appear to be based on the technical practicalities, given how Hunt never truly explained how tech companies are supposed to filter specific types of messages on countless platforms and devices based on date of birth. However, an even bigger hurdle would be the sex drive of teenagers themselves. One time when I was in school, weâ€™d heard that someone had abandoned a pornographic magazine in a nearby field (for any teenagers reading this, this was a common phenomenon in the era when porn had to be printed). So, obviously, we set off to find it. Took a few hours but it was eventually spotted in a ditch. It ended with us just staring at it for a while, focussed on cheaply-printed images of naked breasts, spattered with mud, rainwater and animal effluent (I hope nobody developed any weird fetishes as a result of this, but you never know). About 10 young guys, spending hours climbing hills and trudging through bogs, all for the mere possibility of seeing images of exposed female flesh. These are the sort of lengths teenagers will go to for even the slightest sexual stimulation, so the idea of some remote authority figure saying â€œstop thatâ€\\x9d making them reconsider their actions is ludicrous in the extreme. This isnâ€™t meant to ignore the issue. Teenage sexting is obviously prevalent, and we have no real idea how this affect long-term psychosexual development; weâ€™ve never had a generation of humans who had such easy access to sexual material at such a young age before. And some studies suggest that the adolescent brain, which is still forming, is more prone to addictive behaviour as areas like the prefrontal cortex, responsible for critical thinking and impulse control, arenâ€™t â€œfully formedâ€\\x9d yet. But studies like this, and the general attitude that they inform (and that informs them in turn) do come in for criticism. Our society often has a questionable, unfair view of adolescents, regarding them with suspicion, as unable to think for themselves, minimising their achievements and so on. Theyâ€™re often treated more like unpredictable pets than, you know, people. Studies focussing on the â€œimmaturityâ€\\x9d of the adolescent brain regularly back up this stance and inform policy, despite the fact that thereâ€™s relatively little evidence directly linking brain developments and observed behaviours. This could be seen as inconsistent. If your argument is that adolescent brains arenâ€™t fully developed so they shouldnâ€™t be trusted with anything potentially harmful, then technically our brains donâ€™t fully â€œmatureâ€\\x9d until our mid-20s. Logically then, every important decision and possibly harmful action (smoking, drinking, driving etc.) should be restricted to those over 25. Unless Iâ€™ve missed a major announcement, this hasnâ€™t happened. Another argument is that this lack of impulse control in adolescents isnâ€™t a flaw, it evolved for a reason. Risk taking behaviour rises markedly during adolescence, and falls again into mature adulthood. While this obviously has dangerous implications, it can also lead to positive things like meeting more people, establishing relationships (asking someone out is always a big risk), achieving new experiences and knowledge, and many other things that make you a better person and improve your long term prospects. And then thereâ€™s the adolescent sex drive. Teenagers are going through an intense and confusing hormonal onslaught as it is. Testosterone and oestrogen induce the physical sexual changes experienced by men and women respectively, but these also increase our sex drive in the brain. Sex is an extremely powerful motivator at the best of times, but people often overlook how complex it is. Youâ€™ve got the basic, animal â€œurgesâ€\\x9d that lead to sex drives, but also the more sophisticated aspects. Thereâ€™s the intimacy aspect (sex is a big part of relationships, something else our brains seek out), the social aspect (men who have a lot of sex are praised for their virility and prowess, womenâ€¦ not so much), and countless other influences. All of these would be even more potent for a developing, adolescent brain. Despite this, most research focuses purely on the timing of onset of adolescent sexuality, which isnâ€™t especially helpful. So, technical challenges aside, the idea of a ban on sexting is still ridiculous. Youâ€™ve got millions of individuals with an increased sex drive, reduced self-control, a fondness for risk and an established aversion to authority figures. Even if you could work out a way to ban sexts among teenagers (one clueless politician versus an angry generation that have been immersed in technology since birth? Could happen, I guess) that wouldnâ€™t solve the problem at all, would almost certainly just result in more teenagers being punished for questionable reasons. As sex-blogger Girl On The Net so eloquently puts it: Short of locking them in boxes with no wifi connection, there is no technical â€œsolutionâ€\\x9d that will prevent kids from sexting any more than you could have prevented a younger version of me from getting touched up behind the bike sheds at school. Whatâ€™s more Iâ€™d argue that â€œstopping kids from sextingâ€\\x9d is a misguided goal in the first place. We shouldnâ€™t be treating sex like itâ€™s a monster thatâ€™s trying to eat our young people: itâ€™s a very common part of life, and blanket bans are a poor alternative to proper sex education and guidance. Thereâ€™s definitely a discussion to be had about teenagers engaging in potentially harmful, destructive sexual behaviours, but dealing with this would be a lot easier if policies around sexual issues were consistent and logical, and thatâ€™s far from the case. The UK age of consent is 16, but the texting plans would apply to anyone under 18? So you can have sex with your partner but canâ€™t mention it on your phones afterwards? Sex suffuses practically every aspect of our media, bare flesh is common in everyday advertising, but teenage girls get kicked out of school for wearing too-short skirts. Is it any wonder teenagers are confused about sex and attempts to educate them are hit-and-miss? Logically, the best way to get teenagers to be more diligent about sex would be if those in authority started treating them like actual people with thoughts and drives and needs of their own, rather than horny dogs humping your trouser leg needing a tap on the nose to â€œlearn their placeâ€\\x9d. Hereâ€™s hoping that might happen at some point. Dean Burnett isnâ€™t a sex guru but heâ€™s seen it on the telly. His book The Idiot Brain, is available now in the UK, USA, Canada and many other countries.',\n",
              "  'A new year that changed me: realising I wanted to live, and giving up heroin It was the looks of contempt that did it. I didnâ€™t normally spend new year with my parents and sisters, but that year I did. I had nowhere else to go really as Iâ€™d pretty much run out of friends, and time with my family seemed marginally preferable to time on my own. To be clear; this wasnâ€™t about them, it was about me. Iâ€™d been a heroin addict for 10 years and my life was a mess. Iâ€™d done next to nothing other than a few dead-end jobs from which I was invariably sacked and I got by on a round of handouts and petty crime. Lying had become second nature; Iâ€™d been to rehab five years previously and sworn blind to everyone that I was off the smack, but the truth was Iâ€™d never been clean for more than a few days. My life had been reduced to the getting and using of heroin. Not that I turned down booze or other drugs; it was just that none of them hit the same sweet spot of nullification. That feeling of feeling nothing. That new year, though, I was forced to feel my shame. Iâ€™d arrived â€“ late, of course, what junkie ever arrives anywhere on time? â€“ and my parents had made a great show of welcoming me. Several years later they told me one of the reasons they had always been so pleased to see me was because my arrival was proof that I wasnâ€™t dead. I kissed my mum hello and my dad offered me a drink. â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€\\x9d I said. â€œIâ€™ll get one myself.â€\\x9d I went into the kitchen, downed a tumbler full of scotch, before refilling the glass to a more acceptable level and going off to the living room to rejoin the rest of the family. Awkward doesnâ€™t begin to do justice to the misery that followed. My parents began, as they always did, by asking me what I had been up to. I came up with the usual hard luck lines of why what I had previously told them hadnâ€™t happened and how I was sure next year would be different. They sat there and nodded, desperate to believe me. My sisters remained impassive, barely even bothering to say hello. I canâ€™t remember the rest of the evening in detail, but if it ran anything like every other evening, it will have gone something like this. Every now and again I will have announced that I needed to go to the toilet and disappeared for the best part of 20 minutes to shoot up some smack. Iâ€™d have then wandered back into the living room as if Iâ€™d only been gone for a couple of minutes and slump, barely conscious, back into the chair. This would have been repeated several times until the clock ticked round to midnight â€“ the chimes of freedom that allowed everyone to slope off to bed after the briefest â€œhappy new yearâ€\\x9d and to escape the horrors of the preceding hours. What I do remember is the contempt in my sistersâ€™ eyes. Normally, nothing could touch me when I was out of it on heroin; it was as if there was a protective barrier between me and the world. If people didnâ€™t like me I seldom noticed, and if I did I wasnâ€™t that bothered. But that New Yearâ€™s Eve my sisters broke through my shield and their eyes had seen my soul. Or what was left of it. They may not have known what exactly was wrong with me or just how bad a state I was in, but they had seen enough to give up on me. Loving me had become just too painful; disgust was all that remained. The details of the following morning are equally fuzzy, but something had changed. I couldnâ€™t get my sisters out of my head. Even more striking was the revelation that no matter how much they hated me, it was nothing compared to how much I hated myself. Like most junkies, I often talked to other junkies about how I was going to give up smack. But also like most junkies, I never got round to doing more than getting the occasional methadone script to tide me over a few days of trying not to take quite as much heroin as usual. It was a depressing cycle of failure that only served to reinforce my self-loathing. Yet that New Yearâ€™s Eve had been a game changer, because it was also the moment I realised that I wanted to live more than I wanted to die. It took time. Junkies seldom rush anything and I continued to use, with the overdoses becoming more frequent. But within two months I was in rehab, and this time it worked. That was back in 1987. Fingers crossed in March this year I will have been clean and sober for 30 years.',\n",
              "  'Bridget Jones is a glorious emissary from a better age Trying to hate the third Bridget Jones film is like trying to sulk while a toddler is tickling you: if itâ€™s hard to take against RenÃ©e Zellweger in any guise, itâ€™s simply not viable when sheâ€™s lip-syncing to House of Pain. As she paces round her yard of failures, and ends â€œat least Iâ€™m finally thin,â€\\x9d itâ€™s hard to take against that too. Comic talent leaps from the screen like frogs out of a box. Why was I even trying to hate it? Because it was Bridget Jones, and in the 1990s, thatâ€™s what we did. Before the first film we complained about the column, then the book, on feminist grounds. Finally, a character had arrived who didnâ€™t embody a prissy femininity of self-control, but in its place was a constant hum of trivia and calories and incompetence. She couldnâ€™t do anything. She couldnâ€™t make soup, she couldnâ€™t stay upright, she had all the agency and independence of a gosling, she was always at her most loveable when she was showing her knickers. It was as though there was so much fear in rejecting the classic female ideal of decorum that we had to crawl on our hands and knees to be accepted some other way. Inconveniently, she was often very funny. But funny could wait until weâ€™d smashed the patriarchy. That was wrong. No, let me try that again. I was wrong. The self-abasement and the humour were inextricable, and contained a subtle liberation that it was a big mistake to undervalue. Big mistake, to quote another politically problematic but deceptively important film: huge. The first Bridget Jones film came out in 2001, by which time there was a kind of meta-disapproval for Zellweger, as the envoy of US body fascism trying to ape British slatternliness. How can you tear down the cultural constraint of female perfectionism with a heroine who battles constantly with her thighs and drinks wine in pints, and not at least check first whether or not Kate Winslet is available? The distinction between herself as an actor and herself qua casting decision seemed lost on Zellweger, who was extremely vexed at the column inches devoted to her appearance, and has remained so. In retrospect, I can see why. Itâ€™s hard not to take things personally when theyâ€™re literally all about your person. But seeing the third film makes me realise how much there is to miss about the 1990s politically. Bridget is now 43, and gets accidentally pregnant after two one-night stands, too close together to figure out whose child it is. I probably just about have it in me not to say who the father is, between Colin Firthâ€™s Mark and Patrick Dempseyâ€™s Jack, but otherwise take it as read that this piece will be riddled with spoilers. Immediately, the film made me miss sex-positive feminism. There was a time, towards the end of the last century, when we rejected the word â€œslutâ€\\x9d not because it was victim-blaming but because there was no victim. The charge of sluttishness simply made no sense. A woman might choose to get drunk and have sex with a stranger, and it might not be a cry for help or a violation, it might not have meaning, she might not have low self-esteem, she might just feel like it. She might be charting the exhilarating waters of her own sexual destiny or she might just be passing the time. She couldnâ€™t be made to feel ashamed, not because the Daily Mail didnâ€™t try, but because shame is a two-way street and she didnâ€™t have it in her. Sex didnâ€™t have to be a transaction, with a winner and a loser (or two losers), as it is in Girls; it didnâ€™t even have to be an idealised transaction resulting in mutually satisfied participants, in the manner of Sex and the City. It could exist entirely outside the framework of investment and return, use and exploitation, in the space we used to call life. I miss the jokes. At one point in Bridget Jonesâ€™s Baby, Bridgetâ€™s gay friend announces heâ€™s adopting, and says: â€œWeâ€™re having a baby. A gaybyâ€\\x9d. That joke could only be made because it was seeded in a more ludic time. You wouldnâ€™t write that in a story first conceived today, because someone would think it infantilised same sex relationships, and someone else would think it implied that gay parents tried to preach homosexuality to their children, and some other someone would think it sexualised babies. Which may not sound like a huge loss, because itâ€™s just a piece of silly wordplay, but it is a loss: the ability to take a joke is a fundamental, perhaps defining, component of social legitimacy and confidence. When we all have to be as sensitive as our most sensitive ally, we cram into an ever tighter cultural corner, pearl-clutching, offence-taking, acting out the humourlessness of which liberals were always mischievously accused. And I miss Emma Thompson; or rather, I miss the kinds of roles for which only Emma Thompson will do, caustic, intelligent, sceptical, warm. Try to imagine Theresa May explaining to Emma Thompson why she needed grammar schools, or a van telling immigrants to go home or face arrest; itâ€™s really enjoyable. More than any of that, I miss fecklessness, the ability to accept error as part of the human condition, without trying to stratify it by class or gender and write it off as the kind of thing only undesirable people are capable of. What contemporary political narrative would Bridget Jones fit into, in her current situation? Sheâ€™s not a scrounger; sheâ€™s not a troubled family; sheâ€™s not a benefits cheat. (She probably is, for a time, a drain on the NHS.) But nor is she a hard-working family, or a striver. Sheâ€™s not having a baby because she planned it, or can afford it, or has a brilliant maternity package, or lives near an outstanding primary school. She couldnâ€™t begin to justify her decision, couldnâ€™t even dignify it with the word, itâ€™s more of a happenstance. She doesnâ€™t match any of the criteria of a decent citizen in our current politics; but thatâ€™s a fault in the politics, which is kept afloat by a po-faced self-righteousness that canâ€™t brook a joke in case empathy and fellowship come rushing in alongside it. The real work of building a â€œcountry that works for allâ€\\x9d consists not of standing greyly by and intoning it, but of being able to see a person in wildly inauspicious circumstances, entirely of their own making, and feeling for them; knowing it could be you; wanting to help. That was the subversive element of Bridget Jones â€“ her every pratfall built a deeper collective bond and made a narrow, judgmental, me-first worldview more absurd, more laughable, more impossible to maintain. She returns, like Batman, just when we need her most.',\n",
              "  \"With Trump and Tillerson, Abbott's 'shirtfront' comment looks even sillier President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s foreign policy will bring together the two most important trends sweeping world politics. One is the surge of anti-establishment consciousness across the west. Trumpâ€™s pick for secretary of state, Washington outsider and friend of Russia, Rex Tillerson, is the latest manifestation of this. The other is the rise of Asia after half a millennium of relative stagnation. For Australia, this is an opportunity for an overdue recalibration of our foreign policy thinking, one that harnesses the benefits of our diverse population and puts people first. The pick of Tillerson is the strongest indication yet that Trump will defy establishment hawks and run foreign policy his own way. A Trumpian foreign policy has been touted by his supporters as a course-correction towards prioritising ordinary Americans at home, and away from maintaining the â€œliberal international orderâ€\\x9d. This order, epitomised by hawkish liberal Hillary Clinton, is increasingly attacked by the right as charity to undeserving foreigners, and has long been critiqued by the left as imperialism in the service of global capitalists. The maintenance of this order has led to massive military spending in a period when middle class Americans have seen no real growth in income. The American people, including those who opposed Trump, were increasingly dissatisfied with the foreign policy their government had prosecuted. John Howard would have probably called them anti-American. In practice, noting Trumpâ€™s trademark inconsistency, his changes will likely mean less influence by traditional â€œpro-warâ€\\x9d special interest groups and wins for a new group of private sector elites in the presidentâ€™s inner-circle. Incoming secretary of state Tillerson, alongside chief strategist Steve Bannon and his â€œeconomic nationalistsâ€\\x9d faction, and Russia-friendly national security adviser Mike Flynn, constitute formidable opposition to the hawkish Republican establishment. For ordinary Americans, however, all this means is potential slight, short-term gains for workers in certain industries. What it means for Australia The Trumpian paradigm is straightforward and realist, at least overtly: if you mess with us, youâ€™re a bad guy, to be bombed (Islamic terrorists) or slapped with tariffs (China), and everyone else (from Australia to Russia) can sink or swim on their own. This increases the urgency of the challenges Canberra already faces, like how to respond to an ascendant China and a multipolar Asia. Less US interest in regional disputes like the South China Sea reduces the risk of a great power war and relieves pressure on Australia to â€œpick a sideâ€\\x9d. However, a potential US trade war with China will harm sectors of our economy and would remove one of the biggest barriers to a real war between the superpowers. Furthermore, US withdrawal from the region may cause countries like Japan, and even India, to begin a military buildup, triggering an arms race in Asia. At this juncture, Australia has a historic opportunity to rethink its foreign policy. For decades our leaders provided rhetorical support for almost all US foreign policies, including those that did not prioritise the Australian peopleâ€™s interests. Trump seems to envision a USA that is much closer to the way many countries in our region already view the US: as a powerful state pursuing its own interests. Unfortunately, Australiaâ€™s politicians had long ignored this view. Our relationship with Washington had been considered, to quote Paul Keating, as â€œsacramentâ€\\x9d. The Trumpian foreign policy is a massive smackdown to the rightwingers in Australian politics and their Howard era â€œdeputy sheriffâ€\\x9d mentality, a doctrine that increased our risk of attack by terrorists. Our erstwhile approach of being â€œmore Catholic than the Popeâ€\\x9d as seen by former prime minister Tony Abbottâ€™s unfulfilled pledge to â€œshirtfrontâ€\\x9d Vladimir Putin, and other inflammatory rhetoric that saw us excluded from talks on Syria (harming our anti-terror efforts), will no longer suffice now that the next US president has moved to rapprochement with Russia. With an America-firster in the White House, Australia needs to take a sober look at our US relationship, pros and cons. The Allianceâ€™s key benefits include that Washington is bound into consulting on mutual threats. Our security ties provide access to US intelligence resources, military technology, preferred status in equipment purchasing, access to training and combined exercises. This relationship increases the likelihood of US protection, but does not guarantee it. Washington has, understandably, always looked out for itself first, and under Trump this will be more pronounced. Canberra should do likewise, seeing our two nations as rational actors working together where our interests converge. Trumpâ€™s election should force us to grasp the full reality of Asiaâ€™s strategic ascendance, not just its economic growth. Being seen as a rusted on US ally weakens our leverage in both Washington and Beijing. We must dare to imagine potential future scenarios where China is as powerful as the US in Asia, and where the American people and political class are unwilling to go to war over Asia with a nuclear-armed opponent. Is it worth damaging ties with Beijing because our â€œvaluesâ€\\x9d differ, when these values havenâ€™t stopped us maintaining ties with other non-democratic states? These challenges require a careful â€œtriple bottom lineâ€\\x9d approach which assesses interests, values and public opinion. Publicly admonishing Beijing over the South China Sea while acquiescing to breaches of international law like Bushâ€™s Iraq invasion fails to stand up to any of these tests. Trumpâ€™s anti-establishment win also reminds us not to exclude ordinary people from the discussion. More so than any other policy area, foreign policy has long been considered sacrosanct and above the uncouthness of public debate. But with the geopolitical ground shifting, the conversation must expand beyond Hugh White columns in newspapers and into mainstream political discussions. This includes harnessing Australiaâ€™s growing multicultural diversity. Should we still prioritise the â€œAnglosphereâ€\\x9d due to cultural ties as some Liberal politicians prefer, when over 12% of Australians have Asian ancestry and Asians are among the fastest growing migrant groups? Policymaking needs to be diversified both demographically and professionally. Unlike the US, where a revolving door between government, academia and business spurs innovation, Australiaâ€™s foreign policy establishment has long been a closed shop with the majority of entrants joining at the graduate level. Thankfully this is beginning to change. When I first joined the foreign service, I was one of only a few graduates who was both a migrant and from a working class, heavily multicultural suburb. Growing up in Dandenong and observing the cultures and inter-group dynamics between the Chinese, Serbs, Afghans etc. gave me a foundation for understanding the world of international relations. With Trumpâ€™s America accelerating the emergence of a multipolar world no longer dominated by European-heritage countries, Australia needs to look right here, to our own diverse population when shaping our future global direction. Trumpâ€™s rise, both through its implications and as a symbolic example, should teach politicians to put Australiaâ€™s people first in foreign policy, and encourage everyone to contribute to the discussion.\",\n",

Asked if she could confirm Flowersâ€™ attendance, she said: â€œNo, I canâ€™t confirm that and I canâ€™t believe how easily the Clinton campaign was baited.â€\\x9d Flowers, she said, â€œhad not been formally invited. I donâ€™t expect her to be there as a guest of the Trump campaign. â€œIt seems odd,â€\\x9d she added, that the Clinton campaign would give the story â€œlife and breathâ€\\x9d. Speaking to ABCâ€™s This Week, Conway repeated her contention that the Clinton campaign had started the row by inviting Cuban and elaborated on her claim about â€œbaitingâ€\\x9d, criticising the release of a statement on the subject on Saturday night. In that statement, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said: â€œHillary Clinton plans on using the debate to discuss the issues that make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. Itâ€™s not surprising that Donald Trump has chosen a different path.â€\\x9d Conway also repeated that Flowers had not been invited by the campaign, but added that she could be at the debate â€œas a paying member of the publicâ€\\x9d. On Fox News Sunday, Trump vice-presidential pick Mike Pence was more emphatic, saying: â€œGennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night.â€\\x9d Pence also attacked Cuban, who owns the NBAâ€™s Dallas Mavericks, saying he had â€œbeen out there saying some pretty tough stuff about my running mate â€¦ [He] knows about as much about national security as I do about professional basketballâ€\\x9d. On NBCâ€™s Meet the Press, retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser, held the line, saying Cuban was â€œnot a legitimate personâ€\\x9d. Flynn was less decisive about Flowers, saying only: â€œWeâ€™ll wait to see what happens tomorrow night.â€\\x9d Following Conway on CNN, Mook said the Flowers story was indicative of Trumpâ€™s temperamental instability and unsuitability for the White House. â€œNobody knows which Donald Trump is going to show up to this debate,â€\\x9d he said, â€œand in fact his erratic temperament has been discussed a lot around the debate, and I would argue that is why he is not fit and prepared to be president.â€\\x9d Conway said Trump â€œhad no planâ€\\x9d to attack Clinton in the debate about her husbandâ€™s infidelity, echoing remarks by the candidate himself earlier this week, and said: â€œMr Trump will answer the questions as asked by moderator Lester Holt.â€\\x9d Trumpâ€™s frequent attacks on other people were â€œcounterpunchesâ€\\x9d to attacks on him, she said, as he had â€œa right to defend himselfâ€\\x9d. Mook said: â€œI think the fact that Trump is spending the hours before the debate on this sort of thing is indicative of the kind of leader and the kind of president he would be. Itâ€™s a warning sign before the debate has even started about [Trumpâ€™s] bullying tactics that make him unfit to be president.â€\\x9d Clinton would seek in the debate an â€œunfiltered opportunityâ€\\x9d to address the American people, Mook said, repeating campaign claims that the Democratic candidate would not be treated fairly by moderators and saying he was â€œvery concerned that Donald Trump will be graded on a curveâ€\\x9d and allowed to â€œfly off the handleâ€\\x9d rather than address specific plans and policies. Speaking to ABC, he added that the campaign did not want Clinton â€œto have to play traffic cop â€¦ having to spend the whole debate correcting the recordâ€\\x9d. On CNN, Conway refused to reveal what was said between Trump and the Texas senator Ted Cruz, who endorsed the nominee on Friday after having held out since a bruising primary in which Trump labelled him â€œLyinâ€™ Tedâ€\\x9d, was critical of Cruzâ€™s wifeâ€™s looks and linked his father to the assassination of John F Kennedy. â€œI can tell you we are thrilled to have the endorsement of Senator Cruz,â€\\x9d she said. â€œTogether [he and Trump] really do represent a large part of the Republican party.â€\\x9d Speaking in Austin, Texas, on Saturday, Cruz said his decision was rooted in the need to stop Clinton becoming president, but he refused to say if Trump was fit for the job. Bill Clinton initially denied Flowersâ€™ 1992 claim that they had had a long affair, but admitted in a 1998 deposition in a sexual harassment suit that he had a single sexual encounter with Flowers. In 1999, Flowers opened a defamation suit against Hillary Clinton and two Clinton aides, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. It was eventually dismissed. News of Flowersâ€™ possible attendance at the first debate came nine years after she told the Associated Press â€œI canâ€™t help but want to support my own genderâ€\\x9d and â€œI donâ€™t have any interest whatsoever in getting back out there and bashing Hillary Clinton.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  \"'Itâ€™s pretty small': Trump's left hand on display for all to judge in New York Donald Trumpâ€™s ailing presidential campaign suffered yet another blow on Wednesday, when the size of his hands â€“ a recurring, sensitive issue for the 70-year-old â€“ was made public. An imprint of Trumpâ€™s left hand was found on display at Madame Tussaudâ€™s New York wax museum by the Hollywood Reporter. Using a measuring apparatus, the Reporter found the hand to be a mere 7.25 inches â€“ compared to the average male hand size of 7.44 inches. The revelation threatens to further destabilize Trumpâ€™s efforts to be president. Notoriously thin-skinned â€“ he most recently insulted the Muslim parents of an American war hero â€“ Trump has been insisting he has â€œnormalâ€\\x9d hands for years. The furore regarding the self-described billionaireâ€™s appendages even spilled over into a Republican presidential debate in March, when Trump inferred his hand size did not mean he had a small penis. Whether that is accurate or not, on Wednesday afternoon some Madame Tussaudâ€™s attendees were shocked as they compared their hands to Trumpâ€™s. â€œItâ€™s pretty small,â€\\x9d said Claire Severson, 22. â€œItâ€™s about the same size as mine and I have a small hand. Itâ€™s tiny.â€\\x9d Severson, who looked to be around 5ft 7in tall, declared herself â€œrather surprisedâ€\\x9d at the size of Trumpâ€™s hand, which is cast in bronze. The good news for Trump, who trailed Clinton by nine points in a CNN/ORC poll released Monday, is that Severson said hand size would not influence her decision at the ballot box. â€œIâ€™m not going to vote for him,â€\\x9d she said. â€œBut not due to the size of his hand.â€\\x9d The controversy over the size of Trumpâ€™s hands dates back to the 1980s, when journalist Graydon Carter referred to the billionaire as a â€œshort-fingered vulgarianâ€\\x9d in Spy magazine. In 2015 Carter revealed that Trump has been sporadically sending him pictures of his hands for the last 25 years, insisting they are not as small as Carter made out. The bronze model of Trumpâ€™s hand is located near the exit of Madame Tussaudâ€™s, opposite a penny-pressing machine. It is displayed next to a picture of a stern-looking Trump. As visitors flowed out of the wax museum only a few noticed the exhibit. â€œOh, look itâ€™s this asshole,â€\\x9d said Maribel Ocampo, a 39-year-old New York City resident. Ocampo, a 5ft tall woman, placed her hand over that of the 6ft 2in Trump. Hers was slightly smaller. â€œTheyâ€™re very feminine,â€\\x9d she noted of Trumpâ€™s hands. â€œTheyâ€™re the size of a regular-size female. If I were normal size theyâ€™d be bigger.â€\\x9d Ocampo described Trump, who has filed for bankruptcy four times, as â€œa racist and a misogynistâ€\\x9d who had â€œno proper way of talking to peopleâ€\\x9d, yet like Severson, she said the size of Trump hands would not play a part in her vote. â€œI donâ€™t care if he had big hulk hands,â€\\x9d she said, referring to the large, green alter ego of scientist Bruce Banner in the Marvel Comics series The Incredible Hulk. â€œI still wouldnâ€™t vote for him.â€\\x9d Ismael Gutierrez, a 24-year-old student, was also taken aback by dimensions of Trumpâ€™s hand. â€œNo way,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThat canâ€™t be.â€\\x9d Gutierrezâ€™s hand was roughly the same size Trumpâ€™s, although at 5ft 4in, he is almost a foot shorter. â€œA guy that tall, I find that weird,â€\\x9d Gutierrez said, although he did sound a more encouraging note for the presidential candidate. â€œYou canâ€™t really judge a man by his hand,â€\\x9d he noted. â€œThis doesnâ€™t really have anything to do with running the country, the size of his hand.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Ted Cruz refuses to back Donald Trump and hints he could revive his campaign Ted Cruz refused to commit his support to Donald Trump as the Republican nominee on Tuesday, and did not rule out resurrecting his campaign for president despite having dropped out of the race last week. In an interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, the Texas senator said that picking a presidential candidate â€œis not a choice that we as voters have to make todayâ€\\x9d. His comments came as Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who suspended his own presidential bid in March, said he would support Trump as the nominee. During an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Rubio said he intended to stick to a pledge signed by all of the Republican candidates last year to back the eventual nominee. â€œI signed a pledge, put my name on it, and said I would support the Republican nominee and thatâ€™s what I intend to do,â€\\x9d Rubio said. Cruz appeared less bound by the pledge, which has already been discarded by former contenders Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham â€“ both of whom have come out against Trump despite his all but clinching the Republican nomination. Cruz pointed out there were still two months until the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and six months until the general election, saying â€œwe need to watch and see what the candidates say and doâ€\\x9d. Although Cruz had long committed to supporting the Republican nominee in the past, his tone changed after Trump repeatedly made personal attacks against Cruz and his family. The businessman branded his rival â€œLyinâ€™ Tedâ€\\x9d, threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€\\x9d on his wife while implying she was unattractive, and accused Cruzâ€™s father of involvement in the assassination of John F Kennedy. While Cruz once called Trump â€œa friendâ€\\x9d and â€œterrificâ€\\x9d, he held an abrupt press conference hours before ending his campaign at which he derided Trump as a â€œserial philandererâ€\\x9d, an â€œamoral pathological liarâ€\\x9d, and a â€œbraggadocious, arrogant buffoonâ€\\x9d. Nor would Cruz rule out returning to the campaign trail if â€œthereâ€™s a path to victoryâ€\\x9d. The Texas senator suspended his campaign after losing the Indiana primary on 3 May by a margin of 53%-37%, and said that with the loss he no longer saw a path to the Republican nomination. On Tuesday, Cruz told Beck: â€œIf that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.â€\\x9d However, Cruzâ€™s campaign had a well-organized effort to put his supporters into positions of power among Republican delegates, who will elect the partyâ€™s nominee at the national convention in Cleveland this July. This effort means that although Trump is the only candidate left in the Republican primary, Cruz supporters will have significant influence on the convention floor, and that his delegates will probably hold control of crucial committees, such as those that write the convention rules and design the partyâ€™s platform. Cruz made clear that a return to the trail was very unlikely, though he would not rule it out. â€œIâ€™m not holding my breath,â€\\x9d he said, in response to questioning about a primary election in Nebraska, also on Tuesday, that he was once expected to win. The Texas senator did dismiss the possibility of running as a third-party candidate or supporting a third-party alternative in November. â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s very likely,â€\\x9d he told Beck. â€œItâ€™s always talked about; I donâ€™t think itâ€™s something thatâ€™s likely to happen.â€\\x9d Cruzâ€™s statements followed Trumpâ€™s continued failure to unite the Republican party behind him. Two former presidents have said they will not back him and key party figures like the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, have declined to endorse him, at least for the present. The former reality television star is scheduled to meet Republican congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday, as part of his effort to heal the rifts within the party. Rubio said while he stood by his prior criticisms of Trump â€“ which included dubbing his former opponent â€œan erratic con artistâ€\\x9d â€“ Republican primary voters had made their choice clear. â€œMy differences with Donald â€“ both my reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him â€“ are well documented and they remain,â€\\x9d Rubio said. â€œBut Iâ€™m not going to sit here right now and become his chief critic over the next six months, because he deserves the opportunity to go forward and make his argument and try to win.â€\\x9d He added: â€œI know what I said during the campaign; I enunciated those things repeatedly. And voters chose a different direction. I stand by the things that I said.â€\\x9d Rubio nonetheless declined to offer Trump an explicit endorsement, hedging when asked if he planned to vote for the billionaire in November. â€œI intend to support the nominee,â€\\x9d Rubio said. Pressed again by the CNN host Jake Tapper on whether that meant casting a ballot in Trumpâ€™s favor, Rubio responded: â€œIâ€™m not voting for Hillary Clinton. Iâ€™m not throwing away my vote.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Steve Young obituary The singer and songwriter Steve Young, who has died aged 73 from a head injury sustained after a fall, won the admiration of critics and fellow artists in a recording career spanning almost 50 years, while remaining little known outside a hard core of appreciative fans. Nonetheless, he was influential in the country-rock movement of the 1960s and 70s, and was closely allied with the outlaw country movement, which introduced a defiant rockâ€™nâ€™roll attitude into Nashvilleâ€™s middle-of-the-road country music. Youngâ€™s best-known song is Seven Bridges Road, which has been covered by numerous artists including Joan Baez, Rita Coolidge, Iain Matthews and Dolly Parton. The song gave Young his closest brush with stardom when the Eagles released their live recording of it as a single in 1980. Their version (extracted from the Eagles Live concert album) reached 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also became a hit on the country charts. Other Young songs made famous by big-name artists were Montgomery in the Rain, which was recorded by Hank Williams Jr in 1977, and Lonesome, Onâ€™ry and Mean, the title song of the 1973 album by Waylon Jennings which helped to establish Jenningsâ€™s â€œoutlawâ€\\x9d credentials. Young was born in Georgia and spent his early years moving around Georgia and Alabama as his half-Cherokee father struggled to find work. He regarded Gadsden, Alabama â€“ where his maternal grandmother lived â€“ as the nearest thing he had to a home town. â€œMy father began sharecropping when he was 13 and his sister Eula, who worked with him, was 10,â€\\x9d Young recalled. â€œI was from a really dysfunctional family. My father would just disappear sometimes â€¦ He left us when I was very young.â€\\x9d Nonetheless, both his mother and father had an interest in country and gospel music, and the young Steve developed an ambition to become a musician. His mother eventually bought him a Gibson electric guitar. She remarried and moved, with her son, to Beaumont, Texas, where Steve graduated from high school (he was in the same class as the aspiring blues guitarist Johnny Winter). He played gigs in Texas before moving back to Alabama, but his fondness for playing politically charged folk songs, including some of Bob Dylanâ€™s, made him unpopular in the reactionary Deep South. Having received threats from the Ku Klux Klan, he fled to California with two local folk musicians, Richard Lockmiller and Jim Connor, who had a deal with Capitol Records as Richard & Jim. He played lead guitar in the Skip Battin Band (Battin would later join the Byrds) and joined Van Dyke Parks and Stephen Stills in the Gas Company. Then he was invited to join Stone Country, who recorded an album for RCA that brought Young to the notice of other record companies. He signed a solo deal with A&M and recorded his debut album, Rock Salt & Nails (1969); it comprised mostly cover versions, and featured two former member of the Byrds, Gene Clark and Gram Parsons, but also contained the first recording of Seven Bridges Road. Youngâ€™s evocative mix of country, gospel, folk and bluegrass styles was already forming. The album failed to sell, and Young, already tired of the music business, moved to San Francisco with his new wife, the folk singer Terrye Newkirk. He opened a guitar shop in San Anselmo, where his customers included Jerry Garcia and Van Morrison. However, Reprise records lured him with a new deal, and sent him to Nashville to record the album Seven Bridges Road (1972). This too was a flop, despite some enthusiastic reviews. Now with a young son, Young moved to Nashville, but lack of money and his escalating alcohol consumption prompted him to separate from Terrye in 1974 (they later divorced). In 1975-76, he was filmed for the documentary Heartworn Highways, alongside other upcoming â€œoutlawâ€\\x9d performers including Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle, but the film was not released until 1981. Young scuffled a living as a travelling troubadour, when the opportunity arose making albums, which included Honky Tonk Man (1975) and two critically acclaimed albums for RCA, Renegade Picker (1976) and No Place to Fall (1978). These did not sell, driving Young into a pit of alcoholic gloom that took him into rehab at Meharry hospital, Nashville. After a reissue of Seven Bridges Road and a new album, To Satisfy You (1981), failed to ring the cash registers, Young was invited to tour Norway with the Jonas Fjeld Band, and made the album Look Homeward Angel (1986) for the Swedish label Mill Records. He moved to Austin, Texas and cut the album Solo/Live (1991) for Watermelon Records, followed by the studio album Switchblades of Love (1993), a collection of songs that proved Young was still potent creatively, if not financially. After releasing Primal Young (2000), he concocted a plan to re-record his back catalogue, since his rights to his original recordings were entangled with various record labels. This resulted in Songlines Revisited, Vol 1 (2005). His latest release was the live album Stories Round the Horseshoe Bend (2007). His son, Jubal Lee, survives him. â€¢ Steve Young, singer and songwriter, born 12 July 1942; died 17 March 2016',\n",
              "  'Donald Trump is a pretend populist â€“ just look at his economic policy When Donald Trump pitched an economic policy platform nakedly contrived to benefit other multi-millionaires to an assembled crowd in Detroit this Monday, it was quite a spectacle. If there was ever any doubt about the absurdity of the signifier of populism in American politics, it should have been dashed there and then. Whatâ€™s clear by now is that Donald Trumpâ€™s populist appeal is limited to a very specific populace, by design. The question of whether Trumpâ€™s support is predicated on race versus class isnâ€™t really a question anymore. Itâ€™s the kind of thing that can be tested with polls and multivariate regression models. Which is exactly what political scientist Philip Klinkner did, and found that, controlling for one another, pessimism about the economy doesnâ€™t predict support for Trump; resentment toward African Americans and Muslims does. Itâ€™s the reason why Trump wonâ€™t win over Sanders supporters: however much he invokes Nafta and the decline of manufacturing in the Midwest, as he did in his Detroit speech, trade just isnâ€™t as politically salient as he thinks. Most voters donâ€™t rank trade as a top issue. And most of Trumpâ€™s supporters care far more about immigration and terrorism, which makes his frequent racist and Islamophobic dog whistles far more effective at shoring up his base. There are, of course, many on the left who wish trade was more of a salient issue, just as many wish the US had stronger unions and an honest-to-God populist party. But given our history as a country founded on white supremacy, the dream of a kind of pure populism, unadulterated by racism and xenophobia, has always been elusive. Trumpâ€™s platform and rhetoric neatly dovetail with those of earlier American populist parties, the Know Nothings (for whom their alien scourge was Catholics) and the Peopleâ€™s Party (who called for restricting immigration in their founding document). Which is why it doesnâ€™t really matter that Trump gets so much wrong on economics. Just in this one speech, he asserted, without evidence, that the Department of Labor is misreporting unemployment figures, apparently confusing their U3 and U6 rates. He conflated retirees with people out of work. He used out-of-date census data to say that household income dropped $4,000 in 16 years, which is not true. He claimed a Congressional Budget Office report says â€œObamacare will cost the economy two million full-time jobs,â€\\x9d when the report says no such thing. He flat out made things up about Clintonâ€™s tax plan. He called for repealing an estate tax that affects only him and a handful of his richest peers, a display of self interest thatâ€™s so unabashed itâ€™s impressive. Make me president and Iâ€™ll end the tax on private jets and orange hair weaves. He can get all this wrong and it wonâ€™t matter. Just as it doesnâ€™t matter that a man who appears to use bankruptcy as a business model can claim to be a jobs candidate. Just as it didnâ€™t matter that the last movement to be called populist, the Tea Party, had average incomes well above the US median. Itâ€™s not about jobs and itâ€™s not about income. Even if it should be. To be sure, the Democratsâ€™ allergy to anything resembling class-based politics does much to enable Trump, and the continuation of a racialized populism largely divorced from economics. When Democrats say â€œmiddle classâ€\\x9d, they mean â€œworking classâ€\\x9d, and when Republicans say â€œworking classâ€\\x9d, they mean â€œwhite peopleâ€\\x9d. To be called working class in America means being an evangelical, being a gun owner, living in a rural area, not being black or Latino or Asian â€“ being, in other words, a typical Republican. So when Democrats flip flop on trade, and cozy up to Wall Street while keeping unions at arms length, who can blame Republicans for seizing an opportunity to fill the void? And the more Trumpâ€™s racialized populism alienates establishment Republicans, the more Clinton embraces them, trumpeting an elite Washington consensus that she is the only responsible candidate in the race. Which may be true. But if thereâ€™s anything that feeds the Trump phenomenon more than racial resentment, itâ€™s suspicion of an elite Washington consensus. When class disappears, being declared wrong by the whole of the establishment is enough to qualify you as a populist.',\n",

It is staggering that this government is choosing to ignore the problem. Is it acceptable that a third of children aged two to 15 are overweight or obese, putting them in danger of a variety of long-term health problems? The government had a fantastic opportunity to introduce tangible measures that could have initiated a culture change, but this strategy barely touched the surface. In 2013, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges produced a report, Measuring Up, that identified actions to tackle obesity, including banning junk food advertising before 9pm. We hear that restrictions on junk food advertising were originally included in the government strategy, so why were these and other measures supported by medical experts, removed? We know what the issues are and what needs to be done to make a difference, so what is stopping our politicians from getting things moving? If we donâ€™t act soon, the number of people living with illnesses caused by obesity will increase significantly and the financial burden on the NHS will continue to rise. We canâ€™t afford to wait any longer to confront this problem head on.

              "  \"Gillian Armstrong: I used to think, 'I did it, why can't all the other women?' The footpath outside the Orana Cinema in Busselton, Western Australia, is inscribed with names of Australian cinematic royalty: Jack Thompson. Hugo Weaving. David Wenham. Steve Bisley. Bryan Brown. Koko, the dog from Red Dog. It is somewhat striking that of the nine names that have been featured on CinefestOzâ€™s walk of fame, kelpies are better represented than women â€“ but this yearâ€™s festival brought with it a new addition: the acclaimed director Gillian Armstrong. Armstrong, the director of My Brilliant Career and Little Women, received CinefestOzâ€™s Screen Legend award at the festivalâ€™s gala event on Saturday night, making her the first woman to feature on the Busselton footpath. Speaking to Australia at one of the many boozy lunches that mark the festival, which is spread across the Margaret River wine region in Western Australia, the director expresses delight in the award: â€œNow people can walk all over me!â€\\x9d Armstrong knows well the hard-fought battle of gender diversity in the Australian film industry. A key supporter of Screen Australiaâ€™s Gender Matters initiative, she now sits on a panel, formed by the Australian Directors Guild, which oversees the programâ€™s Brilliant Careers branch, to create industry support for female directors. Armstrong was instrumental in getting the panel off the ground. When she saw an alarming report in the Australian Film Television and Radio Schoolâ€™s Lumina magazine, which indicated that only 16% of Australian directors working between 1970 and 2014 were women (though she herself would have estimated the figure closer to 40%), she lobbied Kingston Anderson, the chief executive of the Australian Directors Guild, to pay greater attention to gender diversity. â€œI said to Kingston, the ADG should get together and talk about this, because itâ€™s 50-50 going to film school, and in every short film award thereâ€™s women nominated. So whatâ€™s going wrong? Itâ€™s obvious that itâ€™s not a level playing field.â€\\x9d â€œThe film industry is not full of misogynists,â€\\x9d Armstrong says. â€œItâ€™s investors and producers risking money on a project, and underneath, no matter what they think, thereâ€™s a greater trust in the visual image of a guy with a baseball hat on.â€\\x9d She speculates also that the â€œboysâ€™ clubâ€\\x9d of the advertising industry in Australia is inhibiting the progress of female directors, with many ad agencies offering commercial opportunities to young guys headhunted out of film school, giving men the additional training and skills that lay the foundation for feature work. Armstrong credits an encounter with the Swedish Film Institute chief executive, Anna Serner, at a Toronto film festival event last year with informing her thinking on affirmative action in screen funding. In 2011 only 26% of Swedish government film funding went to female directors. Serner set out to achieve gender parity by the end of four years and reached her goal in two and a half. Armstrong has spent her career resisting being characterised as a â€œfeminist directorâ€\\x9d, a term that has dogged her since her acclaimed feature debut, My Brilliant Career, in 1979. â€œI got branded as a feminist director because it was a feminist story, but then thatâ€™s all I was offered: women achievers â€“ first woman to fly a plane, climb a mountain, ride a camel. I really fought against that labelling. I like to say my characters, male and female, are complicated, and not formulaic, and have depth and layers.â€\\x9d Searching out a change of subject, Armstrong fought to direct the 1982 musical Starstruck â€“ only to have it branded in the press as another Armstrong film about a â€œredhead who wants to be an achieverâ€\\x9d. One dismissal that particularly stung was an Australian notice given to her underrated 1987 heartbreaker High Tide, which stars Judy Davis as an itinerant showgirl alcoholic who re-encounters the daughter she gave up as an infant. â€œIt wasnâ€™t particularly the review,â€\\x9d Armstrong says, â€œit was a subeditor. Iâ€™ll remember this forever. The heading was â€˜Womanâ€™s Weepyâ€™. We were so upset.â€\\x9d One of Armstrong earliest works, the film she remembers as her first paid directorâ€™s job, was the short documentary Smoke and Lollies (1976): a portrait of three 14-year-old Adelaide schoolgirls, which was funded through the South Australian Film Corporation. Armstrong later extended this project, revisiting the three women across four subsequent documentaries, most recently Love, Lust and Lies in 2009. Though money for the film was allocated from a one-off program targeting female directors, Armstrong says she never felt that her career was made on the back of this diversity initiative â€“ after all, she characterises her early documentary work as a sidebar to her work in drama. But she acknowledges that her support for gender diversity-targeted funding is the result of an ongoing attitude shift. â€œI used to think, â€˜I did it, why canâ€™t all the other women?â€™ There were womenâ€™s initiatives and film groups, and I was actually a bit snobby about all that. I was like, well, youâ€™ve just to make a good film. Itâ€™s about your individual talent. Thatâ€™s why this has been a big change for me to speak out about it.â€\\x9d Armstrong says sheâ€™s heard the resentments of male directors who feel shut out from funding opportunities, but insists the industry is tough for anyone. â€œThe women that have got through over the years â€” Jane Campion and Jocelyn Moorhouse and so on â€” have worked 10 times as hard as the men. Theyâ€™re 10 times as good as the men. There wonâ€™t be equality until there are as many mediocre women directors as there are mediocre men.â€\\x9d\",\n",

Even with Unitedâ€™s sizeable fanbase, itâ€™s hard to see how any of this is worthy of wider interest than a slot on MUTV â€“ until it becomes apparent that Violletâ€™s career had an interesting second act: he moved to the US in 1969 and helped set up professional soccer there. It seems that Viollet took readily to life in the US, attempting to nurture homegrown talent alongside the starry imports, and he is spoken extremely fondly of by some of the former players whom he coached.

The list of more than 300 people also includes the bosses of dormant companies and a law firm that admits leaving the European Union could lead to a repeal of workersâ€™ rights. In a letter published in the Daily Telegraph, the business names claim Brexit would create more jobs, adding that the UKâ€™s competitiveness is being â€œundermined by our membershipâ€\\x9d. While signatories include heavyweight names, such as former HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan and the Wetherspoons chairman, Tim Martin, the leadership credentials of many others are less clear. Several preside over companies listed as â€œdormantâ€\\x9d by Companies House, while 23 are no longer active in the business world. One signatory is John Kersey, managing director of Preston hair salon Kersey Hairdressing, a business with net assets of Â£313. The list also includes the bosses of a clutch of firms with a history of facilitating tax avoidance. Robert Hiscox, honorary president of Hiscox Insurance, has been an outspoken defender of tax avoidance, having moved his company to Bermuda to slash its tax bill. Fellow signatory Martin Bellamy is the chairman and chief executive of Salamanca Group, which advertises â€œdynastic estate-planningâ€\\x9d for â€œultra-high net worth familiesâ€\\x9d. It offers advice on ways on offshore trusts and foreign investments for those keen on â€œpassing wealth or holding wealth for the next generationâ€\\x9d or those who want to keep their affairs â€œoutside the public domainâ€\\x9d. Salamanca also boasts of setting up offshore employee benefit trusts, a tax-efficient means of paying staff that the Treasury has said it wants to crack down on. Another signatory, Clive Thorne, is a partner at Wedlake Bell, a law firm that offers â€œimaginativeâ€\\x9d tax-planning strategies for business â€œboth onshore and offshoreâ€\\x9d. In an article on the companyâ€™s website, the firm admits that leaving the EU could result in a raft of workersâ€™ rights being abolished. â€œA number of key employment rights derive from EU legislation, in particular those relating to equal opportunities, holiday and working time. A departure from the EU could allow such legislation to be weakened or even repealed,â€\\x9d the article says. Labour MP Wes Streeting said the number of City financiers on the list showed the Brexit campaign was dominated by those who do not have ordinary workersâ€™ best interests at heart. â€œThese fat cats thrive off market disruption and insecurity,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut the disruption caused by our leaving the EUâ€™s single market would damage our economy to the tune of Â£4,300 a year per household, hitting working people the hardest. â€œThe facts are clear â€“ working people are better off in Europe. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put trade, jobs and rights at risk.â€\\x9d Some of the business leaders mentioned are not as senior as their titles might suggest. The letter is signed by David Sismey, a managing director at Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs, where many hundreds of middle-ranking staff have the same title. Another signatory is David Barnby, proprietor of Books2BuyBooks2Write and publisher of Hard Pounding: The Ukip Story, which includes a foreword by the partyâ€™s leader, Nigel Farage. A few of the firms appear concerned largely with the interests of the wealthy elite, such as private security firm Veritas International, whose chief executive Simon Rowland put his name to the letter. Veritas offers services such as armed guards for superyachts and private chaperones for children on their gap years.

              "  'The view on cyberbullying â€œIs it true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?â€\\x9d These are the questions Lucy Alexanderâ€™s open letter implored people to ask themselves before posting anything on social media. It was written after her son, Felix, killed himself, aged 17, after suffering years of cyberbullying and online abuse. This is something we should all reflect on as anti-bullying week begins on Monday. If we asked ourselves those questions more frequently, Prince Harry might not have felt forced to issue a statement about the treatment of his girlfriend, Meghan Markle, on social media and in the tabloid press. Fewer women might have to put up with vile misogynist online abuse, including rape and death threats. Fewer celebrities might see themselves mauled online in sidebars of shame. Cyberbullying can be particularly pernicious. Unrestricted to a particular location, it can be impossible to escape. The degree of anonymity afforded by the online world can embolden perpetrators to behave in ways they otherwise wouldnâ€™t. Perpetrators rarely witness the emotional reaction of their victims, dampening any empathy they might feel. And things can go viral fast, with potentially unlimited reach. Cyberbullying may be perpetrated thoughtlessly, but with devastating consequences. Lucy Nesbitt-Comaskey, a woman who was in Nice during the terrorist attack in July, gave an interview to Sky News while she was still in shock and made the mistake of talking about her shopping. She was torn apart by the tabloid press and called â€œthe most hated woman in Englandâ€\\x9d on Twitter. Tim Hunt, a Nobel laureate who made an ill-judged joke widely deemed to be offensive about women working in science, was subjected to a vicious social media campaign and forced to resign from his honorary professorship at University College London as a result. Cyberbullying is particularly pernicious when it comes to children, who lack the emotional resilience of adults. Children are increasingly inhabiting adult worlds online, with adult rules and few restrictions about what they can see and take part in. Most children have used at least one social network by the age of 10 and 52% of children age 8-16 have ignored Facebookâ€™s official minimum age of 13. Around one in four children have experienced some form of cyberbullying. These children are more likely to experience greater stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness, with one study suggesting the experience of being cyberbullied almost doubles the risk of children attempting suicide. This is not an issue that comes with a ready-made solution. Because it is about social behavioural norms â€“ what is and is not considered to be acceptable online â€“ it is something that can only be tackled through collective action. Parents often lack confidence in understanding how their children are using social media and need information and support in how to look for the warning signs their child is being bullied online. There should be more of a focus in the school curriculum on digital resilience â€“ developing young peopleâ€™s ability to deal with the risks they encounter online. Social media platforms could do much more to police their age restrictions meaningfully, ensure they have transparent, accessible and child-friendly systems for reporting online abuse and to positively promote support for those being cyberbullied. But we need to go beyond protecting young people by educating them about online risk â€“ we have a responsibility to teach children how to behave in a healthy and positive way online. For example, cybersmarties.com is a social network designed exclusively for primary-school children in Ireland. Users are authenticated as real children via their school. The network is designed to teach positive online behaviour for life, focusing on self-esteem and empathy. If the tech industry were really taking its responsibilities in this area seriously, it would be investing in similar initiatives that do not just teach children how to react to cyberbullying, but do more to discourage it in the first place. But there is perhaps little point in teaching children positive behaviour if, as adults, we are unwilling to model it ourselves. This is why Prince Harry is to be commended for speaking out against the harassment and bullying directed at Meghan Markle. We all have a responsibility to call out toxic bullying wherever it exists. â€œIs it kind?â€\\x9d Out of respect to Felix Alexander and other victims who have lost their lives to bullying, we should endeavour to ask ourselves this question before we post anything online.',\n",

              "  'Bank bosses will be forced to explain their actions every year, Malcolm Turnbull announces Bank bosses will have to front up to a parliamentary committee annually to explain their actions on interest rates and other behaviour under new rules announced by Malcolm Turnbull. The announcement came as Bill Shorten ramped up pressure for a royal commission into the banks, saying the industry would only respect the government if such an inquiry were implemented. The prime minister said the move would ensure the big banks were regularly accountable to elected members in the same way as the Reserve Bank or the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA). Turnbull said the banks would appear before the house committee on economics. This would avoid the scrutiny of the Senate where long time campaigners on bank behaviour, such as Nationals senator John Williams, Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and Laborâ€™s Sam Dastyari reside. Asked how the government would enforce the requirement to appear, Turnbull said â€œthe parliament has powers but they wonâ€™t be necessary, the banks will certainly appearâ€\\x9d. Steven Munchenberg, chief executive officer of the Australian Bankers Association (ABA), said while the federal government was entitled to the move, no other commercial businesses were required to justify pricing decisions in this way. â€œWe are confident banks can explain why the interest rates they set for borrowers are determined largely by the cost of funds and the pressures of a highly competitive market, not the Reserve Bank cash rate,â€\\x9d Munchenberg said. The requirement is only for the big four banks, Commonwealth, ANZ, National Australia Bank and Westpac â€“ though the committee does have the power to call anyone it chooses. Morrison, who spoke to the banks prior to the announcement, said the government was frustrated over the banks failure to pass on the interest rate cut and needed to do practical things to increase transparency. â€œClearly the intention of the Reserve Bank by cutting the rates was to see it pass through and follow through into the broader economy so obviously the extent to which that is not achieved actually frustrates the intention of the bank in making that decision and this is why we are frustrated,â€\\x9d Morrison said. The economics committee which will scrutinise the banks is yet to be reformed after the election. Turnbull said the process would provide ongoing accountability, rather than a one off investigation and report under a royal commission. But it is unclear whether the economics committee would have additional powers â€“ such as those available to a royal commission â€“ to compel witnesses, take evidence in camera, provide parliamentary privilege for witnesses or impose any penalties for non-compliance. â€œTheyâ€™ve got the opportunity to build confidence or they might, when they contemplate being more open and more accountable ... contemplate changing some policies and practices as a consequence,â€\\x9d Turnbull said. Shorten said the moved showed Turnbull was â€œin the pocket of the banksâ€\\x9d. â€œThere is nothing Mr Turnbull wonâ€™t do to protect the big banks from a Royal Commission,â€\\x9d Shorten said. â€œAfter giving them a $7bn tax cut, heâ€™s now inviting them to lunch in Canberra once a year so he can wag his finger at them. This is a friendly catch-up, not an investigation.â€\\x9d It comes after recently retired Reserve Bank board member John Edwards backed an inquiry into the banks and Turnbull called on the industry to pass on the full cut in the cash rate announced by the Reserve Bank earlier this week. â€œThe banks will only respect the government if the government is serious about a royal commission. Nothing less is going to make the banks respect the politicians,â€\\x9d Shorten said earlier in the day. Williams also renewed his call for a royal commission. â€œI have been seven years trying to fix up this industry and getting people to listen,â€\\x9d Williams said. â€œWe have been through the financial planning scandals, bad advice, Ponzi schemes, managed investment schemes, and even the life insurance industry is now under scrutiny. â€œBanks should realise they are in the public spotlight and they are doing little to instil public confidence in them. It seems to be profit before people. Iâ€™ve always supported a royal commission.â€\\x9d Williams was involved in a Senate inquiry into financial advisers at the Commonwealth Bank. NAB, ANZ and Westpac have faced rate rigging allegations. Asic is also investigating Comminsure â€“ the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank â€“ which has been accused of manipulating reports to avoid life insurance payouts to sick and dying customers. But new cabinet minister Matt Canavan, who had previously supported a royal commission, told Australia he no longer supported one, due to increased funding to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic). â€œThe government has responded with substantial investments in Asic and the powers that Asic has match or exceed those of any royal commission. A royal commission would be a distraction from Asic doing its job.â€\\x9d A royal commission can be established only by the government. It cannot be forced by legislation. As a result, Labor is considering using the parliamentary committee process to start an inquiry, with a view to pressuring the government if further evidence of bad banking practice is revealed. With the final Senate results now clear, the Senate crossbench includes four from Pauline Hansonâ€™s One Nation, three from Nick Xenophonâ€™s NXT party, Jacqui Lambie, Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm, Family Firstâ€™s Bob Day and Derryn Hinchâ€™s Justice Party. Whish-Wilson has also long campaigned on cleaning up the banking sector and has supported a royal commission, as does Lambie. But Whish-Wilson told Australia that Australia needed to move beyond Senate inquiries that deliver â€œheadlines for politicians and no changes to law and no justice for victims of these repeated white-collar crimesâ€\\x9d. â€œIf I was to support more Senate inquiries I would want to see [them] push the limits of what the Senate can do with its powers. â€œ[An inquiry] would need to be properly resourced and be willing to compel witnesses from within banks and financial services companies, starting with every single board member and working our way down through the CEO and management through to the workers.â€\\x9d Whish-Wilson would only support a Senate inquiry that not only compelled witnesses to appear but was properly resourced, as the previous Senate inquiry did not have the funds to hold banks to account. He also called for whistleblower protection. â€œI do not want to build up hopes of victims that the banks are going to be properly held to account and justice delivered, if that promise cannot be fulfilled,â€\\x9d Whish-Wilson said. Xenophon promised to work with Labor and the crossbench to keep pressure on the financial services industry. He supports the royal commission Labor proposes for the banking industry, but he says the approach through the parliament needs to be targeted. â€œWe need to have a compensation scheme of last resort,â€\\x9d he said. â€œHaving a royal commission for the sake of beating up the banks might make some people feel good, but it wonâ€™t do much good. It needs to be much more comprehensive than that. For instance, I think commercial banks that donâ€™t pass on the full interest rate cut should face a statutory obligation to take out a full-page newspaper ad to explain why.â€\\x9d But Steven Munchenberg, chief executive officer of the Australian Bankers Association (ABA), said a royal commission was unnecessary given the banks had already put measures in place. â€œThe industry has put in place initiatives to fix issues that Bill Shorten has said are the reasons for a royal commission,â€\\x9d Munchenberg said. â€œWe acknowledge there are problems but rather than having a royal commission we would like to fix them immediately.â€\\x9d Earlier this year, the industry established a number of initiatives in response to the scandals, promising to set up a consumer advocate, a register for individuals involved in past malpractice, protection for whistleblowers, an independent review of banking codes of practice, and an independent review of commissions for financial products. Munchenberg said the cash rate, which was cut by 0.25 percentage points to a record low of 1.5%, did not mirror banking costs. He said banks did increase deposit rates to attract more funds.',\n",

Itâ€™s impossible not to become immersed in the opening episode of the psychological thriller. Catherine Keener stars as Heidi Bergman, a caseworker from an experimental facility whoâ€™s helping soldiers integrate back into the community. Sheâ€™s focusing on Walter Cruz (Star Warsâ€™ Oscar Isaac), who is trying to live a normal life and keep his inner darkness at bay. Itâ€™s not easy, as he reveals his thoughts about harming himself: â€œI saw the desk and I just imagine leaning way back and slamming my forehead into the corner as hard as I could, over and over, into my eye,â€\\x9d he tells her. â€œBut that was an extreme. Itâ€™s not like that all the time.â€\\x9d Bergman is keen to take a holistic approach, which is not good news for Colin Belfast, her take-no-prisoners boss, played by David Schwimmer. He is heard rushing through the airport, tripping over a little girlâ€™s backpack as he instructs Bergman to â€œget really granular with all that shitâ€\\x9d. He even provides a moment of light relief. â€œThis is a walkway!â€\\x9d he rages, incredulously. â€œAll right. Goodbye. Good talk.â€\\x9d Homecoming is the first scripted series for Gimlet Media, producers of podcast hits such as Heavyweight, StartUp and Reply All. The quality of the acting draws you in, then stops you in your tracks. (Arrested Developmentâ€™s David Cross and comedian Amy Sedaris are also on the cast list.) It nails the feeling that characters are doing what theyâ€™re supposed to do, rather than standing huddled around a microphone. Subtle sound effects, such as a fishtank bubbling away in the background, and not-so-subtle ones like the noise of a busy airport, make it more akin to a lavish TV production than a staged radio drama. As the narrative flips back and forth from Heidiâ€™s time as a caseworker to five years later, when sheâ€™s waitressing, mystery surrounds what brought her there. Ending on a cliffhanger after only 19 minutes, Homecoming leaves you wanting more. Good job thereâ€™s another five episodes in the first season. If you like this, try this: Limetown, a mysterious tale of a place where everyone disappeared.',\n",
              "  'GDP growth confirmed in three months after Brexit vote British businesses continued to invest and consumers carried on spending in the months following the Brexit vote, defying predictions that a wave of uncertainty would hit economic activity. In the first official estimate of how firmsâ€™ spending fared after the referendum, the Office for National Statistics said business investment rose 0.9% in the July-to-September quarter. That was only a small slowdown from 1% growth in the previous quarter and beat forecasts for 0.6% growth in a Reuters poll of economists. The figures echoed business surveys suggesting companies have shrugged off the shock of the referendum result for now. The ONS confirmed its earlier estimate that GDP expanded 0.5% in the third quarter, only a small slowdown from 0.7% growth in the second quarter and stronger than most economists had predicted in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. But there were warnings the brunt of the Brexit vote would be felt next year as the weak pound stokes inflation and as negotiations over leaving the EU begin. Providing more details of the third quarter in Fridayâ€™s update, statisticians said consumer spending continued to be the main driver of economic growth, fuelled by rising household incomes. There was also a contribution to growth from net trade â€“ the difference between what the UK exports and imports. That came as imports fell but exports grew, probably helped by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit vote, which makes UK goods more competitive in overseas markets. But the data also confirmed earlier estimates showing that the construction sector had fallen into a technical recession, contracting for two straight quarters, while output was down for manufacturers and the wider industrial sector. The ONS said that since the referendum in June, GDP growth had been in line with recent trends, suggesting â€œlimited effect so farâ€\\x9d from the referendum. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS said: â€œInvestment by businesses held up well in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, though itâ€™s likely most of those investment decisions were taken before polling day. â€œThat, coupled with growing consumer spending fuelled by rising household income, and a strong performance in the dominant service industries, kept the economy expanding broadly in line with its historic average.â€\\x9d Economists were quick to warn the recent pace of growth would be hard to sustain. The governmentâ€™s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility, predict growth will slow to 1.4% in 2017 from 2.1% this year as business investment slows and as incomes are squeezed by higher living costs. Inflation is expected to pick up because the weaker pound makes imports to the UK more expensive. The data company IHS Markit said its surveys pointed to the firmsâ€™ and householdsâ€™ resilience continuing into the final quarter of this year. But it too was cautious about the year ahead. â€œFor the moment, the data suggest that the economy has exhibited greater than anticipated resilience in the face of headwinds such as Brexit worries and rising prices. However, it seems likely that growth will slow further in coming months as these headwinds intensify,â€\\x9d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics said importers and retailers would likely absorb some of the increase in costs from the weak pound, ensuring that the squeeze on household incomes is not too intense. Low interest rates would also help support consumers, she said. â€œWith ultra-accommodative monetary policy continuing to support spending and discourage saving, we donâ€™t think a sharp slowdown in spending is on the cards.â€\\x9d A leading thinktank warned this week that the combination of rising inflation and weaker pay growth as Brexit unfolds will mean UK workers face the longest squeeze on their pay for 70 years. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the recovery in real wages â€“ pay adjusted for inflation â€“ will now be so slow that by 2021 they will still not be back to their 2008 level before the global financial crisis hit. For now, however, the ONS figures showed consumers remained the biggest driving force behind GDP growth. Household spending rose 0.7% in the third quarter, down only slightly from 0.9% growth in the second quarter. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg said: â€œRather than postponing spending decisions amid the heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote, good fundamentals â€“ a strong labour market, rising house prices and improving credit conditions â€“ supported a continued expansion in household spending.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Pow! This isn't Batman v Superman. Whack! It's Wonder Woman v Supersexism What are we to make of the gender codes in Batman v Superman? Is it confused or certain, modern or prehistoric? To reach a clear conclusion, I might have to tell you the end, or at least flesh out my analysis that the lasso in the final battle is a metaphor for the omnipotent but non-lethal vagina. How do you like my spoiler huh? HUH? Everyone knows how to adjudicate the sexism in a normal film: do the women have agency, or are they perpetually needing rescue? Are the women naked more often than the men, for no clear reason? Does it pass the Bechdel test â€“ do two women have a conversation in a film about something other than a man? (This criterion is met so rarely now that itâ€™s pretty much the definition of arthouse.) In the more likely event that the women talk about nothing but men, is their dialogue at all sophisticated, or â€“ going by their words alone â€“ could they be any age from five? Upon these foundations, you can begin to adjudicate the film as you would a person, weigh it up for sleaziness, slut-shaming, the whole busy toolkit by which women are undermined; although then you get into the territory of â€œdoes the film think that, or just the character, and is misogyny actually conceived as a slur on that character in order that he might â€˜go on a journeyâ€™?â€\\x9d The distinction is incredibly easy to make in real life, but could happily take Twitter 20,000 years. The motifs of the superhero film complicate this slightly: nobody really talks about anything but good and evil; everybodyâ€™s clothes are so tight that they all may as well be naked. In a world where things are always catching fire for no reason, even your eyeballs, who can really say how much nudity is practical and how much titillating? Yet in the respects that Batman v Superman differs from the norm, it has quite a lot to say, albeit not all of it egalitarian or hugely consistent. Lois Lane is your classic spunky heroine, quick with the self-believing backchat, very slow in the matter of staying alive without constant assistance. Here she is in the desert, interviewing a terrorist, who unaccountably offered safe passage to a reporter from a seemingly local newspaper without knowing anything about her. â€œThey didnâ€™t tell me you were a lady,â€\\x9d says the terrorist, to which she shoots back, â€œIâ€™m not a lady, Iâ€™m a journalist.â€\\x9d Thereâ€™s a set of journalistic tropes which subvert the damsel in distress norm (broadly: critical thinking, tenacity and boldness). If we take survival as the main aim of any sensible person, these traits donâ€™t help, but theyâ€™re a start, right? On the matter of nudity, Lane has her main emotional journey while in the bath â€“ donâ€™t we all? Then Superman gets into the bath, fully clothed, to cheer her up, which is a new cinematic shorthand for â€œevolved man who sees you as an equalâ€\\x9d (cf Daniel Craig in Casino Royale â€“ the significance is that he is macho enough not to care about his clothes getting wet even if theyâ€™re leather, while feminine enough to see that a supportive gesture is required. Itâ€™s genius, really.) Lois isnâ€™t woeful, but breaks no moulds in terms of what she brings to the narrative; her sex appeal is built around peril, and her intimacy is in her helplessness. The headline act is Wonder Woman (weâ€™ll come to the maternal ideal later; it will be much later, and will only take a second, because it is pretty basic). Her only skill, for a long time, is in managing to steal something from Batman which he left in a perfectly visible place where any of us could have stolen it. â€œYou know itâ€™s true what they say about little boys,â€\\x9d she tells him, â€œborn with no natural inclination to share. I didnâ€™t steal it, I borrowed it.â€\\x9d Weirdly, people actually donâ€™t say that about little boys. Babies of both genders are shown to have a sense of fairness, from which sharing naturally proceeds, from the age of about six months. I baulk anyway at having to go through this phase of â€œwomen [superheroes] are innately betterâ€\\x9d before you get to a place where you acknowledge that essentialism has all been a giant delusion. Besides the stealing/borrowing, she has a show-stopping cleavage, unleashed to maximum effect in a series of asymmetrical clothes whose only internal logic is to make sure you can see her breasts but her neck is covered (otherwise it all goes a bit Bet Lynch). Furthermore, the stolen/borrowed files are no good to her, since she is foxed by the encryption, while Batman cracks into them with no problem at all, a plot element that has literally no purpose except to underscore that, even in the distant future, when you donâ€™t need shelves put up because you no longer read books, women will still need men for IT support. As we approach the final battle, her power is completely unknown, seeded by nothing except a photograph. From this standing start, she joins the fight with an urgent yet unhurried mien, in a spirit of cooperation rather than bashing the boysâ€™ heads together (which would have been patronising to a walk-outable degree). She retains an ability to process information: â€œ[this gigantic demon] seems to feed on energyâ€\\x9d. The military men on the ground figured this out already, probably with computers, but her behaviour nonetheless registers in stark contrast with that of Batman and Superman who, once engaged in battle, canâ€™t think about anything and can barely keep their pointy ears on straight. She does not launch the decisive attack. She is not the first among equals. Her weapon, at the climactic moment, is the lasso, just a holding device. It bothers me that if we do buy this as a metaphor for the female pudenda â€“ as I think we must â€“ then her gender becomes her status. There is no way for the female superhero to be anything but a wingman or helpmeet, in this framing. No monster died from not being able to use his arms. Yet Iâ€™ll take, in consolation, the change in her costume; the star-spangled pants have gone, the all-American colour-scheme has been muted into a kind of elemental Celtic mud. Compared to every Wonder Woman in history, she has a brute force; and set against Batman and Superman, she is the least kitsch, which may on some elemental level *MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT* account for her survival. One final note on the mothers: in the most preposterous plot twist, Batman and Superman, geared up for the whole film for an epic war in which personal animus mingles with a wider collision over their different interpretations of a superheroâ€™s quiddity, manage to come together because their mothers are both called Martha. A kind of Kray twins sentimentality mixed with a nerdâ€™s love of banal coincidence, this is about the least feminist updating of anything ever. Plainly, it will take more than Wonder Woman to smash the patriarchy, but sheâ€™s a start.\",\n",

              "  'The view on the automated future: fewer shops and fewer people Automation may put a third of a million retail employees out of work in the next eight years, according to the British Retail Consortium. Across the sector as a whole fewer people are now working, and are paid less, than in 2008. Competition, the move online and the welcome rise in the minimum wage are all accelerating the job losses. But it is the rise in technology that will go furthest. Robotics and artificial intelligence are moving to eliminate all kinds of work that had seemed reserved for humans, even those tasks that had appeared too personal or lowly paid to be vulnerable. Most of the automations of the 20th century eliminated unskilled male labour. Now it is the turn of unskilled women. The process is already under way. Salespeople are increasingly regimented and scripted in their interactions, a process that might be called artificial stupidity, while ever greater intelligence and ingenuity is demanded of the customer who tries to navigate an automated checkout. That â€œunexpected item in the bagging areaâ€\\x9d is your vestigial humanity. Retail banks provide a foretaste of this future: tellers have been replaced by machines, and the humans visible in the branches are there to sell products, not to help you. With a lot of shopping, there is no need for human salespeople. That is the principle on which self-service supermarkets were founded, and now it is being extended online. Thereâ€™s still a great deal of conscious effort to sell in supermarkets, as there is on Amazonâ€™s websites, but it is all done at one or two removes, by the designers of the layout and the programmers of the experience. Analogue, mammalian verbal persuasion has been abolished. The humans you speak to are far more likely to be apologising for the failure of computer systems than to be helping or encouraging you to buy things. Even online, where all of the effort is made by the shopper, the giant companies regard wages as they regard taxes, as a legacy problem to be eliminated in the frictionless and almost post-human future. Amazon workers presently walk anything up to 11 miles a day in the warehouses to stock their trolleys, but the company is hoping to produce robot pallets that will steer themselves to the workers who need them. Then, outside the warehouse, there is the hope of robot delivery vehicles, whether in the air, or on the ground. Even if wholly driverless cars and lorries may never be seen on the road, the human driver will increasingly become a supervisor rather than a hands-on controller. We already have cars that parallel park better than most people. Soon, automation will mean that one driver can direct half a dozen lorries down the motorway, and a cost saving like that will be hard for any haulage company to resist. Our own greed as customers is propelling this development. Itâ€™s already clear where it is going. Poorer communities will be left without shops at all, or with a poor choice of bad ones. Pleasant and prosperous enclaves will become more pleasant and more prosperous, with food, drink and even clothing produced in small, artisanal batches for anyone able and willing to pay a premium for human service and even human flattery. This process, too, is already well under way and can be expected only to accelerate. The rich get richer, and their lives get more enjoyable. Poor communities grow poorer and more hollowed out. Itâ€™s another example of the way that economic efficiency, narrowly measured, increases inequality. An optimist might say that this kind of change has been constant for the past 200 years. The jobs that automation has replaced have mostly been dirty, dangerous, or disagreeable. There have never been as many people employed in Britain as today, and certainly never as many women. Nonetheless, change has seldom been quicker and more vertiginous than today and weâ€™ll need human intelligence to reach a better future. We canâ€™t trust the computers to get us there on their own.',\n",
              "  'Getting down with the kids: children review musicâ€™s top tips for 2016 My first memory is of music. Iâ€™m two-and-a-half, standing on a stool in my grandmotherâ€™s kitchen; she has let me help her wash the dishes, which is quite the grown-up honour. I am spinning records in the sink â€“ essentially circling the water with a cleaning brush â€“ because the music on the radio has moved me so much. â€œTrou-per-per! Trou-per-per!â€\\x9d the song goes, brightly. I am shining like the sun, feeling like a number one. On that dull autumn afternoon, in a small Swansea scullery, began a little girlâ€™s 35-year (to date) love affair with ABBA, and a connection with Super Trouper that would grow through her life (Teens: wow, itâ€™s about touring! Twenties: itâ€™s about the essential melancholy of fame! Thirties: God, how did they all cope doing songs like this while they were divorcing?). Yes, that was me, but what do todayâ€™s kids think of pop? Are they more jaded and cynical because they have unlimited access to music? Or do their hearts still burst at the sound of a kick-drum, a synthesiser, a song? Iâ€™ve just written a book for young kids called Pop!, about the capacities this music can have, and the things it can do. I did it because I had a baby a few years ago, and felt my relationship to music go through a seismic shift. I wasnâ€™t having much fun: I was often sleep-deprived, and covered with Calpol or dribble, so Iâ€™d listen constantly to nostalgia radio stations, seeking out old favourite songs, and singing their lyrics directly, soppily, to my son. An old primary school disco favourite took on a new, rosy glow (thanks Yazz: â€œThe only way is up, baby, for you and me nowâ€\\x9d). A song Iâ€™d first loved on the soundtrack of Dirty Dancing now meant something quite different (bless the Ronettesâ€™ Be My Baby). I wanted to play these songs to my son (now 21 months) because they gave me comfort, of course, but I also wanted to enjoy his primal reactions to them. They took a while, but they came. His first proper, joyful wriggle? To something that I loved in my teens: Future Sound of Londonâ€™s Papua New Guinea (heâ€™s clearly a raver). One of his first standing-up dances? To the Archiesâ€™ bubblegum pop hit Sugar, Sugar (he loves something with a handclap). His first vocal response? To the Beatlesâ€™ She Loves You. â€œYeah, yeah, yeah, Mammy!â€\\x9d, he said, just the other week. â€œYeah, yeah, yeah!â€\\x9d It may sound pretentious, but one of the ideas behind my book was to give pop the credit it deserves as an art form that moves us. As I write in the book, people can use pop â€œto express their feelings about all the things happening in their livesâ€\\x9d. This also went for the way I was feeling. My listening habits in my sonâ€™s early months transported me to the easier days of my childhood, but also to pop stars who opened my mind, widened my eyes, pumped my heart â€“ larger-than-life creatures such as Adam Ant, Boy George, and, yes, David Bowie, who took me by the hand, and showed me a wider, bolder world. More than anything, I wanted to let children know that pop, at its best, is about self-expression, and that it â€œlets you be whomever you want to beâ€\\x9d. So what would children make of the crop of 2016â€™s most-likely-tos, the artists filling all those one-to-watch lists? On a Saturday morning at HQ, I get six- and seven-year-olds Bert, Juno, Xavier, Pearl and Jack to talk to me about pop and rate tracks by five rising stars (results on the panel over the page). Be warned: theyâ€™re a discerning bunch of critics. OK, theyâ€™re not great at spotting instruments or accents, and things can get a little chaotic (the idea that Jack Garratt was a carrot was a difficult concept to shake from them), but for stinging responses and irreverent comment, theyâ€™re your gang. Their tastes are often split on gender lines (dispiritingly common at this age, according to their parents), something also reflected in their favourite songs. The boys all love Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie (â€œBECAUSE ITâ€™S AWE-SUMMMMM!â€\\x9d, they explain, jumping off their chairs, screaming). The girls adore Katy Perryâ€™s Roar (Juno: â€œbecause itâ€™s bouncyâ€\\x9d ) and the Frozen soundtrackâ€™s Let It Go (Pearl: â€œmy mum said to me the other day, â€˜Can we turn this off now?â€™â€\\x9d). The girls take the reviewing task seriously, and whisper their ideas to each other. The boys try to impress each other, and affect suspicion of â€œquiet, pretty musicâ€\\x9d (although I spot their heads nodding when Iâ€™m not looking). Everyone also seems to like music their parents like, which wasnâ€™t always the way for my generation (I liked my mumâ€™s Beatles tapes, but thought David Essex was awful). This panelâ€™s parents had a much broader musical education, though, mainly because of their age. They grew up with acid house and Britpop, hip-hop and heavy metal, and most likely spent their teenage years reading music magazines that taught them, lengthily, about the past. Favourites of the panel today include BjÃ¶rk, the Bangles and Arctic Monkeys. Juno even comes along listening to a Spotify playlist, featuring Steve Miller Bandâ€™s The Joker and Cliff Richardâ€™s Devil Woman. But when the children are asked why they like things, theyâ€™re not always sure. I was like this at their age: I remember falling in love with Wham!â€™s Freedom when I was six, without understanding it, only knowing that the bit that went â€œyou know that Iâ€™ll forgive you/just this once, twice, foreverâ€\\x9d put butterflies in my tummy. Years later, I know how that song references Motown, how descending basslines push emotional buttons, and how hugely yearning those lyrics are. But most importantly: those butterflies are still there. While I fondly remember enjoying 60s cassettes in the car with my mum, the sharing of pop between the generations these days is a much bigger deal. My bum-wiggling toddler and I have attended countless classes led by long-suffering musicians with a keen eye on extra income (although watching a room full of babies shake rattles to La Bamba and We Will Rock You is quite fun for parents, admittedly). Iâ€™ve also DJed several times for Big Fish Little Fish, the national music and events crew who put on unpretentious â€œfamily ravesâ€\\x9d on Sunday afternoons (their brilliant slogan: â€œ2-4 hour party peopleâ€\\x9d). It is run by ex-senior civil servant, Hannah Saunders, who gave up a 20-year career to set it up, a career change which reminds us that weâ€™ve entered a new age for parenting: one in which mums and dads are allowed to have as much fun as their offspring. Pop is also about dancing, of course, and vivid, physical reactions. This is what I will remember most warmly from our perky pop panel: the arms flailing, the kids windmilling so unguardedly, so joyfully. But Iâ€™ll also remember their little reactions about melancholy, and the elaborate, silly stories they concocted, as small songs set off their imaginations in a million directions. By the end of our hour, Pearl and Juno had even decided to form a band and held their first meeting behind an executive chair (â€œGo away, Dad!â€\\x9d, Junoâ€™s father was told when he tried to take her home). Who knows? In 35 yearsâ€™ time, they may still have a special memory to relate, and a shared love of certain songs that have changed and grown with them. Either way, theyâ€™re super troupers, every one. Pop! by Jude Rogers and Alex Farebrother-Naylor is out now (Fisherton Press Â£6.99) Jack Garratt â€“ Worry (Island Records) Post Ed-Sheeran, eElectronica-drizzled, beardy singer-songwriter of the moment.

Xavier: [hears lyric] Maybe heâ€™s stealing from the bank? Jack: Maybe heâ€™s driving fast because he was late to steal from the bank, because he was sleeping in the pub, because he was so drunk.

A really peaceful rabbit. Juno: I think it sounded like a flower. Jack: A rabbit at night, jumping around quietly, trying to find its food without the foxes eating it. Xavier: It sounds like someone I met with a very weird voice. Or a violin singing. Pearl: Or a butterfly. It reminds me of Silent Night, like a song to help you go to sleep. It has a nice guitar, like a lullaby. I think she sounds pretty. Juno: I think sheâ€™s an old lady. [They are told her age] Xavier: Sheâ€™s a kid! A baby goat.

Juno: Itâ€™s a bit crazy. Xavier: [listens grudgingly] Itâ€™s an electric piano, I think. [copies sci-fi riff] Dun-dun-dun-dun-DUN! Jack: Iâ€™d like to listen to this if there was a future world war. Juno: Itâ€™s jazz. Itâ€™s very noisy and a bit bouncy. Pearl: I reckon the person who makes it is a bit ugly. Bert: And wears grey glasses. Juno: I think he sounds a bit stinky. Xavier: I think heâ€™s got a funny moustache.

I felt there was nothing inside me. Juno: I like the slow bit, middle bit, and the fast! Jack: I hated the start when it was quiet. The loud bit, I liked. Bert: Itâ€™s like a snail that goes really slow, then really fast and crashes into a car. Jack: Maybe itâ€™s a snail thatâ€™s had fast potion poured on it. Pearl: I like that it stopped for a second, then started again. Jack: Sheâ€™s angry because sheâ€™s shouty. Pearl: She thinks sheâ€™s like a boy, because sheâ€™s doing lots of shouting. But I like it. Bert: Maybe sheâ€™s a girl snail thatâ€™s so angry that she jumps into the middle of the Earth and explodes. Pearl: She sounds like sheâ€™s in a space rocket and she canâ€™t talk properly, then sheâ€™s shouting in space. Itâ€™s a bit of a joke, because she was only pretending she canâ€™t speak, so thatâ€™s why she shouts. Like this bit!

              "  'Brits are thin on the ground as May rolls out red carpet for Polish PM It could have been that Boris Johnson had managed to insult his opposite number. It could have been that Michael Fallon had been too keen to find out a little more about the Polish defence ministerâ€™s conviction that the hoax Protocols of the Elders of Zion pamphlet alleging a Jewish conspiracy for world domination may be real. Either way, when the two delegations trooped into the Downing Street press conference more than an hour later than planned, the Brits were thin on the ground. On the left side of the room was half the Polish government; on the right just David Davis, the Brexit minister. Lucky Poles. It wasnâ€™t hard to get the impression that the Brits werenâ€™t taking this UK-Polish summit quite as seriously as their counterparts. With most EU countries not really in the mood to talk to Britain until after article 50 has been triggered â€“ and even then only if they really must â€“ Theresa May has found herself short of countries willing to indulge her desire to shoot the breeze about foreign policy. So when Poland indicated it was willing to have a bilateral meeting, May was only too keen to roll out the red carpet. Schmoozing a rightwing, xenophobic government might not have been the best of looks when Britain was trying to reposition itself as open and friendly to Europe, but beggars canâ€™t be choosers. Besides, we did have some hate crime fences to mend. â€œWeâ€™ve had an excellent and historic first summit,â€\\x9d said Theresa at her most Maybotic, frantically racking her brains for anything memorable that had been discussed. After saying she was sorry for all the attacks on Poles in the UK since the EU referendum, the conversation had rather dried up. There had been a bit of chat about how much they both hated the Russians and sheâ€™d got away with making the 150 squaddies she had already promised to send to the Polish eastern border sound like a new commitment. But that was about it. â€œI did also update Prime Minister SzydÅ‚o on the work we are doing on Brexit,â€\\x9d she added as an afterthought. Best not to mention that had taken all of 30 seconds. The Polish PM, Beata SzydÅ‚o, had looked on impassively as the Maybot ran through her highlights package of the dayâ€™s events. She recalled it all rather differently. â€œGreat Britain doesnâ€™t have summits with countries like Poland very often,â€\\x9d she observed. And she was looking forward to many more in the coming months. Starting in Warsaw next year. The Maybot looked startled. Had she really agreed to that? The Polish interpreter whispered into her earpiece, assuring her that she had. â€œWeâ€™ve had useful bilateral talks about the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] in Poland and England,â€\\x9d SzydÅ‚o continued. â€œWe have also discussed having a chair of Polish studies at Cambridge University and making sure that Polish was taught in primary schools.â€\\x9d SzydÅ‚oâ€™s delivery is entirely deadpan, so it was hard to gauge if this was her idea of a joke or whether she was deadly serious. The Maybot may feel a bit guilty about the rise in hate crimes against Poles in England, but not enough to enrage the Eurosceptics in her party by teaching Polish to the Poles. This level of detail wasnâ€™t what the British government or the media had come to hear, and when the Maybot reluctantly took her two questions from the British media the attention switched back to Brexit. A Sunday Times interview had quoted the prime minister as saying she was losing sleep over Brexit. Was this true? â€œThere may have been an overinterpretation of my sleepless Brexit nights,â€\\x9d she said, anxious to make it look as if she wasnâ€™t in the slightest bit panicky. â€œThe Polish prime minister and I had some useful discussions about Brexit today. â€œNo we didnâ€™t,â€\\x9d said SzydÅ‚o. â€œYes we did,â€\\x9d said the Maybot, hastily rewriting history. â€œWe talked a lot about Brexit.â€\\x9d SzydÅ‚o had no memory of this. Much as she might have wanted some reassurances that Poles living in the UK would be allowed to stay after Brexit, she wasnâ€™t about to break ranks with the rest of the EU and sign up to a unilateral deal guaranteeing the rights of British people living in Poland. If May thought she could pick off the Poles as the weak link in the EU chain, she could think again. â€œAll we had today was bilateral talks,â€\\x9d SzydÅ‚o insisted. And she was looking forward to much more talk about SMEs in the near future. May groaned. If she hadnâ€™t been having sleepless nights before today, she would now.',\n",
              "  'Fire at Sea review â€“ from the migrant crisis, a gentle poetry Sometimes real life provides us with symbolic imagery that is every bit as potent and sophisticated as anything you would find in a fictional narrative. And one of the great strengths of Gianfranco Rosiâ€™s Berlin film festival prize-winning documentary is that the director is able to look at a dauntingly huge topic of global import â€“ the migrant crisis â€“ and find within it the little moments of poetic resonance that illuminate the human lives behind the stark statistics. The film takes place on, and around, the island of Lampedusa, 20 sq km of arid scrubland and arcane traditions. Since the early 00s, this isolated fishing community, located 127 miles from the southern coast of Sicily, has become one of the main entry points to Europe for refugees risking the treacherous sea crossing from north Africa. By focusing on Lampedusa, Rosi juxtaposes insular old Europe with a very 21st-century global reality. Migration is a topic that could hardly be more charged , but Rosi is no brow-beating polemicist. His approach is unobtrusive and observational rather than confrontational. The two worlds, that of the newly arrived refugees, adrift and traumatised, and the timeless locals, shaped by generations of devotion to the sea and the church, have surprisingly little interaction. However, Rosi seeks out threads between the two communities. The harrowing radio distress calls from sinking migrant vessels find an echo in the local radio station, where a young man plays songs from a bygone era and takes dedications from his most loyal listener, his aunt. A savagely beaten refugee gestures mutely to his facial injuries. On the rescue boat, he weeps tears mixed with blood. And in the most elegant of Rosiâ€™s parallels, a boy on Lampedusa called Samuele is diagnosed with a lazy eye. Like most of Europe, he sees, but doesnâ€™t see. This article was amended on 16 June 2016 to remove an incorrect reference to Lampedusa being the location for Luca Guadagninoâ€™s A Bigger Splash. It was filmed on Pantelleria, about 100 mile to the north.',\n",

              "  \"Donald Trump at the White House: Obama reports 'excellent conversation' â€“ as it happened Are you adjusted to the New Normal yet? President-elect Donald Trump was accorded a chilly but deferential welcome at the White House this morning as the president-elect met with President Barack Obama for a 90-minute private meeting in the Oval Office. In the first stage of a 72-day transition process between Tuesdayâ€™s unexpected election victory and Trumpâ€™s inauguration on 20 January, Obama said the two men discussed â€œforeign and domestic policyâ€\\x9d and how to ensure the handover of power went smoothly. â€œI want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,â€\\x9d Obama told his successor during a brief photo opportunity afterwards. Jihadis have welcomed Trumpâ€™s surprise victory in the American presidential race, saying his election would sow greater division and expose what they described as the hatred and racism of the west towards Muslims. The endorsement of the election result by extreme Islamist figures highlighted fears that Trumpâ€™s divisive rhetoric and call to ban Muslims from entering the US could empower radicals who have argued that the west seeks Islamâ€™s destruction and is at war with its adherents. Tens of thousands of Americans held further protests and acts of dissent against the election after a wave of demonstrations across the US on Wednesday night in which dozens were arrested. Protesters began mobilizing in major cities for a third day after crowds had descended on Trump buildings in New York, Chicago and Washington into the early hours to rail against the shock election result. There was a spate of claims of hate crimes in the US made on social media and to police today, in which the alleged victims said abusers had in some way cited Donald Trumpâ€™s victory in the US presidential election.Social media was rife with accounts of sometimes violent incidents of hate targeted at Muslims, Latinos and African Americans. Samantha Bee blamed white people for ruining America: And the Trump transition team put forward a few key team members: Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott told ABC Radio National that the US and UK elections and Brexit vote show that the non-politically correct donâ€™t want to tell pollsters what they really think because they would face â€œexcoriation.â€\\x9d President-elect Donald Trump has made his first swipe at the political media in his new role: President-elect Donald Trump reports that he had â€œgreat chemistryâ€\\x9d with president Barack Obama: Given that Trump spent much of the mid-aughts attempting to prove that Obama was not born in the United States and was therefore constitutionally ineligible to serve as president, this is surprising. Students at Cornell University held a â€œcry-inâ€\\x9d after the election of president-elect Donald Trump, according to the Ivy League schoolâ€™s student-run newspaper, where roughly 20 students met in the bleakness that is a November day in upstate New York to share tears, hugs and sorrows. â€œI am concerned how this is validating the behavior of a lot of people,â€\\x9d a student sipping a cup of coffee said in the Cornell Daily Sunâ€™s video, of the election. â€œIâ€™m quite terrified, honestly,â€\\x9d another student said. â€œItâ€™s saying that people are really given into fear-mongering - theyâ€™re willing to put people down based on their identity just so that they would feel vindicated that they would be getting rid of â€˜Crooked Hillary.â€™â€\\x9d â€œIâ€™d say the results are heartbreaking and such a slap in the face to so many of the populations that make up America,â€\\x9d a professor said. â€œI think itâ€™s also an indication that there and many many people who are suffering and feel that havenâ€™t been heard and they believe that Trump will answer their needs.â€\\x9d Donald Trumpâ€™s attorney told a federal judge on Thursday that heâ€™s open to settlement talks in a class-action fraud lawsuit involving the president-elect and his now-defunct Trump University. Attorney Daniel Petrocelli also asked during a hearing that the trial be delayed until early next year because Trump needs time to work on the transition to the presidency. The lawsuit alleging Trump University failed on its promise to teach success in real estate is currently set to begin 28 November in San Diego. Petrocelli said he agreed to an offer by US district court Judge Gonzalo Curiel to have US district Judge Jeffrey Miller work with both sides on a possible settlement. â€œI can tell you right now Iâ€™m all ears,â€\\x9d Petrocelli told Curiel. Petrocelli said he planned to file a formal request for a delay by Monday. Curiel didnâ€™t say how he would rule but encouraged efforts to settle. Petrocelli said it didnâ€™t appear possible for Trump to attend the trial, and Curiel said he didnâ€™t expect attendance by the president-elect. â€œWeâ€™re in uncharted territory. We need a little bit of time,â€\\x9d Petrocelli said. Earlier in the day Curiel, the Indiana-born jurist who was accused of bias by Trump over his Mexican heritage, tentatively denied a request to ban statements made by and about Trump during his campaign from being used at the trial. The highly unusual petition would apply to Trumpâ€™s tweets, a video of Trump making sexually predatory comments about women, his tax history, revelations about his private charitable foundation and the public criticism of the judge. Arizona senator Jeff Flake, speaking with MSNBCâ€™s Chuck Todd about the impending Trump administration, told the Meet the Press host that although he opposed Trump during the campaign, â€œthere are a lot of things that we agree onâ€\\x9d and that Trump has, so far, been â€œgraciousâ€\\x9d to his vanquished and/or conquered opponents. â€œI think all of us who have opposed him during the process of [have eaten] a huge helping of crow already,â€\\x9d said the Republican senator. â€œI didnâ€™t think that he would get this far, I really didnâ€™t.â€\\x9d â€œWhen there are areas of disagreement and there may be some, there will be some, weâ€™ll push back,â€\\x9d Flake continued. â€œBut in the meantime, there are a lot of things that we agree on. I think heâ€™s been gracious so far in terms of outreach and has done it right so far. And weâ€™ll see where we go.â€\\x9d President-elect Donald Trump has officially won the traditionally red state of Arizona, two days after election night. Heavy Latino turnout in the Grand Canyon State, as well as young people encouraged by a ballot initiative that would have regulated marijuana like alcohol, contributed to a massive groundswell of Democratic support, but apparently not enough for defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to win the state. Former president Bill Clinton has made a quick phone call to president-elect Donald Trump, wishing the newly minted 45th president of the United States and his wifeâ€™s former political rival well. â€œDuring the brief call, President Clinton congratulated Mr. Trump and wished him well,â€\\x9d an aide to Clinton told ABCâ€™s Liz Kreutz. Trump had long used Clintonâ€™s personal peccadilloes as ammunition against the former secretary of state. Bygones, right? Because itâ€™s 2016 and thus forbidden for a day to go past without an open letter appearing somewhere, hereâ€™s another one. This time itâ€™s written by a fictional character, if that helps any: Leslie Knope, the relentlessly positive public servant from Park and Recreation, played by Amy Poehler. Upbeat, yes. Positive: not so much. I do not accept it. I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the president. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story. Several hundred protesters are taking to the streets for the second night running to protest against Trumpâ€™s victory, though not yet on the scale of the thousands seen on Wednesday evening. In several places, high school and college students staged walk-out protests. At Baylor University in Texas, several dozen students have gathered: In Denver, Colorado, protesters are beginning to gather for a march scheduled to begin soon: Hundreds more gathered outside the Ohio statehouse in Columbus: And in Louisville, Kentucky: Around a thousand people have taken to the streets of Minneapolis, NBC is reporting, while students at the University of Minnesota also gathered for a protest: In Philadelphia, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in Center City for a candlelit vigil, according to the Philadelphia Enquirer. News that British prime minister Theresa May has finally had her phone call with Trump has certainly gladdened the hearts of some sections of the UK press: Peter Walker reports from London: In the call, Trump made reference to the famously close relationship between Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher as a hopeful aim for their ties, a Downing Street source said. Trump â€œalluded to their relationship as a way to underline that he was keen to have a good personal working relationship, too,â€\\x9d the source said. A Downing Street statement added that the prime minister called â€œto congratulate him on his hard-fought election campaign and victoryâ€\\x9d, and confirmed May had been invited to visit the US â€œas soon as possibleâ€\\x9d. â€œShe noted President-elect Trumpâ€™s commitment in his acceptance speech to uniting people across America, which she said is a task we all need to focus on globally,â€\\x9d read one section of the statement, which is as close as May has come so far to referring to Trumpâ€™s controversial and divisive campaign. The call came after concerns that the much-vaunted special relationship with the US might have suffered an early setback under Trump as he spoke to nine other world leaders in the 24 hours after his election win, without May getting a call. Thanks to the magic synchronicity of Twitter, we can confirm that the vice-president-elect has spoken to the British foreign secretary, and that the â€œspecial relationshipâ€\\x9d remains â€¦ special: Edward Snowden has said he is unafraid of Russian president Vladimir Putin turning him over to the US as a favor to President-elect Donald Trump. The national security whistleblower, speaking during a webchat from Russia this afternoon, where he has been stranded since disclosing revelations of widespread National Security Agency surveillance in 2013, said it would be â€œcrazy to dismissâ€\\x9d the prospect of Trump striking a deal with Putin that leads to his extradition and trial. But he added: â€œIf I was worried about safety, if the security and the future of myself was all that I cared about, I would still be in Hawaii.â€\\x9d Snowden told the webchat hosted by the Dutch privacy-focused search engine StartPage he was comfortable with and proud of the choices he had made. â€œI think I did the right thing,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWhile I canâ€™t predict what the future looks like, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen tomorrow, I can be comfortable with the way Iâ€™ve lived to today.â€\\x9d Trump, who has been complimentary about Putin and Russia in a manner that prompted accusations from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that he was a â€œpuppetâ€\\x9d, has in the past mused about having Snowden killed. Trumpâ€™s major national security ally, the retired general and former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael Flynn, oversaw a highly speculative DIA report that claimed Snowden took from the NSA a larger trove of documents than ever confirmed based on what Snowden could access as a contract systems administrator. â€œSnowden is a spy who has caused great damage in the US. A spy in the old days, when our country was respected and strong, would be executed,â€\\x9d Trump tweeted in 2014. All of that has prompted concern among Snowdenâ€™s supporters worldwide that the groundwork for an extradition is in place. But Snowden proclaimed himself unperturbed. The first sighting of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton after her concession to president-elect Donald Trump yesterday afternoon: Dan Roberts takes a look a policies that could be implemented under President-elect Donald Trump. Another White House transition-team pool report: Hope Hicks has not responded to any additional emails with questions about the president-electâ€™s status, schedule or whereabouts since changing course and saying he was headed back to New York. If there is any other information that comes in, I will send it immediately, but otherwise I wonâ€™t have any further pool reports today. Thanks to you all for bearing with my failed attempts to get more out of the transition today. Little on-the-nose, donâ€™t you think? Former Vermont governor and onetime presidential candidate Howard Dean has announced via Twitter that he is running to reclaim his old position as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Dean, who served as chair from 2005 to 2009, is running to replace interim chair Donna Brazile, who has served since July when Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz resigned in the wake of a Russian-sponsored hack of DNC servers that revealed high-level antipathy towards then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders among the DNCâ€™s leadership. Video: President-elect Donald Trump appeared before the press to answer several questions this afternoon during a visit to Capitol Hill, and said that his first priorities once he is inaugurated will be controlling immigration, reforming healthcare and creating â€œbig league jobs.â€\\x9d (Or, possibly, â€œbigly jobs.â€\\x9d Weâ€™ve never been totally sure!) Trump was in Washington to meet President Obama and also held discussions with key Republican figures including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. The president-electâ€™s staff has provided no information, despite being asked, about his schedule or activities since leaving Capitol Hill. This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime. Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard ... he connected in ways with people no one else did. President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team has announced that former Ohio secretary of state Ken Blackwell will be in charge of handling domestic policy issues in relation to the upcoming Trump administrationâ€™s legislative and executive priorities in its first hundred days Blackwell, who currently works as a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, a Christian lobbying organization that lobbies lawmakers against LGBT rights, abortion and pornography, first gained national attention in 2006, when he was running to serve as Ohioâ€™s governor. In an interview at the time, Blackwell declared that homosexuality was a â€œlifestyleâ€\\x9d that â€œcan be changed. â€œI think homosexuality is a lifestyle, itâ€™s a choice, and that lifestyle can be changed,â€\\x9d Blackwell told the Columbus Dispatch at the time. â€œI think it is a transgression against Godâ€™s law, Godâ€™s will.â€\\x9d â€œThe reality is, again,â€\\x9d Blackwell continued, â€œthat I think we make choices all the time. And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle. Our expectation is that oneâ€™s genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac. Do I think that they can be changed? Yes.â€\\x9d Trump himself has said that, while he does not support same-sex marriage rights, he does support LGBT rights. Vice president-elect Mike Pence, on the other hand, first emerged on the national stage after signing an expansive anti-LGBT measure into law, and once signed into law a bill that would send same-sex couples attempting to obtain marriage licenses to jail. From the president-electâ€™s pool report: Hope Hicks sends the following update about the president-electâ€™s plans for tonight: â€˜Now heading to NYCâ€™ That is the full extent of what she has told me. She is not responding to questions about his schedule for the rest of the day The â€œdishonest pressâ€\\x9d is getting its comeuppance from the new administration, it seems. President Barack Obama should urgently seek to impose constitutional checks on the US presidentâ€™s access to â€œthe most awesome assassination machine ever known to manâ€\\x9d, a former state department official in the Obama administration said today. Jeremy Shapiro disclosed the Obama team before the 2012 elections had considered imposing such constitutional checks on the US presidentâ€™s ability to order killings fearing Obama was about to lose the presidential elections to the Republicans. Speaking in London, Shapiro, a former special adviser an assistant secretary in the State Department, disclosed the Obama team in the State Department â€œin the run-up to the 2012 election the Obama thought might lose and there was some thinking - â€˜Gee, we have created the most awesome assassination machine ever known to man whereby we can, with very little oversight, basically kill anyone in the world outside of America.â€™â€\\x9d He added the Obama officials thought â€œWe are using that responsibly because we are good people,â€\\x9d but it was not institutionalized. â€œWhen people looked at it they thought, â€˜Christ this is scary, what if we give this to the Republicans?â€™â€\\x9d He said the Obama team â€œstarted to have a process to institutionalize the process, but it did not get very institutionalized.â€\\x9d Leslie Vinjamuri, senior lecturer at SOAS, added Obama should put all his remaining energy in his final weeks in the Oval Office to â€œdo anything he can to to regulate, to create norms, institutionalize, create blocking mechanisms.â€\\x9d The academics were discussing Trumpâ€™s approach to foreign policy and the degree he will delegate or take personal charge. Shapiro warned: â€œin the last 15 years, power in foreign policy has centralized to an enormous extent within the presidency and Congress, and most of the institutions in foreign policy has become enormously supine in the face of what ever the [resident wants to do does in foreign policy. We have essentially by default almost given this to the president.â€\\x9d Cora Currier writes for the : Audre Lorde once wrote that â€œpoetry is not a luxuryâ€\\x9d, and right now it is a necessity. What kind of poetry can get us through a Donald Trump presidency? Weâ€™ll need satire and spitting vitriol. Weâ€™ll need rallying cries. Weâ€™ll need reminders of human dignity. Each poet here has struggled with the relationship between poetry and action, with the question of poetryâ€™s relevance in a time of crisis. Adrienne Rich said: â€œA poem canâ€™t free us from the struggle for existence, but it can uncover desires and appetites buried under the accumulating emergencies of life.â€\\x9d These are words carefully chosen not for solace but for strength, poems that dip into the reservoirs of literature to find fuel for the day ahead. They are, to borrow from WH Audenâ€™s famous poem September 1, 1939, â€œironic points of lightâ€\\x9d that â€œflash out wherever the Just / exchange their messagesâ€\\x9d. Poems that serve as signals through the ages that good exists, and that someone is awake and listening. Click through for: Gwendolyn Brooks â€“ Langston Hughes Adrienne Rich â€“ What Kind of Times Are These Nayyirah Waheed â€“ Some words build houses in your throat Margaret Atwood â€“ Men with the Heads of Eagles Muriel Rukeyser â€“ Poem A US judge on Thursday tentatively rejected a bid by Donald Trump to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign out of an upcoming fraud trial over his Trump University venture, Reuters reports: The ruling came in advance of a pretrial hearing later on Thursday where lawyers for the president-elect will square off against students who claim they were they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trumpâ€™s real estate investing â€œsecretsâ€\\x9d from his â€œhand-pickedâ€\\x9d instructors. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the studentsâ€™ court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business. Trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 28. In the ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego said Trumpâ€™s lawyers can renew objections to specific campaign statements and evidence during trial. Trumpâ€™s attorneys had argued that jurors should not hear about statements Trump made during the campaign, including about Curiel himself. Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trumpâ€™s pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Read the full piece here. Hereâ€™s footage of the impromptu press conference, via the Huffington Post: Asked about his priorities, Trump mentions immigration, the border, health care and jobs, â€œbig league jobs.â€\\x9d Ohio governor John Kasich is praying for the success of Trump, whom he has come very close to openly despising. Trump has emerged from the meeting and started an impromptu gaggle with reporters that ended when he was asked about his plan to ban Muslims, CNN reports: Trump is still meeting with McConnell, the press pool reports: The President-elect is still in his meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, which an aide said should last up to an hour. The two walked by earlier, but have remained inside since. The Vice President-elect has already left the Capitol. Hereâ€™s a transcription via the Trump press pool of Trumpâ€™s meeting with speaker Paul Ryan: Ryan repeatedly chided reporters for shouting questions --- including how the â€œwall is going to be paid for.â€\\x9d Ryan: Donald Trump had one of the most impressive victories we have ever seen and weâ€™re going to turn that victory into progress for the American people, and we are now talking about how we are going to hit the ground running to get this country turned around and make America great again.â€\\x9d Trump: Speaker Ryan, thank you very much. We had a meeting, I met with president before, as you know. I think we are going to absolutely spectacular things for the American people and I look forward to starting --- quite frankly we canâ€™t get started fast enough.â€\\x9d [Inaudible] â€œâ€¦ Whether itâ€™s on healthcare or immigration so many different things. Weâ€™re going to lower taxes, so many different things we are going to be working on.â€\\x9d â€œWe had a very detailed meeting, and weâ€™re going to lower taxes, as you know, health care weâ€™re going to make it affordable. We are going to do a real job on healthcare [inaudible]. As he wrapped up, Trump said he had a â€œgreat meetingâ€\\x9d with Ryan and then the Speaker led him out onto his balcony. The Obamasâ€™ dogs got one whiff of Trump and ambled elsewhere. Trump will stay in DC for the night, spokeswoman Hope Hicks has informed the media pool. But no word on whether heâ€™ll stay at his new hotel on Pennsylvania avenue. Endorse. From the piece: And she [the heavy-construction worker] shared an anecdote that reflected how differently Trumpâ€™s comments had been received in some places than others. â€œIâ€™m setting steel for this new gas plantâ€¦Iâ€™m operating a rough terrain forklift,â€\\x9d she wrote. â€œSo today, I kept thinking about the debate and the audio was released â€¦ And I got underneath a load of steel and was moving itâ€¦I was laughing and laughing and one of the iron workers asked â€˜what are u laughing at.â€™ I said â€˜I grabbed that load right by the pussyâ€™ and laughed some moreâ€¦And said â€˜when youâ€™re an operator you can do that ya knowâ€™, laughed all fucking day.â€\\x9d Just last week, I was back in Ohio, in the southeastern Appalachian corner. I was at a graduation ceremony for opiate addicts who had gone through a recovery program, and sitting with four women, all around 30, who were still in the program. Someone mentioned the election, and all four of them piped up that they were voting for the first time ever. For whom? I asked. They looked at me as if I had asked the dumbest question in the world. All four were for Trump. The most of the loquacious of the group, Tiffany Chesser, said she was voting for him because her boyfriend worked at a General Electric light-bulb plant nearby that was seeing more of its production lines being moved to Mexico. She saw voting for Trump as a straightforward transaction to save his job. â€œIf he loses that job weâ€™re screwed â€” Iâ€™ll lose my house,â€\\x9d she said. â€œThere used to be a full parking lot there â€” now you go by, there are just three trucks in the lot.â€\\x9d Look who else is visiting the White House today! John Kasich, the Ohio governor who never gave Trump the time of day and voted for John McCain for president and whose state was then won by Trump by almost 9 points. Thatâ€™s Kasich there at left. Oh yes and also thatâ€™s the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James, who campaigned a lot for Clinton, is in the White House today. What he said. Obamacare enrollments (or preliminary signups? itâ€™s not clear) spiked after the election, the secretary of health and human services reports: Now Trump and Pence and Melania Trump are meeting with senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on Capitol Hill. McConnell said yesterday he expected to work with Trump on filling the supreme court vacancy, on tax reform, on Obamacare and more. Developing... Thereâ€™s the Martin Luther King Jr bust Barack Obama moved into the Oval Office upon becoming president. Obama was criticized for moving a bust of Winston Churchill outside the Oval to make room for MLK. There are â€œonly so many tables where you can put busts, otherwise it starts looking a little cluttered,â€\\x9d Obama said. Anyone think the MLK Jr bust will stay there after January? Paul Ryan can see Donald Trumpâ€™s hotel from his house the Capitol balcony. Thatâ€™s vice-president-elect Mike Pence and Melania Trump with them of course. Some initial footage, and the requisite â€œthis meeting was wonderfulâ€\\x9d quote from Ryan. Developing... Josh Earnest describes the Michelle Obama - Melania Trump meeting. They had tea, admired a balcony view and talked about raising kids in the White House. How different than what would have come to pass had Clinton won. Earnest: The first lady hosted Mrs Trump in the private residence... for some tea and a tour... part of that tour included stepping out onto the Truman balcony... youâ€™ve heard the president and Mrs Obama describe the quality of time that theyâ€™ve spent on the Truman balcony.... there was also an opportunity for the two women to walk through the state floor of the White House... They also had a discussion about raising kids at the White House. The first ladyâ€™s two daughters spent their formative years here at the White House... After their tour concluded, the first lady and Mrs Trump walked over to the Oval Office and the two couples had a chance to speak. Obama on Monday called Trump â€œtemperamentally unfitâ€\\x9d and â€œuniquely unqualified.â€\\x9d â€œThe presidentâ€™s views havenâ€™t changed,â€\\x9d the press secretary says. But itâ€™s time for a successful transition. â€œThe presidentâ€™s plan to take a long vacation after he leaves office have not changed.â€\\x9d â€“ Josh Earnest Obama appreciated how George W Bush gave him space after Obama took office, giving him â€œsome running room,â€\\x9d Earnest says. â€œPresident Obama admired that.â€\\x9d He doesnâ€™t sound like heâ€™s kidding: After dismissing the question multiple times, Earnest allows that yes, Obama may continue to think that Trump is unqualified to be president: Further to our earlier post about hate incidents since the election, the sâ€™ Luis Echegaray flags a disturbing incident at Elon University in North Carolina: Hereâ€™s a further collection of such incidents: Earnest is asked about the anti-Trump protests across the country on Wednesday evening. Reply: Weâ€™ve got a carefully, constitutionally protected right to free speech... it is a right that should be exercised without violence. There are people disappointed in the outcome... but itâ€™s important for us to remember that weâ€™re Democrats and Republicans but weâ€™re Americans and patriots first. Read further: Earnest is asked whether Obama still considers Trump unfit to be president. Reply: The two men did not re-litigate their differences in the Oval Office. Weâ€™re on to the next phase now. Via the house speakerâ€™s spokesperson: The President-elect, Mrs. Trump, Vice President-elect, and the Speaker are having lunch and discussing the transition. The Speaker has also invited President-elect Trump to the Capitol after their meeting to show him where heâ€™ll be sworn in on Inauguration Day. Press secretary Josh Earnest is talking about the big meeting. He says he met Jared Kushner and Hope Hicks. â€œI had the opportunity to meet with her briefly â€“ to meet her, I should say.â€\\x9d On the Obama-Trump meeting, Earnest has this to say: The meeting might have been a little less awkward than some might have expected. Trump referred in the Oval to some â€œhigh-flying assetsâ€\\x9d the president had told him about, a reporter notes. What the heck was that about? Earnest refers the question to team Trump. Hereâ€™s some added color from inside the Oval office, via the Trump media pool, which Trump ditched again upon leaving the White House for his meeting with Paul Ryan: The president kept saying, â€œtell me when youâ€™re readyâ€\\x9d to reporters, as he waited to make a statement. The president-elect looked around the room, and at the floor, his hands tented below him. The only senior aide in the room spotted in the room from the White House was press secretary Josh Earnest. Trump aides Hope Hicks and Jared Kushner, who had been waiting in the Cabinet room until the meeting concluded, were in place as well. Kushner took iPhone photos as they spoke. Obama looked straight at Trump for the full statement, his hands clasped. He nodded at the end. Both men ignored shouted questions, including â€œMr. President, do you still think he is a threat to the republic?â€\\x9d Obama explained to Trump with a joke that the reporters always ask questions and they need to be shooed out, as he motioned with his hand. He singled out one aide who was wrangling the press, saying, â€œsheâ€™s small, but sheâ€™s tough.â€\\x9d Trump said â€œsheâ€™s doing a very good job.â€\\x9d Barack Obama: I just had the opportunity to have an excellent conversation with President-elect Trump. It was wide-ranging. We talked about some of the organizational issues in setting up the White House. We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy. And as I said last night, my number one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president elect is successful. And I have been very encouraged by the I think interest in president elect Trumpâ€™s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces and I believe that it is important for all of us regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face. And in the meantime Michelle has had a chance to greet the incoming first lady and we had an excellent conversation with her as well. And we want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition. And most of all I want to emphasize to you, Mr President Elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed then the country succeeds. Please [indicates Trump should speak]. Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much President Obama. This was a meeting that was going to last for maybe 10 or 15 minutes and we were just going to get to know each other. We had never met each other. I have great respect- the meeting lasted for almost an hour and a half, and it could have, as far as Iâ€™m concerned, it could have gone on for a lot longer. We really, we discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. Heâ€™s explained some of the difficulties, some of the high flying assets and some of the really great things that have been achieved. So Mr President, it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future. Obama: Thank you everybody â€“ we are not going to be taking any questions. [To Trump:] Always a good rule: donâ€™t answer any questions when they just start yelling. Hereâ€™s a video of Obama and Trumpâ€™s full remarks following their Oval Office meeting: Remember Aaron Schock, the former Illinois congressman whose sketchy use of his congressional allowance and campaign funds was exposed after a reporter spoke with the interior decorator of his office who said sheâ€™d been inspired by Downton Abbey? Heâ€™s been indicted. Now to hatch plans with his Republican colleagues for next steps. Trump is in a motorcade en route to meet with House speaker Paul Ryan at the Capitol Hill Club and majority leader Mitch McConnell at Capitol Hill. Hereâ€™s a media pool transcription of president Obamaâ€™s remarks: We talked about some of organizational issues in setting up the White House. We talked about foreign policy. We talked about domestic policy. As I sat last night, my number one in the next coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful and I have been very encouraged by the interest by the President-elect Trumpâ€™s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces. I believe that it is important for all regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together to deal with the many challenges we face. More video and photos of the meeting: An amicable â€“ if a bit stiff, and did we notice strained on the presidentâ€™s part? â€“ appearance before the cameras for the two men. Obama says â€œI have been very encouraged by an interest in president-elect Trumpâ€™s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that the country faces... it is important for all of us ... to now come together, work together... Michelleâ€™s had the chance to greet the incoming first lady, and weâ€™ve had an excellent conversation and want to make sure they feel welcome... We now are gonna want to do everything we can because if you succeed the country succeeds. Trump: We had never met.. The meeting was supposed to last 10 minutes... I have great respect... it went on for an hour-and-a-half and as far as Iâ€™m concerned it could have gone on longer... we really we discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. Mr president, was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many many more times in the future. According to reports and photos shown to me by a friend in the room, a grinning Trump patted Obama on the back as they got up to leave, though there was only one handshake between the two men in front of the brief photo opportunity. You donâ€™t see that expression on Obamaâ€™s face often. Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. â€œIf he succeeds, the country succeeds,â€\\x9d Obama said. Trump said he had â€œrespect for the presidentâ€\\x9d and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a â€œvery fine man.â€\\x9d Trump also boasted of how long their meeting had been. He said it was scheduled for ten minutes but lasted for an hour and a half, and could have gone on much longer. Obama and Trump talked about foreign and domestic policy according to initial pool chatter in the press room. More to come.... In short remarks, the president said the two had an â€œexcellent conversation.â€\\x9d The Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House, the Wall Street Journal reports. But weâ€™re about to get photos from inside the Oval office. The media pool is going into the Oval Office now. That suggests a 90-minute meeting. POTUS and PEOTUS were seated in the high-backed armchairs at the end of the room, as is typical for when the President speaks to world leaders. Both men spoke briefly. Remarks to come... At least weâ€™ll have access to the vice president? Thatâ€™s pretty important, right? Still meeting. President Barack Obama and president-elect Donald Trump have been meeting for about 90 minutes now. What are they talking about do you think? Is Obama lecturing Trump about keeping a cool head? Is Trump lecturing Obama about leadership? Are they comparing notes on what it feels like to give electrifying speeches to thousands of people across the country? Is Obama telling Trump about how much his hate speech wounds individual Americans and the country and world at large? Is he lecturing Trump on the constitution? Is Trump asking to â€œtry out that chairâ€\\x9d? Are they talking about family, about Vladimir Putin, about government surveillance, about filling the role of mourner-in-chief after mass shootings, about protocol, about climate change? Trumpâ€™s traveling press pool continues to track Kushner and McDonough. Kushner, the scion of a New Jersey real estate empire that dwarfs Trumpâ€™s, was a key adviser to his father-in-law throughout the campaign. Itâ€™s unclear what role he would have in the White House. The pool report: McDonough and Kushner walked back from the lawn and across the Rose Garden at 12:07. McDonough led him up the colonnade, followed by the same group of aides whoâ€™d left them on their own for the walk. They entered the White House, looked up briefly when a reporter called out â€œDenis!â€\\x9d but did not respond. Trump and Obama are still meeting. What are they talking about? Obamacare? Hereâ€™s a photo of Jared Kushner and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough: Following his meeting with Obama today, president-elect Trump will meet with House speaker Paul Ryan at the Capitol Hill Club and majority leader Mitch McConnell at Capitol Hill. Trump has been hard on Ryan, attacking him repeatedly during the campaign as a weak leader. Ryan canceled a plan campaign appearance with Trump after the emergence of hot-mic video in which Trump described grabbing womenâ€™s genitals without their consent. Members of Trumpâ€™s staff including campaign chairman Stephen Bannon have called for Ryanâ€™s head and itâ€™s possible the president-elect will seek to torpedo Ryanâ€™s reelection as House speaker. But on Wednesday, Ryan put a good face on the relationship, saying he had spoken with Trump twice and was eager to work with him and calling Trumpâ€™s election good for the country. McConnell voiced a similar view. Three Republican men in control of the legislative and executive branches. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has been offered a White House job, she tweets. Conway is the first woman ever to have run a successful presidential campaign. (Donna Brazile was Al Goreâ€™s campaign manager in 2000; he lost?) What are they doing in there? Dan Roberts reports from the White House: The press pool still has not gone into the Oval Office, which suggests the meeting is going on longer than some of us expected. From the media pool assigned to Trump which Trump has ditched, a sighting of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough was just spotted leading Jared Kushner and other Trump aides, including Dan Scavino, across the back edge of the Rose Garden. McDonough led Kushner on a walk down the South Lawn as the others dispersed. Reminds us of the time in 2006 that Kushner and Peter Kaplan went to that Yankees game. Seemed high-stakes at the time; Kushner had just purchased the New York , where Kaplan was editor, which nobody wanted to see fail. Kaplan died of cancer in 2013. Kushnerâ€™s now getting the keys to the White House. Hereâ€™s an interesting phenomenon. Trump supporters coming out of the woodwork post-election. Maybe the sign instead of being an expression of support for Trump in particular is a general expression of patriotic hope for a steady future for the country? Hm. But wouldnâ€™t an American flag work better in that case? (h/t @loisbeckett) The press pool is going in now, in the first sign that the Obama-Trump meeting is coming close to an end. The pool includes members of the separate press pool which has been covering Trump but has been barred for being with him since the election. The press pool has just been informed that in 10 minutes they will be going back to prepare for a â€œsprayâ€\\x9d. What will happen is they will stand in a West Wing corridor, for what I guess will be 15-20 minutes, while they wait for the private Obama-Trump meeting to finish. Then they will be ushered inside the Oval Office to take pictures of Trump and Obama and record what we expect to be brief remarks from each. It is possible, though unlikely, that Trump may come out to another â€œstake-outâ€\\x9d location outside the front of the West Wing afterwards to make separate remarks to the wider press corps. More likely he will depart, as he arrived, out of public sight. A spokesperson for British prime minister Theresa May releases this description of a conversation between May and Trump: The Prime Minister spoke to US President-elect Donald Trump earlier today to congratulate him on his hard-fought election campaign and victory. The President-elect said he very much looked forward to working with the Prime Minister and congratulated her on her recent appointment. The Prime Minister and President-elect Trump agreed that the US-UK relationship was very important and very special, and that building on this would be a priority for them both. President-elect Trump set out his close and personal connections with, and warmth for, the UK. He said he was confident that the special relationship would go from strength to strength. Trumpâ€™s staff has not released a description of the call. Thatâ€™s unusual. Presidents typically release their own versions of such communications so they can frame the conversation their way instead of conceding to the foreign governmentâ€™s framing. Trumpâ€™s staff is not informing the media of top-level â€“ official now, arenâ€™t they? â€“ conversations Trump is having with foreign leaders, among who knows what other conversations. Heâ€™s here, reports Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts from the White House: Police are investigating the burning of a gay pride flag outside a home in Rochester, NY, as a potential hate crime, TWC news reports: Ventura said he connects this incident and another flag burning in the same neighborhood to the election. To help deal with what had happened, he joined dozens of others Wednesday night at the Gay Alliance LGBTQ Resource Center, where many were also feeling distressed about the election outcome. Reports of racist attacks and other hate-crime behavior have surfaced again and again since the election. Hereâ€™s one against Muslim-Americans in San Diego Wednesday and here is one against a Mexican restaurant in Boston. As Trump meets Obama, Michelle Obama is to take Melania Trump on a tour of the White House and the east wing where the family lives. This afternoon, vice president Joe Biden is to meet with vice-president-elect Mike Pence, a longtime legislator relatively well-known in Washington. There is not expected to be any live coverage of the Trump Obama meeting, but here is a live stream that may capture Trumpâ€™s arrival: Trump ditched his press pool this morning, in continuance of his late-campaign practice. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks told Trumpâ€™s pool that the White House would provide pool coverage of todayâ€™s meeting. The White House press pool of course is at the White House, not with Trump. So that doesnâ€™t make any sense. The protective press pool attached to the president, when it works, increases the access of the public to the presidency and the White House. The press pool describes the daily movements of the president and remarks variations in those, introduces the public to the people and conversations in the presidentâ€™s orbit, and provides coverage in case of unforeseen events extending to an emergency. Insofar as the media is a tool for the public to pry open and look inside the government â€“ and we are keenly aware that a lot of people these days think â€œinsofarâ€\\x9d is â€œnot very farâ€\\x9d â€“ the press pool is a tool for the larger media to keep an eye on the president. Trumpâ€™s ditching it, for now. Take him to our leader. The Canadian government has said it is open to renegotiating Nafta â€“ the North American free-trade agreement, routinely described by Donald Trump on the campaign trail as the â€œworst deal in historyâ€\\x9d â€“ in a move that extends an olive branch to the incoming US administration. [Trump also described the Iran nuclear deal and the Trans-Pacific partnership as the worst deals in history.] The â€™s Ashifa Kassam reports from Toronto: David MacNaughton, Canadaâ€™s ambassador to Washington, said on Wednesday the federal government was prepared to revisit the 1994 pact. â€œI think any agreement can be improved on,â€\\x9d he told reporters. â€œIf they want to have a discussion about improving Nafta, then we are ready to come to the table to try to put before the new administration anything that will benefit both Canada and the United States and obviously Mexico also,â€\\x9d said MacNaughton. â€œSo we are prepared to talk.â€\\x9d Throughout the American election campaign, Trump vowed to renegotiate Nafta in order to secure a better deal for American workers. If this proved impossible, Trump said he would withdraw the US from the agreement. Doing so could wreak havoc on the Canadian economy, which in 2015 sent 77% of its exports to the United States. MacNaughton declined to offer details on what Canada would seek from the negotiations, save for noting that free trade on lumber, which has long ranked as an irritant between the two countries, would be among Canadaâ€™s demands. His remarks came hours before Justin Trudeau, Canadaâ€™s prime minister, spoke to Trump to congratulate him on his win and invite him to visit Canada. The president-elect is on the ground in Washington. No protesters yet at the White House in anticipation of Trumpâ€™s visit. Amnesty International is launching a billboard in Times Square today asking people to to post selfies in support of refugees. The billboard, by Amnesty International and media platform The Drum, hopes to challenge racism and xenophobia around refugees. The relevance of the billboard launching the same week that Donald Trump, who promises to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants and tighten screening around Syrian refugees, didnâ€™t go unnoticed. From the press release: Drum founder Gordon Young, who will be in Times Square to celebrate the billboard going live, today offered an open invitation to Donald Trump to attend the unveiling and show his support, â€œCongratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump. Now that he has succeeded, it is time to demonstrate how the responsibility of office can change campaigning rhetoric into real leadership. We invite him to extend an olive branch to refugees - Mexican or otherâ€\\x9d Every media organization is publishing its version of â€œhow Trump won,â€\\x9d and this snippet from Time magazine is particularly interesting, looking at Trump voters in Pennsylvania: Chris Reilly, a commissioner in York County, Pennsylvania, has lived in the heavily Republican area north of Baltimore for 28 years. On the day in September after Mike Pence spoke to some 800 folks in downtown York, Reilly scanned a panoramic picture of the crowd in the local paper and had a shock. â€œI recognized one face,â€\\x9d he said. Thatâ€™s when the party stalwart knew something was going on. Then, on a recent Friday, Reilly got word that the county had received 9,000 absentee-ballot applications in a single day. It had to mail them out by Monday but had no money for extra help. So Reilly turned up at the election office on Saturday to stuff the applications into envelopes himself. As he did, he noticed something surprising. The applications were running 10 to 1 male. And when he peeked at the employment lines, he saw a pattern. â€œDockworker. Forklift operator. Roofer,â€\\x9d Reilly recalled. â€œGrouter. Warehouse stocker. These people had probably never voted before. They were coming out of nowhere.â€\\x9d Hillary Clinton is still leading in the popular vote, with 59,923,033 votes (47.7%) to Donald Trumpâ€™s 59,692,978. Thatâ€™s a pretty evenly split country, with just over 230,000 votes. The Federal Aviation Authority has listed Trump Tower in Midtown, home of Donald Trump, wife Melania and son Barron, in the no-fly zone. The FAA had placed â€œtemporary flight restrictions for VIP Movementâ€\\x9d on the area for election night but has now extended it indefinitely after Trumpâ€™s win. The area of Trump Tower is now, as New York magazine pointed out, a national-security site: The agency issued an administrative directive called a â€œNotice to Airmenâ€\\x9d banning pilots from flying within two nautical miles of the geographical point located at 40Âº45â€™54â€\\x9d north, 73Âº58â€™25â€\\x9d west â€” that being the southeastern corner of Central Park, four blocks north of Trump Tower. As we prepare for President Obama to welcome President-elect Trump to the White House, letâ€™s just enjoy this photo doing the rounds of social media of Obamaâ€™s staff listening to their boss make a gracious speech about Trumpâ€™s win. So perhaps Rudy Guiliani, former NYC mayor and one of Trumpâ€™s most ardent surrogates, wonâ€™t be Attorney General in the Trump administration. New Jersey Governor Chris Christieâ€™s name is also being thrown around as possible AG contender. From the â€™s Moscow correspondent... Russiaâ€™s deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov has said Moscowâ€™s emissaries were in touch with people around the Trump campaign during the election process, despite repeated denials from the Trump campaign that such links existed. Ryabkov told Interfax theyâ€™ve reached out to Trump since his election win. â€œWe are doing this and we have been doing so during the election campaign. Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage. Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives. We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes,â€\\x9d Ryabkov said. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed to Bloomberg that Russian embassy staff met with Trump associates during the campaign, and said people around the Clinton campaign had rejected such contacts. It is not particularly surprising that Russian representatives would have made overtures to Trump during the campaign; it is standard practice in all election campaigns. It is interesting that Ryabkov has chosen to say this publicly, however, given the role alleged Russian interference played in the campaign and given Trumpâ€™s campaign publicly denied such contacts. Vice-president Joe Biden will meet with VP-elect Mike Pence at the White House at 2.45pm today. Thousands of Americans took to the streets in protest of the election of Donald Trump last night, chanting â€œnot my presidentâ€\\x9d and shutting down roadways. Cities including Los Angeles, New York, Washington DC and Philadelphia all saw large protest turnout. Reporters Sam Levin in San Francisco, Zach Stafford in Chicago and Scott Bixby in New York covered last nightâ€™s protests. As night fell in midtown Manhattan, people took over Sixth Avenue and marched by Trump Tower, carrying signs that read â€œNot my presidentâ€\\x9d, â€œShe got more votesâ€\\x9d and â€œHands off my pussyâ€\\x9d, a reference to a leaked recording where Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because of his fame. A number of arrests were made. Protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square â€“ some 35 blocks downtown â€“ continued past Trump Tower, with a crowd congregating in front of the president-electâ€™s building. â€œFuck your tower! Fuck your wall!â€\\x9d people chanted at Trump Towerâ€™s brass-escutcheoned facade, as scores of NYPD officers manned barricades, behind which stood eight department of sanitation trucks filled with dirt.

Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright has warned Trump against American isolationism, telling him the US must play its part in the Nato alliance. â€œNato is obviously key. We are responsible for each other, a two-way street,â€\\x9d Albright told the in an interview on Wednesday. Trump alarmed many in July when, at the Republican national convention where he accepted his partyâ€™s nomination, he implied that the US might not protect other members of Nato if they were not contributing enough to the military costs, and hinted he could withdraw US forces from around the world. A cornerstone of Natoâ€™s strength, and global security, is the pact that an attack on one member is an attack on all. â€œThe US must be involved abroad. If we are not engaged, then the system doesnâ€™t work at all, or, even, a new system cannot be created,â€\\x9d she said. Many Ukrainians feel they were let down in the level of support they received from the west for fighting Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country, but a Donald Trump presidency brings a whole new level of fear, writes Shaun Walker. What really terrifies Kiev is the fact that Trump has hinted he could be amenable to the sort of Great Power politics that Putin enjoys: man-to-man summitry where geopolitical deals are struck. G Given the importance of Ukraine to Putinâ€™s plans, he would be likely to demand the country is recognised as one where Russia has â€œspecial interestsâ€\\x9d. In Putinâ€™s dream world and Kievâ€™s nightmare, the recognition of annexed Crimea as part of Russia could even be up for discussion. A somewhat nervous statement was issued by Ukrainian president Poroshenko, congratulating Trump and noting he had been assured by the US ambassador that the incoming Trump administration â€œwould remain a reliable partner in the struggle for democracyâ€\\x9d. In reality, nobody knows what Trumpâ€™s position on Russia and Ukraine will be, including the US ambassador. As on so many policy positions, Trump has made contradictory statements, at times suggesting more should have been done to support Ukraine against Russia while at other times suggesting Crimea should be part of Russia. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for clarity from on issues in which Trumpâ€™s campaign remarks have rattled Europe, including s global trade, climate policy and future relations with Nato. â€œWe would like to know how things will proceed with global trade policy,â€\\x9d Juncker said at a business event in Berlin, according to Reuters. â€œWe would like to know what intentions he has regarding the (Nato) alliance. We must know what climate policies he intends to pursue. This must be cleared up in the next few months.â€\\x9d Juncker said he did not expect the trade deal between the United States and the European Union, currently being negotiated, to be finalised this year as previously planned. â€œThe trade deal with the United States, I do not view that as something that would happen in the next two years,â€\\x9d he said. A Russian diplomat says Moscow had contacts with the Trump campaign ahead of the election, AP reports. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as telling the Interfax news agency that â€œthere were contactsâ€\\x9d with influential people in Trumpâ€™s circle. â€œI donâ€™t say that all of them, but a whole array of them, supported contacts with Russian representatives.â€\\x9d The report did not elaborate. Russia was openly accused of interfering in favour of Trump during the campaign. The Obama administration claimed Russian authorities hacked damaging Democratic party emails that were then leaked to WikiLeaks. Russian president Vladimir Putin denied the claims. After Trumpâ€™s election he was quick to call for a new era of â€œfully fledged relationsâ€\\x9d between Washington and Moscow. The American Civil Liberties Union is trying to tap into anxiety about civil liberties under Trump to raise some cash. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has spoken of his determination to dismantle Obamaâ€™s flagship health insurance policy as soon as possible. After speaking to Trump, McConnell said: â€œItâ€™s pretty high on our agenda, as you know. I would be shocked if we didnâ€™t move forward and keep our commitment to the American people.â€\\x9d During the campaign Trump promised to immediately repeal Obamacare. But some commentators predict he may get cold feet because such a move would leave millions of Americans without health cover, and he has no alternative to help them. Pundits on The Weeds, Voxâ€™s policy podcast, suggested he may be deploy a constantly extended sunset clause to keep Obamacare going. Meanwhile, health campaigners have pledged to wage â€œtotal warâ€\\x9d in defence of Obamacare, according to Politico. In the UK chancellor Philip Hammond, is anxious that Trumpâ€™s protectionism could damage Britain. Hammond was asked by the BBC if he thought free trade deals needed to be fundamentally rethought, as Trump suggests. He suggested he didnâ€™t: We believe that free trade and open markets are good for prosperity, good for the protection of jobs in this economy. But we do also recognise the concerns that there are around dumping and unfair practices, and itâ€™s about getting the right balance in the global trading system so that we can have the benefits of open markets, while being properly and appropriately protected from unfair practices. Andrew Sparrow is following this and all the other Trump fallout in British politics at Politics Live. It was white women who pushed Trump to victory, according to exit poll data. Rejecting the candidate who had aimed to be Americaâ€™s first female president, 53% of white women voted for Trump, according to CNN exit polls. White women without a college degree supported Trump over Hillary Clinton by nearly a two to one margin. White women with a college degree were more evenly divided, with 45% supporting Trump, compared with 51% supporting Clinton. Women of color, in contrast, voted overwhelmingly for Clinton: 94% of black women supported her, and 68% of Latino women. While exit polling data has flaws, the early responses underline a stark racial divide among American women: the majority of white women embraced Trump and his platform, while women of color rejected him. The strong support for Trump among white women suggests that many of them, if not â€œovertly racistâ€\\x9d, simply â€œdonâ€™t think racism is a big dealâ€\\x9d, said Mikki Kendall, a feminist cultural critic. Politics Weekly, The â€™s political podcast, analyses Trumpâ€™s victory and looks ahead to a Trump presidency. Anushka Asthana is joined by Gary Younge, Randeep Ramesh, Hannah Peaker and Mona Chalabi Donald Trump is heading for the White House today after being elected as the 45th US president. Barack Obama is still in charge for now but he will host President-elect Trump at a meeting in the Oval Office as part of the transition of power. The meeting at (11am EST) could be an awkward encounter after what was said during a bitter campaign in which Obama branded Trump â€œunfitâ€\\x9d for the presidency and â€œwoefully unpreparedâ€\\x9d. But part of Obamaâ€™s job now is to help prepare Trump for the presidency and he has urged Americanâ€™s to respect the shock election result. Speaking from White House he said: â€œThatâ€™s what the country needs â€“ a sense of unity; a sense of inclusion; a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law; and a respect for each other.â€\\x9d But many have been in no mood heed that call for unity. Thousands of demonstrators crowded into streets and surrounding his buildings in major American cities on Wednesday night, shouting â€œnot my president.â€\\x9d Some held banners saying â€œShe got more votesâ€\\x9d a reference to Hillary Clinton appearing poised to win the popular vote. Bernie Sanders reacted to Trumpâ€™s victory by acknowledging that he successfully tapped into antiestablishment rage but Sanders vowed to continue to challenge him. And international leaders have also been struggling in their own way to come to terms with Trumpâ€™s victory. Hereâ€™s some key questions weâ€™ve been asking - and answering - since Trumpâ€™s victory. Who will be appointed to Trumpâ€™s cabinet? Will Trump destroy America? Why were the polls so wrong? How did the worldâ€™s press cover Trumpâ€™s victory? What will President Trump do? Readers outside the US: what does Trumpâ€™s win mean to you? Did the Simpsons really predict a Trump victory? Whatâ€™s happening today The current and future first ladies, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump will also meet in the White House. Wonder if there will be chats about plagiarism? A US judge accused of bias by Donald Trump because of his Mexican heritage is to hold a pre-trial hearing on Thursday in a class-action lawsuit over the president-electâ€™s now-defunct Trump University. US district judge Gonzalo Curiel is holding the hearing to instruct the jury and examine what evidence to allow at trial, which begins on 28 November. Presidents enjoy immunity from their official duties, but this does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has spoken to the president elect by phone and is due to meet him in New York next week. Trumpâ€™s unexpected victory has fanned Japanâ€™s anxiety about Washingtonâ€™s commitment to security arrangements in the face of a rising China and a volatile North Korea. Asia-Pacific markets staged a huge recovery after an election day wobble, as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. There has been a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New Zealand. In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 56,300 visits from the US â€“ a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300.\",\n",
              "  'Elvis & Nixon review: Michael Shannon resurrects the King The meeting between Richard M Nixon and Elvis Presley on 21 December 1970, is so legendary that the photograph that immortalized the moment is still the most requested image in the National Archives. Itâ€™s a wonder, then, that itâ€™s taken this long to imagine their summit on screen. Writers Joey Sagal, Hanala Sagal and Cary Elwes take major artistic liberties to retell the story of that the encounter and the events leading up to it in Elvis & Nixon, a breezy comedy nimbly directed by Liza Johnson (Hateship Loveship). Given that the film is about two of the most recognizable figures of the 20th century, clearly casting is key to its success. Luckily, Johnson hit the jackpot by getting Michael Shannon on board as the King and Kevin Spacey to play the corrupt president. Although the filmâ€™s title suggests that it will be a two-hander, Nixon takes a back seat for much of the narrative to let Shannon take the lead as the King. His Presley is a star at a crossroads, firmly aware of his celebrity but having lost sight of himself as a person. â€œWhen I walk into a room, everyone remembers their first kiss watching one of my movies, but they never see me,â€\\x9d he laments. â€œHeâ€™s buried under gold and money. I donâ€™t know if I know who he is anymore.â€\\x9d Probably in an effort to solve that conundrum (though he never explicitly says as much), Presley sets out on a mission to put his fame to use by vowing to fight for his country, which he believes to be in shambles with the Vietnam war raging and drugs flooding the country. Declaring â€œitâ€™s make or break time for this country,â€\\x9d he flies to the White House with the lofty goal of convincing the president to deputise him as â€œfederal agent-at-largeâ€\\x9d. In these opening scenes, Shannon manages to immediately pass as Elvis by grounding the icon in some semblance of reality â€“ no small feat. He mildly modifies his voice and adopts some staccato mannerisms to resemble the Presley we know, but his interpretation succeeds largely because of his bold choice to underplay everything. Nothing in his Presley seems affected â€“ he plays him raw to the bone. Spacey, given much less to do in the film, takes the opposite approach and goes broad. Because his appearance is so fleeting, it works. Playing Nixon strictly as a larger-than-life character serves to highlight Presley as the filmâ€™s lead. When the pair finally meet eye-to-eye (Nixon concedes to the meeting in an effort to appeal to the youth vote and get an autograph for his daughter), the stark contrast between the two provides Elvis & Nixon with its biggest laughs. However, Johnsonâ€™s film falters when it veers from its titular duo to focus on the tangential ones who were along for the ride. Colin Hanks is amusing to watch as the stressed-out Nixon staffer who orchestrates the main event. But a side plot involving Presleyâ€™s friend, Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer), and his desperate need to return back to Los Angeles to propose to his girlfriend (Sky Ferreira) falls completely flat. When you have two of todayâ€™s best working actors acting on a high-wire to do justice to two of the most recognisable figures of the 20th century, itâ€™s best to keep the focus solely located on them.',\n",
              "  \"Michael Bay's Benghazi movie 13 Hours is 'inaccurate', according to CIA officer Michael Bay has assured audiences that his Libyan-set military thriller 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is an accurate retelling of the events surrounding the terrorist attack in Benghazi in 2013, which resulted in the death of four people, including the US ambassador to Libya. But according to the CIA officer in charge of the American intelligence agencyâ€™s top-secret Benghazi facility that night, one of the most important moments of the film is entirely wrong. â€œThere never was a stand-down order,â€\\x9d the officer â€“ the former chief of the so-called Annex who identified himself as â€˜Bobâ€™ â€“ told the Washington Post. â€œAt no time did I ever second-guess that the team would depart.â€\\x9d The scene in question features the fictionalized version of Bob ordering his security team to â€œstand downâ€\\x9d rather than attempt to rescue the diplomat, then missing in the wake of an attack on the nearby American consulate. Not only was the stand-down order never given, Bob said, but nothing he said in the aftermath of the consulate siege could even be â€œinterpreted as equivalentâ€\\x9d to such an order. â€œI thought I would regret it if I didnâ€™tâ€\\x9d speak out about the inaccuracies, Bob said. â€œSo much of this information has been wrong.â€\\x9d Although Bob has not yet seen the film, which is based on a book co-written by US contractors hired to protect the Annex, he said he was familiar with the contents of both the film and the book. Despite Bayâ€™s claims that 13 Hours has â€œno political agendaâ€\\x9d beyond a faithful retelling of the events in Benghazi, studio sources told the Hollywood Reporter that the thriller is being marketed specifically to conservative audiences, including advertising and press in right-leaning media outlets and the choice of demographically friendly â€œred stateâ€\\x9d audiences for pre-release screenings. For example, lead actor John Krasinski gave an exclusive interview to the conservative Townhall.com, and television advertisements for the film ran multiple times during Thursday nightâ€™s Republican presidential primary debate on the Fox Business Network. When asked how his film deals with the stand-down order â€“ an anecdote that was debunked by the US Senate select committee on intelligenceâ€™s 15 January 2014 review of the attacks â€“ Bay said said that his film is even-handed. â€œIt does deal with the stand-down order, but I show both sides of the story,â€\\x9d Bay told the Hollywood Reporter. â€œI met with the CIA on this movie and I show the whole situation.â€\\x9d According to Bay, the research he did into the lead-up to the attack and its aftermath was more comprehensive than anything cinema goers have seen in the news media. â€œYou donâ€™t hear it on the talking points on the news,â€\\x9d Bay continued. â€œThis is a much more in-depth look at whatâ€™s going on inside that CIA base, and it shows it from both sides,â€\\x9d he said.\",\n",
              "  'New band of the week: Starchild & The New Romantic (No 100) Hometown: Harlem. The lineup: Bryndon Cook (vocals, music). The background: As though by magic â€¦ Of course thereâ€™s no substitute for the real thing, but Bryndon Cook, AKA Starchild & The New Romantic, does a fair approximation of 1980s Prince at his most synthy and slow. The 23-year-old New Yorker sings of â€œraptureâ€\\x9d on the opening track to his debut EP, Crucial, but this is exaltation with a side order of sad. Itâ€™s almost as though Cook could see what was coming. Listening to the eight tracks on Crucial is like hearing an extended tribute to the purple deity. He even took the title of the EP from a bootleg of studio out-takes apocryphally credited to Prince and Miles Davis. Itâ€™s not all Prince worship. Cook grew up loving everyone from Sade to George Clinton. Starchild is partially attributed to a name from P-Funk mythology â€“ something about an alien who arrives by spacecraft to bring the Holy Funk â€“ and nods to Cookâ€™s upbringing in a house across the street from the Nasa Headquarters in Greenbelt. Coming from the state of Maryland also meant exposure to go-go, jazz and gospel (â€œMy roots,â€\\x9d says Cook), though he spent four formative years in Atlanta, home of black futurism (not to mention Future). He continued to look far and wide for other influences: his first mixtape was called Rad! and featured him rapping over David Axelrod and Washed Out. In the last couple of years, he has worked with Solange, Kindness, and Chairlift as touring guitarist, and has collaborated with Dev Hynes. But Prince is his primary influence, and he freely admits it. â€œI look at him as a whole genre,â€\\x9d he says. â€œWithin the genre of Prince, there is so much to discover.â€\\x9d Like his idol, Starchild played and recorded every note of Crucial on his own, on his laptop. He gives the music a wooziness, like soul with a chillwave gauze (Cook was once an intern at Pitchfork), and keeps it mainly â€“ as we said â€“ nice and slow. Thereâ€™s a good reason for this: he calls what he does Champion Music for the Heartbroken, describing his songs as â€œdiary entries from the end of my teenage years, where Iâ€™m trying to reconcile heartbreak and rejection with escapismâ€\\x9d. He adds: â€œI always appreciated music that lent a helping hand and said, â€˜Hey, are you with me? Because I am with you.â€™ I hope I can do that for someone, somewhere. If Iâ€™m lucky.â€\\x9d All My Lovers is like Purple Rain on downers, although as with most soundalikes, the closer you inspect it, the less it sounds like the artist itâ€™s paying homage to, and the more it assumes an identity of its own. Still, this is definitely Prince-like, if not Prince-lite. Slamminâ€™ Mannequin is the one fast song, moving at I Would Die 4 U pace. It sounds as though Cook went out and bought a Linn drum and some of the other equipment Prince used to record his early-â€™80s output, especially Purple Rain. Listen out for the fiery, fierce guitar solo at the end. Love Interlude features waves of synth while Cook uses his falsetto to impressive effect. Womanâ€™s Dress finds Starchild in self-doubting mood (â€œWill I ever be enough for you?â€\\x9d), while New Romantic is an object lesson in how to construct the perfect 80s slow jam, all shimmery synths and rubbery bassline. The title track ends the EP as it began, with Starchild lost in a synth murk. Itâ€™s as though Cook anticipated the tragic events of 21 April , 2016 before he made this glorious, stately yet sorrowful â€œcomputer blueâ€\\x9d music. Itâ€™s one way to remember Prince. The buzz: â€œIn the style of his personal lodestar, Prince, Cook performed and recorded Crucial entirely on his own.â€\\x9d The truth: Baby, heâ€™s a star(child). Most likely to: Die 4 U. Least likely to: Go crazy. What to buy: The Crucial EP is out now on Ghostly International. File next to: Prince, Dev Hynes, Frank Ocean, Shamir. Links: facebook.com/thisisstarchild. Ones to watch: Globelamp, Kllo, Demotaped, Colour, Charlotte Day Wilson.',\n",
              "  'Yeezus rises: Kanye West releases remix of The Life of Pablo song on Easter Sunday In the latest of Kanye Westâ€™s GOOD Friday releases, the artist also known as Yeezus has marked Easter Sunday with an alternate version of his song Ultralight Beam. Ultralight Prayer includes an extended cameo by the gospel singer Kirk Franklin, who was featured on the original version of the song. While Ultralight Beam was about Westâ€™s faith in God â€“ including lyrics such as â€œIâ€™m tryna keep my faith / But Iâ€™m looking for more / Somewhere I can feel safe / And end my holy warâ€\\x9d â€“ the new version is solely centred around an impassioned prayer by the gospel musician and author, and reads as below: Father, This prayer is for everyone that feels theyâ€™re not good enough This prayerâ€™s for everybody that feels theyâ€™re too messed up For everyone that feels theyâ€™ve said â€˜Iâ€™m sorryâ€™ too many times Let them know thatâ€™s why you took the nail So we could have eternal life If all Godâ€™s children would get down on their knees and pray And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again But I wonâ€™t make it, God, if you let go of my hand Thatâ€™s why we need more faith Yes, Iâ€™m searching for you, Iâ€™m looking for more Yes I am, in your arms is where I feel safe Theyâ€™re killing our babies in the streets, I call out for war I need just a little bit more of some faith Just a mustard seed, Iâ€™m looking for you, for more Prayer for our homes and our families We just wanna be safe Canâ€™t you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear war Itâ€™s just the latest extension of Westâ€™s new album, The Life of Pablo. The rapper has primarily been using Jay Zâ€™s streaming service Tidal to upload variations of songs on the record (the song below is also available on Soundcloud). West has described the album as â€œa living, breathing, changing creative expressionâ€\\x9d, and has periodically added edits of songs such as Wolves and Famous.',\n",
              "  'Louis van Gaal admits â€˜sadâ€™ Manchester United unlikely to make top four Louis van Gaal admitted Manchester United are unlikely to secure a top-four finish and described his sideâ€™s 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Sunderland as a sad day for the club. Van Gaal lamented that United failed to cope with the home sideâ€™s aggression. â€œI have told the players the top four will be very difficult now,â€\\x9d said the United manager, whose team are six points behind Manchester City, who are in the final Champions League spot. â€œYou cannot close your eyes to that. Itâ€™s still possible but very difficult. We needed the points so much, everybody is very sad.â€\\x9d Wayne Rooney suggested that it would now be easier for United to earn a place in next seasonâ€™s Champions League by winning the Europa League. â€œIt will be very difficult to qualify for the Champions League through the top four now. We know that. Itâ€™s a sad day for us,â€\\x9d said the United captain. â€œWinning the Europa League might be the only way we can get into it.â€\\x9d Van Gaal conceded that such an achievement will be not be straightforward. â€œThe Europa League is easier for us but also not so [easy] because there is a fantastic level of European football in that cup.â€\\x9d Unitedâ€™s Europa League campaign, after they dropped down from the Champions League, starts on Thursday with the first leg of their last-32 tie against Midtjylland in Denmark. United had come undone in the face of Wahbi Khazriâ€™s excellent set-piece execution â€“ Sunderlandâ€™s Tunisian playmaker scored one goal straight from a free-kick and delivered the corner that led to the winner, with Lamine KonÃ©â€™s header going in off David de Gea. Van Gaal is well aware that the talk about JosÃ© Mourinho succeeding him at Old Trafford in the summer is most certainly not going to go away after Unitedâ€™s first defeat at the Stadium of Light. Damningly, Unitedâ€™s points and goals scored tally is their lowest at this stage of a campaign in the Premier League era. â€œWe can only blame ourselves,â€\\x9d said Van Gaal, who did at least see Anthony Martial score a fine equaliser before his players folded under Sunderlandâ€™s second-half onslaught. â€œYou have to win this type of game but we could not cope with Sunderlandâ€™s aggression and set pieces. We didnâ€™t deliver and we feel disappointed and we feel sad. But we are working together.â€\\x9d When asked if he was feeling the pressure, the Dutchmanâ€™s reply suggested a measure of resignation. â€œNo,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIâ€™m doing my work and I can do no more.â€\\x9d He accepts, though, that his best currently represents underachievement. â€œYou cannot close your eyes from the top four being a minimum requirement. As Manchester United you have to keep the ball in spite of the pressure of Sunderland and create chances, but we didnâ€™t have control.â€\\x9d The result meant Sunderland ended a bad week with a measure of satisfaction, moving to a point below 17th-placed Norwich. The club sacked Adam Johnson after the winger pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. They head for a training break in Dubai within touching distance of safety and Allardyce was delighted to see his Â£14m investment in Khazri, from Bordeaux, and KonÃ©, a centre-half from Lorient, pay dividends. â€œOur new players have made a massive contribution and hopefully that bodes well for the rest of the season,â€\\x9d he said. â€œToday showed me the squad is good enough to get out of the trouble weâ€™re in. It was a really good performance with the right result. Weâ€™re getting better.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Iain Duncan Smith: David Cameron's EU deal will do nothing to reduce migration David Cameron is campaigning to keep Britain in the EU on the basis of a deal that will do nothing to reduce net migration to the UK, and may actually lead to a sharp increase in arrivals as people try to beat an emergency welfare brake, Iain Duncan Smith has said. As Downing Street came under fire from the lord chancellor and justice secretary, Michael Gove, who questioned whether the EU deal was legally binding, the work and pensions secretary said the deal showed Britain still had no controls over its borders. In an interview on the eve of the release of the latest migration statistics, Duncan Smith said that he has warned the prime minister in private that a failure to control immigration would only encourage the equivalent of the French Front National. â€œIf you do not control your borders my observation is that you get parties led by people like Marine Le Pen and others who feed off the back of this, and ordinary decent people feel life is out of control,â€\\x9d the work and pensions secretary said. The statistics are likely to fuel the debate over immigration to Britain from the EU, one of the most contentious topics in the referendum. But Downing Street received a boost on Wednesday night when Christine Lagarde, the French managing director of the IMF, warned of the dangers of a UK exit from the EU. â€œMy hunch â€¦ is that it is bound to be a negative on all fronts,â€\\x9d she told CNN. Duncan Smith has now become the second cabinet â€œouterâ€\\x9d to raise questions about the EU deal after No 10 was forced onto the defensive following Goveâ€™s claim the agreement could be overruled by the European court of justice. Gove and Duncan Smith spoke out after Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, issued fresh guidelines that banned officials from providing ministers backing the leave campaign access to departmental documents drawn up since the prime minister agreed his EU deal. The understands the guidelines were drawn up with the specific intention of preventing Duncan Smith from commissioning officials to carry out research to prove his doubts about the welfare elements of the EU deal. But Duncan Smith showed that he still remains a potent force in the referendum campaign when he told the that the deal would do nothing to bring down net immigration. Stressing that he did not know the figures to be released on Thursday, he said: â€œI would lay even money that they follow the trend over the past two quarters showing an ever-increasing number of migrants from eastern Europe. So is this agreement negotiated in Brussels going to limit the numbers coming into the UK? My answer to that is no. The truth is, there is one clear way that we could be sure to deliver on that manifesto commitment â€“ and thatâ€™s to regain control of our borders.â€\\x9d The work and pensions secretary offered some support for the prime minister by saying that a four-year emergency brake to limit access to in-work benefits for EU migrants, which can remain in force for seven years, will â€œsend a signalâ€\\x9d that people should contribute before claiming benefits. But he said the new system could actually increase migration as workers seek to beat a deadline. Noting that the brake will not come into force until April 2017 at the earliest, he said: â€œAnyone with any thought of coming to work in the UK in the foreseeable future will have a motivation to get over here and establish residency (even if only for a week) as that would in all likelihood qualify them for an exemption from the brake later.â€\\x9d Britain may even find that the European Commission and European parliament may be in no mood to help out after a yes vote. Warning that Britain can only guarantee the reforms if it threatens to hold a second referendum, he said: â€œBy that stage [after a yes vote] the pressure is off for them to do anything. We are reliant on their good will. They may well decide they have no need to rush this through and they can fiddle with it to suit them. Unless we are planning a second referendum, we are in the EUâ€™s hands.â€\\x9d Duncan Smith was scathing about one of the key elements of the deal â€“ the plan to index child benefit to the cost of living in an EU migrantâ€™s home country. He warned that the new system would be â€œfiendishly complicatedâ€\\x9d and was â€œbound to cost moreâ€\\x9d than the â€œrelatively tinyâ€\\x9d Â£30m that goes on child benefit to EU migrants. â€œIf you have a Polish national (cue HMRC working out cost of living in Warsaw), who says that actually their child is resident in a country with higher cost of living ... then how the hell would you check this/ police itâ€\\x9d? Duncan Smith, a member of the cabinet committee on the EU negotiations â€“ some of whose members felt they were not properly briefed by the prime minister â€“ warned that George Osborneâ€™s new national living wage would act as a â€œsignificant pull factorâ€\\x9d. Downing Street has prompted Duncan Smith to revise a long-standing calculation â€“ that Britainâ€™s in-work benefits do not encourage migration â€“ after the European-wide publicity of what he regards as Britainâ€™s generous system. â€œIt may well be because there has been so much publicity in countries like Poland and in eastern Europe generally that some people know more about our benefits system than they did. Certainly there has been a lot of publicity â€“ a highly proficient awareness raising campaign. Do people react to publicity? They do. It was not the purpose of the negotiations, of course, but it may be one of the by-products is that we see an increase in people coming here.â€\\x9d The intervention by Duncan Smith caps a difficult 48 hours for Downing Street, after the prime minister upset the Leave camp by humiliating Boris Johnson in the Commons by suggesting that he was motivated by personal ambition. In one of the biggest blows to No 10, it was forced to apologise to General Sir Michael Rose, the former SAS commander, after wrongly including him in a list of former military chiefs who oppose the UK leaving the EU.\",\n",
              "  'UK health experts call for ban on tackling in school rugby More than 70 doctors and health experts have called for a ban on tackling in school rugby games. In an open letter that warns of the high risk of serious injury among under-18s playing rugby, they urge schools to move to touch and non-contact versions of the game. A government drive to boost participation in rugby in English schools by linking them with rugby clubs is also criticised by the health experts, who point out that the UN convention on the rights of the child obliges governments to inform children about injury risks. The letter â€“ which is addressed to ministers, chief medical officers and childrenâ€™s commissioners â€“ describes rugby as a â€œhigh-impact collision sportâ€\\x9d. â€œThe majority of all injuries occur during contact or collision, such as the tackle and the scrum,â€\\x9d it says. â€œThese injuries, which include fractures, ligamentous tears, dislocated shoulders, spinal injuries and head injuries ,can have short-term, life-long and life-ending consequences for children.â€\\x9d The letter is the first stage of a campaign that will include a petition on the change.org website which, if it receives 100,000 signatures, will trigger the consideration of a debate by MPs on the issue. Rugby is a compulsory part of the physical education curriculum from the age of 11 in many boysâ€™ schools, particularly in the independent sector. The letter, signed by sport scholars, academics, doctors and public health professionals, says repeat concussions have been found to have a link to cognitive impairment, and an association with problems such as depression, memory loss and diminished verbal abilities. Children also took longer to recover to normal levels on measures of memory, reaction speed and post-concussive symptoms. The signatories included Prof Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health research and policy at Queen Mary University of London, who has campaigned about the dangers of rugby. Stating that children are being exposed to serious and catastrophic risk of injury, she said: â€œParents expect the state to look after their children when they are at school. Rugby is a high-impact collision sport and given that children are more susceptible to injuries such as concussion, the absence of injury surveillance systems and primary prevention strategies is worrying.â€\\x9d Eric Anderson, a professor of sport, masculinities and sexualities at the University of Winchester, said the signatories did not have a contention with rugby, but with the collisions that occur in the sport. â€œSchool children should not be forced to collide with other children as part of the national curriculum for physical education,â€\\x9d he said. â€œA more sensible approach is to play tag rugby.â€\\x9d A Department for Education spokeswoman saidschools were expected to be aware of the risks associated with sporting activities and to provide a safe environment for pupils. â€œTeam sports, such as rugby, play an important role in developing character,â€\\x9d she said. â€œThey can help children and young people develop positive traits, such as fair play, leadership and resilience, and teach them how to bounce back from defeat, how to respect others and how to work together in teams to achieve a goal. â€œWe have given schools the flexibility to organise and deliver a diverse and challenging PE curriculum which best suits the needs of their students.â€\\x9d The Rugby Football Union said it took player safety â€œextremely seriouslyâ€\\x9d and that recent changes meant young players underwent a â€œgradual and managedâ€\\x9d introduction to the contact version of the game. A spokesman said the union had also carried out a three-year injury prevention and surveillance study on schoolboy injuries, as well as implementing a guidance programme known as RugbySafe. He added: â€œWe believe that high quality coaching, officiating, medical support and appropriate player behaviour in line with the core values all contribute to reducing the risk of injury occurring.â€\\x9d â€¢ This article was amended on 2 March 2016. An earlier version referred to the petition on the government, rather than the change.org, website.',\n",
              "  'Alter Bridge: The Last Hero review â€“ exhausting bombast from arena-metal tryhards The main problem with Alter Bridgeâ€™s sixth album becomes apparent about six tracks in. Cradle to the Grave brings a few moments of delicate restraint to the party, but up to that point every last second of The Last Hero is purposefully, relentlessly bombastic, as if every fader has been shoved into the red. Still much heavier and more overtly metallic than their modern arena-rock peers, the Florida quartet have always made music designed to resonate around stadia, but 66 minutes of this kind of overwrought caterwauling is a little exhausting. That said, there are great songs here: opener Show Me a Leader is a dark, fiery anthem, The Other Side deftly salutes Metallicaâ€™s genre-defining crunch and Crows on a Wire is a fine showcase for guitarist Mark Tremontiâ€™s love of nasty thrash. It falls some way short of 2010â€™s ABIII â€“ still their best album by some distance â€“ but The Last Hero can hardly be decried as half-arsed. Itâ€™s just that there is such a thing as trying too hard.',\n",
              "  'JosÃ© Holebasâ€™ stunning strike lands spoils for Watford at Middlesbrough By the time the final whistle blew, the morningâ€™s clouds and rain had cleared to leave the splendour of the Cleveland Hills clearly visible from the main stand. The only problem for Aitor Karanka was that the sun elected to shine on Watford rather than his increasingly struggling side, with JosÃ© Holebasâ€™s glorious winning goal highlighting Middlesbroughâ€™s mounting problems. With Ã\\x81lvaro Negredo and GastÃ³n RamÃ\\xadrez once again letting themselves down, Karankaâ€™s horizon darkened appreciably as Boro rarely looked like curtailing a plummet down the table during which they have collected two points from six games and lost four of the past five. Their sole win came at Sunderlandâ€™s expense. Karanka blamed this latest setback on Watfordâ€™s ability to waste time â€“ a black art apparently cultivated by their manager, Walter Mazzarri â€“ but the visitors would not have been able to slow things down with such cute gamesmanship had Boro proved capable of stringing more than two consecutive passes together. â€œThey made it impossible to play our game, it was impossible for us,â€\\x9d lamented Karanka before defending his hallmark 4-2-3-1 system which some observers feel is turning into a straitjacket for Boroâ€™s players, partly explaining why they have not won at home since April. â€œWe have a style,â€\\x9d the Spaniard countered. â€œIâ€™ve built the squad to play that way, we won promotion with one up front. With that style we have a good chance. We have to keep going. Itâ€™s just October so we have a long time to go.â€\\x9d Mazzarri affected to be taken aback by the time-wasting accusations. â€œI donâ€™t know what he refers to,â€\\x9d he said. â€œHonestly, I donâ€™t think so.â€\\x9d The Italian then reminded everyone that Boroâ€™s Antonio BarragÃ¡n should have been sent off for a second yellow-card offence in the first half. â€œWe all know the rules and it was very evident. But I donâ€™t comment on referees.â€\\x9d Without a ball being kicked, the team-sheets alone created a measure of controversy. While Mazzarri preferred Isaac Successâ€™s attacking potential to that of Odion Ighalo, Karanka recalled Negredo and RamÃ\\xadrez, leaving Jordan Rhodes and Viktor Fischer warming the bench. When YounÃ¨s Kaboul â€“ operating on the right of Watfordâ€™s back three â€“ swiftly turned slapdash and conceded possession the former pair had a chance to show Boro fans what they were really capable of but, after exchanging passes with Negredo, RamÃ\\xadrez dragged a scuffed shot wide. Watford initially looked vulnerable but Boroâ€™s problem was that RamÃ\\xadrez â€“ deployed in the No10 position behind Negredo that is so key to Karankaâ€™s configuration â€“ seemed to have developed an unfortunate penchant for persistently picking the wrong pass. Even when he took a corner, the Uruguayan RamÃ\\xadrez overhit it, leaving the ball sailing out of play. Negredo was similarly off key but, in mitigation, that pair were hardly helped by Marten de Roonâ€™s lack of control in a midfield anchoring role. Seeking a lucky break, Boro appealed for a handball penalty against Nordin Amrabat but, correctly, Roger East, the referee, refused to buy it and boos rang around a stadium studded with empty red seats. The stay-aways quite possibly called it right. Although Watford improved as their formation gradually morphed from 3-4-3 to a defensive 5-4-1, the general standard was poor with far too many miscued passes and suspect first touches. If Karanka had reason to be content with Calum Chambersâ€™ and Ben Gibsonâ€™s containment of Troy Deeney, Boroâ€™s manager must have been relieved that BarragÃ¡n was not dismissed after committing that second bookable offence. Already handed a yellow card for hauling down Success, the right-back was fortunate to escape a second for pulling back the same player 10 minutes later. It seemed one of those afternoons when there would be more bookings than shots on target but Watford emphasised their efficiency by scoring with their first. Pouncing on a Boro clearance, Holebas took a steadying touch, before unleashing an elegant yet vicious 25-yard left-foot shot which defied the stretching VÃ\\xadctor ValdÃ©s en route to the top corner. After that it was all about Boroâ€™s lack of a Plan B and Watfordâ€™s Italianesque determination to hold on to the win. Perhaps fortunately for Karanka, local anger was directed towards East. â€œWeâ€™ve had some shit refs but you are the worst,â€\\x9d they chorused after Holebas tripped Chambers on the edge of the area and no penalty was awarded. Replays showed the contact came fractionally outside the box. Indeed, the referee was the wrong target; arguably Eastâ€™s only key mistake was not handing BarragÃ¡n a red card for that second bookable offence and, wisely, Karanka refrained from criticising him. Right now a manager who surely delayed too long in liberating Rhodes from the bench has bigger things to worry about.',\n",
              "  'Finally, someone at EDF sees the Â£18bn farce that is Hinkley Point Hallelujah, at last somebody close to Hinkley Point farce can see that the Â£18bn nuclear adventure makes no sense. EDFâ€™s finance director has quit rather than be associated with a project that â€“ we must assume â€“ he judges so financially risky that it could sink the French energy firm. Last week, the official line from the Anglo-French summit maintained that â€œmajor progressâ€\\x9d was being made in getting Hinkley towards sign-off. The reality, we can now see, is that there has been a major row and EDF remains mired in confusion. The good news is that Thomas Piquemalâ€™s resignation should oblige the governments of France and the UK to acknowledge the uncomfortable fact about Hinkley that, until now, they have preferred to brush away. Itâ€™s simple: EDFâ€™s nuclear technology for Hinkley hasnâ€™t been proven to work. Until it can be shown to be reliable, there will always be a material risk that the Somerset project becomes a disaster for both buyer and supplier. EDF is building two other reactors in Europe to the same European pressurised reactor (EPR) design and, instead of low-carbon nuclear power, both have produced only massive cost overruns. The plant in Finland is nine years late and the one in Flamanville in Normandy is four years behind schedule. EDFâ€™s crisis flows from those flops and Piquemalâ€™s analysis that the company canâ€™t afford to double-down on its EPR bet is surely correct. As it is, the debt-laden firmâ€™s share price has fallen 90% over the past decade and there are other calls on its capital and resources, not least Franceâ€™s nuclear power stations, which require an expensive upgrade. The now ex-finance director wanted the investment decision on Hinkley to be delayed by three years, which would be wise from EDFâ€™s point of view. The trouble is, the UK cannot afford yet more delays. Our crisis in energy generation will arrive in the mid-2020s and Hinkley, according to the official script, was supposed to do much more than merely produce 7% of the UKâ€™s energy. The plant was also intended to help develop the infrastructure to support other companiesâ€™ new nuclear plants. If Hinkley were to be delayed by three years, the UK hasnâ€™t got an energy policy worthy of the name. The latest saga should lead to a simple conclusion in Downing Street: EDF and its unreliable EPRs were always the wrong choice for the UK. Consider how many subsidies have already been promised to compensate for EDFâ€™s weaknesses and the unproven nature of its EPR. EDF was given 10 years to build Hinkley and the UK guaranteed to buy its output at twice the current wholesale price for 35 years in an inflation-linked contract. This was almost case of pricing in the cost over-runs and delays before they had even happened, with UK consumers footing the bill. The best approach now would be to call the whole thing off. EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard LÃ©vy may continue to whistle cheerfully about Hinkley but his company looks to be only one more resignation away from capitulation. Abandonment would be politically embarrassing for chancellor George Osborne (remember last yearâ€™s grovel for Chinese cash to shore up the financing) but it would be far worse to let this show drag on. If the UKâ€™s future is nuclear, there are alternative suppliers â€“ from Japan, the US, and China â€“ who have smaller models that can be built more quickly, but their willingness to commit capital wonâ€™t be encouraged by the sight of the current Hinkley shambles. If the future is non-nuclear, then get on with the job of making hard choices about the best infrastructure. Either way, the important thing for the UK is to have an energy policy that doesnâ€™t rely on paying top-dollar to an over-stretched supplier that hasnâ€™t been able to get its new kit to work. Banking reforms look set to disappoint The Competition and Markets Authorityâ€™s final report into the banking industry, due in May, will now appear in the dog days of August. This is not because the contents will be so frightening that leading bankers will need to lie down on the nearest beach. We already know the CMA has rejected structural reforms, such as a break-up of the big banks, in favour of technocratic fiddles, such as setting up a comparison website to encourage punters to shop around. Such a remedy was damned as feeble by most observers when it was announced at the interim stage last October. That, presumably, is why the CMA has given itself an extension to come up with something that sounds more chunky. Caps on overdraft charges and grace periods for customers to avoid the same charges may improve the lot of a few. But none of these late additions by the CMA will deliver a shot in the arm for competition in the banking industry. Blame Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank has turned the process of separating 300 Williams & Glyn branches into something resembling the labours of Hercules, thereby killing all appetite for further structural reform. Thus the â€œstrikingâ€\\x9d stability in market shares identified by the CMA is virtually guaranteed to be striking in another decadeâ€™s time. The interim report felt like a missed opportunity; prepare to be disappointed again. SNP donor in tax pickle Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish first minister and leader of Scottish National party, is a fierce opponent of the artificial tax tactics of some major companies. So, here you would think, is an open goal â€“ a court defeat for a Scottish company that used a complex scheme to wipe Â£11m off its tax bill. The company is Stagecoach, whose chairman, Sir Brian Souter, happens to have been a major donor to the SNP. Sturgeonâ€™s condemnation, one trusts, will be forthcoming anyway.',\n",
              "  'As publishers lose control, are newspaper websites a dead parrot? A truth is dawning on media owners (or in many cases it has dawned, but they donâ€™t like to talk about it). Publishing is over. Obviously this isnâ€™t true in its purest sense; publishing is actually flourishing, just not for publishers. As Facebook last week extended the reach of its instant articles to anyone, as Google invests in making news articles load lightning fast, as virtual reality can be produced by a Â£200 kit, it is fair to say we have more opportunity today to put out remarkable works of fact and fiction to the world than ever before. However, defining decisions about formats and revenue are dictated at platform level, Facebook and others, or at carrier level, or even, in the case of Appleâ€™s stance against the FBI, at device level. The biggest news for media owners in the UK last week was that a phone company, Three, is introducing adblocking across its network. Essentially this means that if you have a Three mobile phone, you will no longer see ads on the articles and pages you look at on your phone. Mobile advertising is still a very small revenue stream for most publishers, but in many cases it is the only one showing any growth. Phone companies such as Three see an opportunity to make more money and retain customers by purging annoying ads or making advertisers pay for the data consumption. Unless and until this is killed by the European regulators, it threatens to snuff out the lifeline of mobile advertising for digital publishers. Last week we also saw China, which is a hostile media market owing to censorship, announce that it would effectively ban any non-Chinese owned media from operating inside the country. India, in a very different way, asserted its own right to choose a separate path for its communications future when it ruled out Facebookâ€™s Free Basics. Regulation is increasingly being seen as the only way that any plurality or regional difference will be exerted over a media market which tolerates the micro, favours the mega and rolls over most entities in between. The mobile advertising market is already effectively owned by Facebook, so with the stick of adblocking and the carrot of instant articles publishers are finding themselves surrendering what were previously the most important parts of their businesses. Last week I spoke to numerous publishers who were largely though not exclusively in agreement on one thing: â€œWe know that the business of packaging and publishing by ourselves is over, the question for everyone now is what next?â€\\x9d, said one. Another noted â€œwe look at distribution for the social platforms and they are doing really well, we look at the opportunities for creation and they are plentiful, the piece in the middle, where traditional publishers and broadcasters sit, that doesnâ€™t look so great.â€\\x9d The prognostication game has hitherto been about the speed at which newspapers will go out of print. Now it shifts up a gear to the more pressing question of which companies will start to jettison websites and other digital infrastructure accumulated in the past two decades. Having a legacy business configured around a website is now almost as much of a headache as the rumbling printing press, fuelled by paper and money. It is likely we will start to see studio or agency models emerge where publishing models once were, trying to create value around relationships and services rather than packages and products. In a lengthy article praising publisher BuzzFeed as being the â€œworldâ€™s most innovative companyâ€\\x9d last week, its founder Jonah Peretti used Paramount Pictures as an example of a company he draw inspiration from. It was he said, a demonstration of how owning all the elements of the businesses, from cast to crew to theatres, fuelled creative success. The new paradigm however raises the question of whether that aspiration to scale can really ever exist again for a purely creative company. Part of the answer is already obvious, even the BuzzFeeds and BBCs of the world will struggle to gain leverage against gatekeepers, be they regulators, phone companies or distribution channels. As the pipes of distribution have merged with the advertising sales functions, the publishing tools and even the customer relations and data, the best a traditional publisher can hope for is that they will be favoured by the distributors or that they can build value separately. This is most likely to be through relationships with either advertisers or their own customers, hence the most closely watched models are those based on becoming a new type of advertising agency (BuzzFeed and Vice) or subscriptions based on brand loyalty (the New York Times). Given the disorienting speed of change and a dozen announcements a week that potentially upend your business model, maybe publishing is not in fact dead, but like the proverbial Monty Python parrot, lying on the floor of its cage, eyes screwed tightly shut.',\n",
              "  'Strikes have no winners â€“ and the junior doctorsâ€™ dispute is no exception Most strikes end sadly, and some â€“ like the minersâ€™ â€“ very badly. Junior doctors have yet to vote on the peace terms agreed by their leaders on Wednesday, but the odds are that most will accept. Yet they will stay angry, and with good reason. After eight strike days, the public has stayed staunchly supportive of their cause, even when they walked out of A&E, and even when tens of thousands of operations were cancelled. But there is an ebb and flow, a rhythm in the emotional rollercoaster of a strike, and the time feels right to call it a day â€“ before public support wanes, and when the junior doctors know their point about life within the NHS has been well made. But nearly all strikes end with a painful sense of giving in, by a workforce driven back to work â€“ even when they have won important concessions. The rhetoric, the political passion, the indignation all have to be toned down, in ways that make the workforce feel they are swallowing more pride than the employers are. It hurts â€“ and the bitterness lasts. Thatâ€™s why strikes are usually a bad thing, a last-resort breakdown in relations. The thrill of rebelling is intoxicating, but usually ends in burst-balloon disappointment. I have covered hundreds of strikes, but rarely seen happy workers marching back in with a sense of victory. The latest I wrote about was the well-justified strike by National Gallery staff: settlement didnâ€™t leave them a happier workforce. Jeremy Hunt provoked this strike, possibly deliberately, imagining he would emerge a hero to his party for taking on the â€œvested interestsâ€\\x9d of the public sector. But he ended up the political loser, with the public understanding the doctorsâ€™ alarm at the state of his NHS and the rising pressures on all who work in it. Digging through the details of the actual deal, neither side won. It looks more like a stalemate, with some changes around the edges. Huntâ€™s claim to have got seven-day working â€“ but with no new money, inside the same pay envelope while conceding on some of the more extreme antisocial-hours issues â€“ looks like magical accounting. Besides, during the course of this long strike, the original research suggesting 11,000 more patients die after admission at weekends has been decisively shredded: itâ€™s all in the different case-mix at weekends. Nor, if there are genuinely extra deaths at weekends, is there any evidence that junior doctors, who work more weekends than other staff, are the key. Nor, say health economists, is there any evidence that heavy investment in extra weekend staff delivers good value for money in lives saved, compared with other spending. But health is politics. Hunt wanted a fight, and he got one, but it has ended any leadership hopes he once had. No tears shed there. Far worse is the long-term effect this will have on the junior doctors themselves. Many more are likely to flee abroad or go into some other occupation after experiencing the grinding exhaustion and high anxiety of their job being met with such cynical political ingratitude and incomprehension. The shortage of doctors is acute, and some specialisms canâ€™t fill their rotas. Nurses too are in critically short supply. Why anyone would think this is a good time to end bursaries for trainee nurses is a mystery. The NHS itself is now registering its worst ever results since waiting times were recorded: for A&E, operations, cancer treatment and ambulance times. As the situation worsens, this strike, with its popular support, will have helped place the blame firmly where it belongs â€“ with a government that pretended to promise ringfenced funding, but which has given the NHS its lowest increase over the last six years than at any time since 1948 â€“ 0.8% against an average 4% rise to cover a growing and ageing population. The UK is tumbling down the international league table for health spending. Frankly, the wonder is how well it has managed, when many health economists predicted it wouldnâ€™t. But the pressure building up in lack of staff will blow the lid off, as overstretched managers try to keep the wheels turning while repairing the unfathomable organisational mayhem caused by the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. Even if they vote to accept the deal, even if they feel deflated, as all strikers do, the junior doctors will have scored an important victory in telling the public exactly whatâ€™s happening inside the NHS.',\n",

UKARâ€™s annual report discloses that Banks will receive a bonus of Â£211,750 through a scheme known as the Phoenix incentive plan, designed to reward staff for the sell-off of the mortgage processing operation. This bonus scheme means that about 1,900 staff are in line for as much as Â£1,500 each in the new financial year. Some 1,700 staff will be transferring to the new Computershare venture, while 200 staff will remain at UKAR to continue winding down the operation and oversee the governmentâ€™s help to buy mortgage incentive programme. Banks insisted no jobs would be lost. He will not receive a payoff for moving across to the new operation. Last year, UKAR caused controversy by selling Â£13bn of mortgages to the private equity firm Cerberus, in a deal that allowed a bonus scheme for executives to vest a year earlier than planned. It will pay out next year. In the budget, George Osborne had said that about another Â£16bn of B&B mortgages would be sold off and Banksâ€™s replacement as chief executive, the current finance director, Ian Hares, said this was expected to take place by 2018. UKARâ€™s aim is to reduce the size of its balance sheet â€“ which is now Â£72.5bn (63%) smaller than it was when the body was created in 2010 â€“ and repay the government loan used to keep it afloat. UKAR has repaid Â£20.4bn of the government loans, reducing its size by 42%. While profits were down 25% to Â£1bn, this was in line with expectations because of the reduction in the value of lending. UKAR is closed to new business but its longest mortgage runs to February 2049. Richard Pym is also stepping down as chairman to be replaced by the non-executive John Tattersall. Pym will waive any future fees. No details were given of Hareâ€™s pay for when he becomes chief executive, but he received Â£718,000 in 2015.',\n",
              "  'Why Brexit is not music to the ears of British bands touring Europe Europe is closing. â€œBrexit means Brexit,â€\\x9d reiterates PM Theresa May, buying time until the negotiations for this apparent â€œhard Brexitâ€\\x9d are hammered out. In this political purgatory, businesses are left floundering, unsure about what it will actually mean for them. For British bands touring on the continent, the uncertainty about one of their only certain means of income could not have come at a worse time. Itâ€™s not just bands, agents and tour managers voicing worries about the miasma of ambiguity. Sir John Sorrell, the founder of the Creative Industries Federation, has recently argued that touring acts could be driven off the road due to visa and carnet costs in a post-Brexit Europe. (Carnet is a system governing transportation of equipment across borders without having to complete customs declarations on every item, but they could run up to Â£2,000 a year.) These will all slash the margins of an artistâ€™s primary source of income. Sorrell said the creative sector is â€œa key driver of wealth and global successâ€\\x9d for the UK. â€œTo imperil that would be to imperil our wider economy.â€\\x9d Touring agents and managers that I have spoken to off the record in recent months all revealed enormous uncertainty about what will happen to British acts playing shows and festivals across Europe in the aftershock of Brexit. They are trying to put a brave face on things but most are fearing the worst â€“ namely the closure of opportunities and escalating running costs that could make touring utterly unsustainable. â€œI think the biggest thing for me as a production manager would be the addition of a carnet for every show outside the UK,â€\\x9d Joel Stanley, production manager at Production Value, told live industry trade magazine IQ in March. â€œCurrently we only ever have to show proof of ownership with the bond and have it stamped in and out if we go outside of the EU â€“ mainly Switzerland â€“ but [post-Brexit weâ€™d need a carnet] even for a one-off show in France.â€\\x9d Agents and touring artists are already dealing with the aftermath of the decline of the CD business. In the boom years, labels would underwrite shows with tour support and regard this as a marketing investment to break new acts that would then go on, ideally, to sell lots of records, thereby covering that development cost. That is now evaporating to the point where 20-date European tours are being truncated to 10 or eight-date jaunts around Europe, with days off a rare thing because days off mean no money is coming in. The net effect could be that acts will just focus on a handful of big European cities â€“ but if they all do that, the shrunken market will quickly become over-saturated and everyone will lose. Add in the possibility of requiring a work visa for every European country and costs could spiral before acts have even played their first show of a European tour. This is already making it hard in other major markets; the same system in Europe could be catastrophic. â€œGetting visas is an absolute minefield and it costs a lot of money, and itâ€™s the reason that a lot of people donâ€™t get to tour America,â€\\x9d Colin Roberts of Big Life Management told Pitchfork in June. â€œEven going to a country like Japan where visas are quite easy to get, I know how difficult it is having to factor in the cost and the time to acquire a visa.â€\\x9d The government loves to pay lip service to the export power of British music, braying and gloating from boxes at the Brit awards about how proud they are of our globally successful artists. Britain, since Beatlemania, has been the second biggest exporter of music globally after the US. There is a huge amount of money at stake here for both artists and the UK economy. A study by UK Music this summer found there were 10.4m â€œmusic touristsâ€\\x9d coming to the UK in 2015 and their direct and indirect spend was Â£3.7bn. These are people drawn to the UK because of the live market, its successful music exports and its diverse grassroots scenes. On top of this, the BPI reports that British acts accounted for one in seven albums sold globally in 2014, with their record sales generating approximately $2.75bn that year. So there are really two issues here: the outbound earnings of the acts on the road, and the inbound earnings that come from the UK being seen as a global force in music. There is an argument that just because the UK has successfully exported the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Coldplay, Adele and so on, it will just keep doing so forever. It wonâ€™t. It needs support and infrastructure at all levels (not just for superstars). Itâ€™s an industry truism that the old model of touring as a loss leader to sell albums has been inverted â€“ records are now loss leaders to promote tours. But if you garrotte the touring opportunities, then everyone down the pecking order suffers, and those at the very bottom suffer first and hardest. Couple this with the systematic closure of key grassroots venues around the UK â€“ something the Music Venue Trust was set up as a registered charity in 2014 to lobby against â€“ and things are starting to look very bleak indeed for the future of British live music.',\n",
              "  'Michelle Rodriguez gender transition thriller added to Toronto lineup A controversial thriller about a hitman forced to undergo gender reassignment surgery has been added to the lineup of next monthâ€™s Toronto international film festival. (Re) Assignment, formerly known as Tomboy, a Revengerâ€™s Tale, stars Michelle Rodriguez as a male assassin who undergoes a transition against his will at the hands of a rogue surgeon, played by Sigourney Weaver. The film, which is directed by The Warriorsâ€™ Walter Hill, was criticised last year by the LGBT group Glaad, which called the premise â€œsensationalisticâ€\\x9d and said the film undermined the progress of transgender rights. The film festivalâ€™s press release makes no mention of the transgender theme, describing the story as â€œa trail of self-discovery and redemption against a criminal mastermind opponentâ€\\x9d. (Re) Assignment joins a slew of other world premieres announced by festival organisers. Other high-profile titles include Burn Your Maps, a drama about an eight-year-old boy (played by Room star Jacob Tremblay) who persuades his family to take him on an epic journey after becoming convinced he is a Mongolian goat herder. Also appearing at the festival is Brain on Fire, director Gerard Barrettâ€™s film about a New York Post journalist (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) who experienced seizures, hallucinations and violent outbursts. Meanwhile, in The Exception offers mind games with higher stakes as rival agents wrestle over the fate of the abdicated German Kaiser (Christopher Plummer) in the middle of the second world war. It also stars Lily James, Jai Courtney and Janet McTeer, and is the feature-film debut of the theatre director David Leveaux. The Duelist, by Russian director Alexey Mizgirev, is about a St Petersburg gun-for-hire who takes on other peopleâ€™s fights, while Rage, directed by Sang-il Lee, is a grisly three-part thriller that hops between Japanese cities and stars Ken Watanabe. The Long Excuse, also set in Japan, is a comedy-drama about a man (Masahiro Motoki) who offers to care for the children of another man who is widowed by the same crash that killed his own wife. The Toronto film festival runs from 8-18 September.',\n",
              "  'Officer and a gentleman: how Sidney Poitier united a divided America Sidney Poitierâ€™s skill was that, more than almost any other actor of his time, he gave to audiences an essential reassurance; Poitierâ€™s problem was that in the era of the Black Panthers, reassurance looked like collusion. He was the Martin Luther King character, entirely dignified, in contrast to Malcolm X, whose very persona was a sharp rebuff to worried whites. It was the paradox of his career that Poitierâ€™s genius should be expressed in a culture that found consensus suspect. Yet the audience he won over was no homogeneous entity, but a crowd suffused with contention. What we see in Poitierâ€™s extraordinary run of movies, from The Defiant Ones (1958) to Guess Whoâ€™s Coming to Dinner (1967), is the record of a divided Americaâ€™s growing desire to unite around their affection for this shyest of stars. Race complicates this bashful love; Poitierâ€™s essential apartness as a person is what is being screened. At the inception of the permissive society, Poitier stood as the restrained, courteous and uncorrupted star, someone truly heroic. His reiterated attempt to express the dignity of an adult man is a social project, an assertion of the deepest possible civil right. Poitier was the first black male star to engage the American national consciousness at a time when the prevailing image of a film star was still that of someone white. In a 1967 interview, Poitier declared that when he first began appearing in films, â€œthe kind of Negro played on the screen was always negative, buffoons, clowns, shuffling butlers, really misfits. This was the background when I came along 20 years ago and I chose not to be a party to the stereotyping â€¦ I want people to feel when they leave the theatre that life and human beings are worthwhile. That is my only philosophy about the pictures I do â€¦ I have four children â€¦ They go to movies all the time but they rarely see themselves reflected there.â€\\x9d It would be hard to overstate the strength and depth of the prejudices that an actor such as Poitier had to overcome. When she received an Oscar for best supporting actress for Gone With the Wind in 1940, Hattie McDaniels was made to sit at a separate table from the white cast. Given these attitudes, itâ€™s extraordinary that, in a 1968 Motion Picture Herald poll, Poitier was named the No 1 money-making film star in the world. As the series of his films being screened as part of the BFIâ€™s Black Star season demonstrate, the time was right for Poitier. That time began with Stanley Kramerâ€™s The Defiant Ones (1958), which has Poitier on the run from the chain gang, while handcuffed to a racist fellow con, played by Tony Curtis. On screen, Poitier was often paired up, even bound together, with racist characters. In Pressure Point (1962), he is a prison psychiatrist obliged to treat a pathologically racist American Nazi (played by Bobby Darin). The Defiant Ones displays a strange fascination with the physical proximity of the two men, a closeness always threatening to turn to violence. Itâ€™s a staging of a baffled and beguiling closeness between black and white characters that will run through many of Poitierâ€™s greatest films. In A Raisin in the Sun (1961), Poitier is firmly at home with a mainly black cast, a thwarted son and husband blocked in his attempt to step out of the ghetto. Poitier here can define himself in relation to other African-American characters, a route to maturity he was rarely offered in his best films. Poitierâ€™s greatest role, and the one for which he won a Golden Globe and an Oscar, is Homer Smith in Ralph Nelsonâ€™s stirring Lilies of the Field (1963). Itâ€™s hard to think of a less fashionable film; no movie that ends with a hymn and a resounding â€œAmenâ€\\x9d is likely to be popular again. Poitier is a drifter who finds himself taken in by a group of German-speaking nuns eager to have him build them a chapel in the middle of the Arizona desert. Lilies of the Field creates a utopian space, remote as it can be from racist contempt, establishing a realm for hardâ€‘working migrants. The only person in the film to express racist views is a middle-aged white boss; itâ€™s a movie made to foster agreement. That last â€œAmenâ€\\x9d is apt in a parable about coming together, reaching accord. In Guy Greenâ€™s A Patch of Blue (1965), Poitier plays an office clerk who decides to help a young blind woman, someone who has been confined to her room by her manipulative mother (an Oscar-winning performance by Shelley Winters). Set in a racist southern city, itâ€™s a kind of fable about race relations. As Selina (Elizabeth Hartman) is blind, she only notices Poitierâ€™s kindness, humour and concern, and when she discovers he is black, she does not stop loving him. Her mother is a prostitute, and Selina ends up being pushed into prostitution herself. Itâ€™s a grimly sexualised world, and amid its voyeuristic complicities, only Poitier seems to stand above the ruthlessness of desire. In his 1950s and 60s movies, Poitier was not allowed to display much, if any, evidence of sexuality. At the time, some critics worried that his characterâ€™s apparent lack of sexual interest in Selina was a cop-out, a refusal to own up to adult facts. Certainly, there was an investment in imagining Poitier as chaste. The reassurance he offers is itself â€œsexyâ€\\x9d, I feel, though in part because it transcends the possibility of actual sex. That sexiness would be most at issue, perhaps, in his playing the charismatic school teacher in the British film directed by James Clavell To Sir, With Love (1967), where the circumstances insist on Poitierâ€™s wistful avoidance of his pupil Judy Geesonâ€™s schoolgirl crush. Here his self-imposed restraint makes sense, and undoubtedly if he flirted back or responded in kind, weâ€™d think less of him. The film makes explicit the ways in which Poitierâ€™s movies preoccupy themselves with the exploration of his on-screen appeal. Playing one of his young East End pupils, Lulu speculates: â€œYouâ€™re like us, but you ainâ€™t.â€\\x9d Poitier was always â€œlike usâ€\\x9d, while being in indefinable ways better: more courteous, more courageous. He places himself here on one side of the generation gap, standing in for an authority that youth might still respect. (A dozen years before, Poitier had himself played a classroom hooligan in Blackboard Jungle .) In his other two great films of 1967, In the Heat of the Night and Guess Whoâ€™s Coming to Dinner, Poitier is more firmly on the boundary between the two generations. In the first, he is at once an earnest policeman and an example of young African-American self-assertion; in the second, he is a mature doctor and a rebellious son. Itâ€™s clear from all three 1967 films how much Poitier became necessary as a way to figure a route out of the conflict in American life. He was on both sides at once, not as a dupe or an â€œUncle Tomâ€\\x9d, but as a genuinely responsible, realised man. Poitier recently won a BFI poll for the best ever performance by a black actor for his role as Virgil Tibbs in Norman Jewisonâ€™s In the Heat of the Night. Itâ€™s certainly one of his best films, though in terms of his acting, itâ€™s remarkable chiefly for how fiercely he puts himself in abeyance. His restraint is whatâ€™s on show, and it is more than ever a film about our distance and closeness to the star. Three times, our hero tenderly touches the white characters, crossing an indefinable borderline. We see it in the compassionate attentiveness with which he examines the murder victimâ€™s body; itâ€™s there in the careful grasp with which he caresses the first major suspect; itâ€™s present most tentatively in the restrained touch with which he endeavours to comfort the grieving widow. Itâ€™s a film about needing help, and the detective plot is a mere McGuffin around those touches and the sympathetic reaching out enacted between bullish, put-upon Rod Steiger and Poitier. The parody of these intimacies comes with the returned slap that Poitier gives to the racist plantation owner. That hard blow shows heâ€™s no cheek-turning Christian but a person asserting himself in the world. Watching Poitierâ€™s films, I lost count of the moments where white characters call him â€œboyâ€\\x9d. With that in mind, the simple statement, â€œThey call me Mr Tibbsâ€\\x9d, is a declaration of independence. If we want to place these touches in context, it is good to remember the scandal caused in March 1968, when Petula Clark touched Harry Belafonteâ€™s arm on television, or the furore around the first TV â€œinterracicalâ€\\x9d kiss that November, between Star Trekâ€™s Lieutenant Uhuru and Captain Kirk. Only in 1967 did the US supreme court unanimously rule that anti-miscegenation laws were unconstitutional. There was a taboo on tenderness: the feelings inspired by Poitier had to remain attenuated, distanced ones. Itâ€™s especially good to bear all this in mind when watching Stanley Kramerâ€™s Guess Whoâ€™s Coming to Dinner, a cotton-wool unreality of a movie. Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracyâ€™s bubbly innocent daughter is set to marry Poitier, a widowed older doctor; his parents, and hers, are unhappy about it. Itâ€™s not that they are racist, the film tells us, more that they worry about the problems and prejudices such a couple will face. In the end, naturally, love conquers all. The movieâ€™s real subject is again the generational divide, with Poitier a 37-year-old who is still primarily a son. He stands up for the younger generation, declaring to his father: â€œYou think of yourself as a coloured man, I think of myself as a man.â€\\x9d It was, in its way, Poitierâ€™s last great statement of belief, an assertion of his right to be a person on film. After the great year of 1967, he kept making movies, but nothing ever again matched the impact and power of the films he had made in the previous 10 years. He trod old ground, reprising the role of Tibbs, twice, and even doing the TV film To Sir, With Love II; he played Nelson Mandela alongside Michael Caine as FW de Klerk, and was as good as ever. Yet, US cinema could no longer find a significant place for him. Still, the impact of those movies and the ways they changed American life are being felt today. In these films, Poitier will always be a living example of a star and of a good man, an actor carrying movie stardom and even the idea of personhood itself forward through a period of profound change. â€¢ In the Heat of the Night is re-released nationally on 18 November.

              "  \"Department of Health adviser 'gagged' in Sky interview on junior doctors' strike Department of Health staff intervened to stop a Sky News journalist from asking one of its advisers why Jeremy Hunt was not giving interviews on the eve of the junior doctorsâ€™ strike. Following requests from journalists for Hunt to talk about the strike, the department put forward Professor Sir Norman Williams for a pool interview with Sky correspondent Darren McCaffrey to be distributed to news outlets on Monday evening. After asking where Hunt was, and being told by Williams that he was â€œat his deskâ€\\x9d at the Department of Health, McCaffrey asked whether â€œitâ€™s good that doctors on the eve of a strike and indeed the people that use the NHS arenâ€™t able to hear from the secretary of state?â€\\x9d Before Williams can answer, a Department of Health aide could be heard intervening to stop the line of questioning, saying: â€œHang on a second, weâ€™re not doing this nonsense likeâ€¦â€\\x9d He then says â€œwe agreed a series of questionsâ€\\x9d, prompting McCaffery to respond that he hadnâ€™t agreed to any line of questioning. The exchange was later broadcast on the BBCâ€™s Victoria Derbyshire show and then shared by junior doctors and others on Twitter. The Department of Health refused to comment on whether it was normal for aides to intervene to block reportersâ€™ questions, but pointed to Huntâ€™s subsequent media appearances on the day of the strike itself. McCaffrey wrote in a post on Skyâ€™s website on Tuesday afternoon: â€œIt was a reasonable enough question on the eve of the junior doctors strike ... although it appears the Department of Health didnâ€™t feel quite the same way.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Watford v Manchester City: Premier League â€“ as it happened Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! Itâ€™s all over! Manchester City end their poor run of form on the road by snatching victory from Watford with two goals in the final 10 minutes. For the second match in succession, Watford lose out to a late sucker punch, but their fans can take great heart from a fine performance in defeat. They remain in ninth place in the Premier League table, while City stay in third, three points behind leaders Arsenal. 90+4 min: Watford embark on one last attack, with Cathcart sending the ball long to Troy Deeney. He attempts to find Ighalo with a header, but Joe Hart clears up for City. 90+3 min: Aleksandar Kolarov is forced to intervene as Ighalo attempts to control a headed through ball from Troy Deeney. 90+2 min: Ighalo wins a throw-in deep in Manchester City territory and the ball makes itâ€™s way to Allan Nyom on the right flank. He stands the ball up for Ben Watson in the penalty area, but Joe Hart punches clear. 90 min: The fourth official suggests four minutes of added time. Can Watford rescue a point? They almost certainly deserve one, having played so well and lead until the 81st minute. 87 min: Ighalo spurns a wonderful chance to restore parity for Watford, swivelling to shoot straight at Joe Hart from seven or eight yards out after latching on to a through ball from Geudioura. 87 min: Watford substitution from a few minutes ago: Adlene Geudioura on for Jose Jurado. Manchester City substitution: Martin Demichelis on for Sergio Aguero. 85 min: That was a fine goal from Aguero. Running down the right touchline on the overlap, Bacary Sagna swung a cross into the edge of the six yard box. Bursting between Watfordâ€™s centre-backs, Aguero leapt to send a header into the bottom corner. Sergio Aguero puts Manchester City ahead with a fine header from the edge of the six-yard box. 83 min: That was a brilliant finish from Yaya Toure. As Aleksandar Kolarov shaped to take a corner, Toure jogged into position about 10 yards from goal in line with the near post. With his marker standing behind him, he made his unstoppable volley past Gomes look completely effortless. Donâ€™t be fooled - his technique was flawless. 81 min: Yaya Toure equalises with a splendid near post volley to convert an Aleksandar Kolarov corner. Thatâ€™s a wonderful finish. 79 min: Etienne Capoue advances into Manchester City territory, nutmegs Sergio Aguero on the edge of the penalty area and shoots high over the bar when he should have scored. 77 min: Allan Nyom kicks fresh air while attempting to clear a bouncing ball, allowing Kevin De Bruyne to drill a cross into the penalty area. They survive the scare and clear. 75 min: Bony is quickly into action, but not quite quickly enough. Despite his best attempts, heâ€™s unable to get to a low cross from Kevin De Bruyne before it rolls into the arms of a grateful Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal. 74 min: Almen Abdi drags a shot well wide from distance. Manchester City substitution: Wilfried Bony on, Eliaquim Mangala off after another torrid day at the office. 72 min: Yaya Toure has a pop from about 25 yards out, but drags his daisy-cutter well wide of the left upright, earning himself hoots and whistles of derision from various Watford fans. 71 min: Nothing comes of the corner as the game enters its final 20 minutes. 69 min: Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva exchange passes in a wonderful one-two just outside the Watford penalty area. From the edge of the D, DeBruyne unleashes a low, venomous drive that looks to be heading for the bottom lewft-hand corner until Heurelho Gomes dives to put it around the upright for a corner. 67 min: Kevin De Bruyne gallops down the left flank before pulling the ball back into the path of Yaya Toure in the penalty area. Itâ€™s a glorious scoring opportunity, but the big Ivorian sends the ball high over the cross-bar. 65 min: Jesus Navas gets in behind Holebas on the right flank and sends a looping cross into the Watford penalty area. Itâ€™s cleared. 64 min: City win a corner. With the ball arrowing towards Fernandinho on the edge of the six-yard box, Etienne Capoue does just enough to knock him off his stride and prevent an equaliser. Fernandinho goes to ground and appeals for a penalty, but none is forthcoming. 63 min: More pressure from Watford, with left-back Jose Holebas jinking his way past two City defenders, before unleashing a shot that takes a deflection off one of his team-mates and going wide for a goal-kick. 62 min: From the right flank, Allan Nyom sends a cross into the City penalty area, but Otamendi heads clear. 60 min: With half an hour to go, City are struggling away from home once again. Watford are showing no signs that they intend to sit back and try to protect their leaqd and continue to take the game to their visitors. 59 min: Watford win a free-kick in the centre-circle for a push in the back by Aguero. Manuel Pellegrini makes his first change, removing Raheem Sterling and replacing him with Jesus Navas. 56 min: Originally, there was a suggestion that Watson had scored directly from the corner, but replays show that Kolarov helped the ball on its way with a glancing header. Without Kolarovâ€™s intervention, Joe Hart would almost certainly have punched clear, so Kolarov will be credited with the goal. But in a world where so few players are capable of taking corners properly, Watson can be very pleased with his assist. Watford win a corner, which Ben Watson curls in towards the near post. His inswinger is sublime and Aleksandar Kolarov can only head it into his own net as he attempts to defend it. Watford lead 1-0. 53 min: A chance for City! From the corner, Fernandinho gets a free header, but sends his effort over the bar. 52 min: Sterling plays the ball wide to Kevin De Bruyne on the left flank and he cuts inside and takes a shot, which is deflected out for a corner. In the penalty area, Silva has a go at De Bruyne for not playing the ball into his path. 52 min: Sterling tries to prod the ball in behind the Watford defence for Sergio Aguero to chase, but his attempted pass is blocked. Agueroâ€™s seen very little of the ball this evening, which seems surprising considering the talent of his support network. 49 min: Good defending from Sagna, who hooks the ball clear as it bounces across the edge of the six yard box. He needed to be decisive, as Troy Deeney was lurking with menacing intent behind the full-back, waiting to pounce on any scraps that came his way. 48 min: From the corner, Hart punches clear, Watford enjoy a period of sustained pressure until Fernandinho sticks a boot in and tries to send Sergio Aguero on his way with a long ball up the field. Thereâ€™s too much welly on his through ball, which Aguero is unable to latch on to despite staying onside. Gomes mops up at the back for Watford. 47 min: From a throw-in, the ball finds itâ€™s way to Ben Watson on the edge of the Manchester City penalty area. His low drive was heading wide, but not by so far that Joe Hart didnâ€™t feel compelled to dive and turn it around the post for a corner. 46 min: Abdi sends the ball wide to Allan Nyom, who plays it back inside to Ben Watson. Britos, Holebas and Capoue all get early second half touches as the home side spray the ball around the field in search of an opening. Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney get the second half party started, with no changes in personnel instigated by either manager at the break. Itâ€™s all square at half-time in a match Watford dominated in the opening stages. Manchester City played their way back into the game and dominated for 20 minutes or so, but Watford probably had the better of the closing 10 minutes of the half. Both sides have had their chances - although Watfordâ€™s were more clear cut - and level-pegging seems fair enough at the interval. Hereâ€™s hoping for more of the same in the second half. 44 min: The fourth official suggests one additional minute of added time. 42 min: Fernandinho is penalised for a foul on Etienne Capoue, giving Watford a free-kick about 50 yards from the City goal. Ben Watson aims for the head of Miguel Britos as the centre-half darts into the penalty area. He wins the ball, but not cleanly and Manchester City are able to clear their lines. 39 min: Watford win a free-kick some distance out from the City goal, which Ben Watson sends into the penalty area. The ballâ€™s cleared, but only as far as Jose Jurado on the angle of the penalty area, left-hand side. With Deeney, Ighalo and others calling for a cross, he attempts to curl the ball into the top right-hand corner. His effort sails wide of the angle of crossbar and upright. 38 min: Allan Nyom tries to make his way into the Manchester City penalty area, only to find his path blocked by Fernandinho. The Manchester City midfielder shapes to tackle the right-back, only to pull out of the challenge. Unperturbed, Nyom goes to ground anyway, flinging himself theatrically in a manner that earns him a yellow card. He can have no grumbles about that one. 37 min: Watford attack on the break, with Abdi galloping down the right flank. Fernandinho does well to get back and dispossess the winger with a good tackle. Watford were breaking in numbers and his intervention was crucial. 36 min: Having been dominated for 10 or so, Watford enjoy some moments of respite as they get the ball out of their own half for the first time in what seems like an age. 33 min: Having picked up a pass from deep from Toure, Sergio Aguero is unable to make room for a shot himself, but picks out Kevin De Bruyne in space in the penalty area. His effort is blocked and rebounds into the path of David Silva on the edge of the penalty area. The Spaniard shoots, but De Bruyne is unable to get out of his way and unintentionally deflects the ball away from the target. It goes out for a corner, from which nothing comes. 31 min: Now itâ€™s Kolarovâ€™s turn to have a potshot. His effort fizzes over the bar. 30 min: As Manchester City begin to dominate, Sergio Aguero shoots wide from a promising position. 29 min: David Silva links up well with Fernandinho as they charge down the inside right channel. A promising move comes to naught when Raheem Sterling blasts over the bar following Watfordâ€™s failure to clear an attempted David Silva bicycle kick properly. Moments before Silvaâ€™s acrobatic effort, Fernandinho had a shot saved by Gomes. 28 min: Raheem Sterling picks up the ball on the left flank, makes his way past Allan Nyom, only to run a blind alley with Craig Cathcart waiting in the shadows. The Watford centre-half robs the winger of possession and clears. 26 min: With Toure back on his feet, play resumes. David Silva wriggles his way down the inside right and into the Watford penalty area, but is unable to get a cross in to Sergio Aguero, whoâ€™s cutting a rather forlorn figure. 24 min: Yaya Toure goes down holding his left shin after a bruising challenge from behind by Almen Abdi. The Watford midfielder seems lucky to have avoided a booking there. 22 min: Itâ€™s worth noting that the previous corner was conceded by Eliaquim Mangala, whoâ€™s being given the absolute run-around by Odion Ighalo. Mangala looks a bag of nerves and looks good for at least one bit of slapstick defending that could result in a Watford goal. 21 min: Watford win a corner, which Ben Watson sends into the mixer. The ball drops out of the night sky, bounces off Craig Cathcartâ€™s thigh and into the hands of Joe Hart. Cathcart didnâ€™t seem to be expecting that - had he been more alert, he could have converted a fairly easy chance from no more than seven or eight yards out. 19 min: Kevin De Bruyne tries his luck from distance, with a clever shot that pitches up just in front of Heurelho Gomes, but the Brazilian goalkeeper isnâ€™t unduly troubled by the audacious effort. 17 min: Watford win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Manchester City goal. Ben Watson and Jose Holebas stand over it as Joe Hart instructs his defensive wall. Watson, who headed Wiganâ€™s winner against City in the FA Cup final three years ago, takes the free-kick, but his effort is poor. The ball sails high and wide of Joe Hartâ€™s goal. On Sky Sports, co-comms man Alan Smith suggests he should have taken advantage of the wet conditions and greasy surface to shoot low and hard in a bid to test Joe Hart. 13 min: With his back to goal on the edge of the City penalty area, Ighalo demonstrates a wonderful first touch to turn Otamendi and leave himself with only Joe Hart to beat. The City goalkeeper rushes off his line to smother the ball, which breaks in the penalty area. Cityâ€™s desperate defenders manage to prevent any Watford players from converting the rebound. This is a cracking game - long may it continue. 11 min: With Troy Deeney through on goal after an idiotic pass from Otamendi, Aleksandar Kolarov performs heroics to get back and muscle him off the ball. Deeney goes down in a heap and thereâ€™s a huge shout from the stands for a penalty, but Martin Atkinson doesnâ€™t give one. Replays suggest itâ€™s the correct decision. 9 min: With Eliaquim Mangala caught out of position, Nicolas Otamendi does well to get back and cover as Odion Ighalko attempts to latch on to a long ball through the centre. His excellent covering tackle results in a corner for Watford, but nothing comes of it. 9 min: Etienne Capoue miscontrols a pass in midfield and cedes possession to Yaya Toure, who advances. The ball finds its way to Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal. 8 min: Raheem Sterling gets on the ball on the left touchline, cuts inside and links up with David Silva on the edge of the Watford penalty area. The hosts clear. 7 min: Capoue attempts to play the ball into the penalty area towards Ighalop and Deeney, but his intentions are well read by Kolarov, who heads clear. Itâ€™s been a lively, entertaining start from two teams who look fairly evenly matched at this early stage. 5 min: More good play from Watford out on the right flank, with Etieene Capoue and Abdi combining well. Making his way into the penalty area, the former goes down under a challenge from Mangala and appeals for a free-kick, but doesnâ€™t get one. 4 min: With plenty of Manchester City players in the Watford penalty area, Aleksandar Kolarov blows a decent opportunity to deliver a good ball from, the left. 2 min: Almen Abdi takes the first shot in anger and itâ€™s not too far away! After good build-up play in which Jose Jurado ghosted past Yaya Toure, the ball found its way to Abdi on the edge of the area. He unleashed a surface to air screamer that fizzed narrowly wide of the top right-hand corner. 2 min: Manchester City dominate possession in the opening exchanges, although Mangala is forced to put the ball out of play halfway inside his own half to concede a throw-in. 1 min: Manchester City get the ball rolling at Vicarage Road at referee Martin Atkinsonâ€™s signal. Itâ€™s wet and windy in Watford tonight. Not long now: The teams make their way out of the tunnel and line up for the pre-match niceties. Watfordâ€™s players wear their customary home kit of yellow shirts with thin black stripes down the front, black shorts and black socks. Manchester Cityâ€™s wear their usual light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks. Theyâ€™ll be kicking off in a moment or two. Itâ€™s difficult to imagine tonightâ€™s match concluding without a few goals, considering that Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo have scored 20 between them already this season in the top flight, while Manchester Cityâ€™s front four of David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero are a fairly terrifying proposition for any defence preparing to face them. More than three goals is the shout for me, which means a dull scoreless draw is almost certainly inevitable. Their players are warming up wearing T-shirts designed by Callum Ballantine, a 19-year-old from Didsbury who recently died from a rare form of bone cancer and will auction them for charity after the game. Along with his friend Samir Kamani, Callum designed a â€œMade from Manchesterâ€\\x9d range of clothing to help raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Callum and Samir raised over Â£20,000 for the charity before the formerâ€™s sad death on December 20th. Hats off to the lad, may he rest in peace. Having just beaten Newcastle at the Emirates, Arsenal have extended their lead at the top of the table to two points, as Leicester could only draw at home to Bournemouth. A win for Manchester City this evening will keep them in third place, three points behind Arsenal and two behind Leicester. A win for ninth-placed Watford will see them overtake Liverpool and Crystal Palace by moving into seventh place. Watford: Gomes, Nyom, Cathcart, Britos, Holebas, Abdi, Capoue, Watson, Jurado, Ighalo, Deeney. Subs: Prodl, Behrami, Oulare, Guedioura, Berghuis, Anya, Arlauskis. Man City: Hart, Sagna, Otamendi, Mangala, Kolarov, Fernandinho, Toure, De Bruyne, Silva, Sterling, Aguero. Subs: Zabaleta, Fernando, Caballero, Bony, Jesus Navas, Clichy, Demichelis. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) Manchester City get another opportunity to arrest their puzzling slump in away form with a trip to Vicarage Road, where theyâ€™ll face a Watford side whoâ€™d won four and drawn one before Mondayâ€™s reverse at the hands of Spurs. City have failed to win any of their last six on the road, losing against Tottenham, Stoke and Arsenal in the process. If they are to beat Watford today, they will have to do so without Vincent Kompany, who is suffering from a calf injury. In better news for Manuel Pellegrini, Fernando, Fabian Delph and Gael Clichy are all available for selection after spells in the treatment room. For Watford, Nathan Ake will sit this one out on the naughty step after being show a straight red card for a high challenge on Erik Lamela shortly after the hour against Tottenham. Defenders Tommie Hoban and Joel Ekstrand also remain absent through injury.',\n",
              "  'Promised Â£8bn extra for NHS is not enough, says hospitals boss Theresa May will have to rip up the governmentâ€™s financial plans for the NHS and commit more than the promised Â£8bn extra by 2020, a hospitals boss has said. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said ministers must come up with a new plan to fix the health serviceâ€™s crumbling finances or risk it becoming unable to function properly. In a submission to the Treasury before next weekâ€™s autumn statement, NHS Providers, which represents 96% of NHS trusts in England, says a rethink is necessary because the calculations underlying the governmentâ€™s Â£8bn pledge are flawed. It says demand for care is rising faster than envisaged in the blueprint drawn up by NHS bosses in 2014, the Five-Year Forward View, and social care has deteriorated. Hopson said: â€œSome of the key assumptions in the Five-Year Forward View, on which the current financial and NHS delivery plans for this parliament are based, have turned out to be wrong. There is now a clear and widening gap between what is being asked of the NHS and the funding available to deliver it. â€œThe NHS simply cannot do all that it is currently doing and is being asked to do in future on these funding levels.â€\\x9d Andrew Lansley, the health secretary from 2010 to 2012 in the coalition government, recently said the NHS needed a â€œBrexit bonusâ€\\x9d of Â£5bn on top of the Â£8bn already pledged, given the widespread public demand for higher NHS funding revealed by the EU referendum. NHS Providers does not specify how much more it wants invested. But Hopson said more than Â£8bn was justified because â€œdemand for care is a lot higher, social care is in a much worse state, general practice is turning out to be more unstable, and the starting point for the deficit among hospital, mental health, community and ambulance trusts has turned out to be much larger.â€\\x9d He said the overall health budget would go up by only Â£4.5bn by 2020, not the Â£8bn ministers pledged last year, because money was being taken from key areas such as public health in order to give the NHS its promised increase. Independent experts agree Â£4.5bn is the true increase that healthcare will get. The NHSâ€™s inability to deliver the Â£22bn of savings it had promised to make by 2020 â€“ a target that had always been â€œtoo ambitiousâ€\\x9d â€“ further underlined the need for more money to be found before the end of this parliament, said Hopson. May has been under pressure recently over her repeated claims that the government is giving the NHS Â£10bn more, and more than the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, asked for in 2014. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the Commons health select committee, and other members of the committee wrote to the chancellor Philip Hammond to say the claims were untrue. Labour has asked the UK Statistics Authority to rule on whether the Â£10bn claim is justified. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has subtly distanced himself from the Â£10bn figure and said the NHS will need a lot more money after 2020, at the end of its unprecedented decade-long budget squeeze. Ministers have already told Stevens that the NHS will not receive a funding boost in the autumn statement. But NHS and local council leaders hope the chancellor may find some extra money to prop up the ailing social care system. â€œNHS funding increases from next year onwards are not enough to maintain standards of care, meet rising demand from patients and deliver essential changes to services,â€\\x9d said Richard Murray, director of policy at the Kingâ€™s Fund thinktank. â€œIf additional [NHS] funding is not forthcoming later in the parliament, the government will need to be honest with the public about the impact on quality of care and access to services.â€\\x9d The Department of Health did not respond directly to Hopsonâ€™s comments. A spokesman said: â€œThis government has taken tough economic decisions that have allowed us to invest in our NHS, which is meeting record patient demand whilst improving standards of care. We have prioritised funding for the NHS with Â£4bn extra this year.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"'You want to know what they're writing, even if it hurts': my online abuse Lindsy Van Gelder, journalist, San Diego, 1985 When I bought a computer, in the 1980s, it was a different world. I joined Compuserve, the first major commercial online service in the US, in 1982. It was like Facebook, but all text. Now we would complain it was slow and expensive, but at the time it was radical to be able to sit in your house and talk to people all over the world. The online world seemed like a utopia; you had no idea of the race or gender of the person you were talking to, yet it was intimate. Compuserve was quite intellectual, but we had silly chats. It was mostly men using it. If you got on with someone you could go into a little corner of the site to text privately. Thatâ€™s where the â€œcompusexâ€\\x9d, the sexting of its time, happened. I never did it myself, because my partner at the time was not keen. Joan was a kind of celebrity on Compuserve; a brilliant neuroscientist in her late 20s who was disabled and disfigured after a terrible car accident. She could no longer talk, but she could type, and she was surrounded by admirers. She formed close friendships with many female users, although she often tried to talk them into having Compusex. For one woman in particular, Janis, Joan was a real support. Janis had ongoing health problems and was mourning the death of her brother. The two became very close. A year later Joan enthusiastically introduced Janis to another Compuserve user called Alex. Janis and Alex, an able-bodied, male, New York psychiatrist in his 50s, met up offline and started a relationship. Meanwhile Joan wrote about her own whirlwind romance, meeting and marrying a police officer. But other Compuserve users became suspicious of Joanâ€™s dazzling romance and success. Months later Joan was confronted by one distrustful user and admitted she was not just friends with Alex â€“ she was Alex. Traumatised and angry, Janis said at the time she â€œwanted to jump off a bridgeâ€\\x9d. To me that was everyoneâ€™s nightmare of betrayal by a lover. When I contacted him as a journalist, Alex refused to return my call. He continued to be a prominent psychiatrist who won major honours for his work, until his death a few years ago. I wrote about the story for Ms magazine, in a piece called The Strange Case of the Electronic Lover. Although I knew his real identity, Ms wouldnâ€™t publish it because they were in a financially precarious position and a lawsuit â€“ even if they won â€“ would have finished them. Alex claimed he wanted to try communicating as a woman. Some people on Compuserve felt sorry for him. Me? I think he was despicable. It certainly taught us the online world was not all rainbows and unicorns â€“ that creepy people could take advantage of the most entrancing things about the medium. Now everyone knows what the online and offline worlds are. Itâ€™s not a rarefied, weird corner of life. Itâ€™s certainly not an escape anymore. Ellen Spertus, professor of computer science, California, 1996 I first used the computer network Usenet as an undergraduate in the late 1980s. There was no commercialism â€“ no spam, if you can imagine that â€“ and it was mostly used by students or people who worked in technology. It seemed like a pretty safe place. I used my own name, and so did many other people. There were discussion groups divided into sections. Some were high minded, about science or maths, but others were more lowbrow. There was a kerfuffle around a group called rec.humour.funny, for instance, because the moderator accepted racist and sexist jokes. People argued that there shouldnâ€™t be censorship online. Back then we all thought that the online world would be more egalitarian because we werenâ€™t judging people on race or sex. Instead there has been a dehumanising effect because we donâ€™t see people face to face. In 1996, a man called Robert Toups started a site called Babes on the Web, displaying the names and photographs of women who had home pages (which had just begun), along with ratings based on the attractiveness of their photographs. When they asked him to remove them, he refused. He claimed he was being satirical. I was one of the women listed. I canâ€™t say I was shocked, but it was unexpected and unpleasant. It was part of the beginning of the fall â€“ the realisation this was not a safe place, that it was not true that the online world would be sexism-free. Some women responded by changing their image to that of a â€œbeefcakeâ€\\x9d picture. Someone else created a site to get people to rate Toups. I was a graduate student and wrote a paper called Social and Technical Means for Fighting On-Line Harassment, including this as one of the first major incidents of sexism that occurred on the web. I wanted to try to improve the situation for others. I thought social pressure would solve issues like this; because Toups would be lowering his reputation in front of women who would go on to be in positions of power. To some extent itâ€™s true â€“ I went on to become a professor and an engineer at Google. But my prediction that social pressures would solve the problem was wrong. Today I would say the situation for women online is just horrific. I advise my female students to use a pseudonym if they are writing about something like Gamergate. If you write about sexism or racism, people who have a powerful social media following can harass you. Take the case of Adria Richards; she tweeted about two men making sexist jokes at a tech conference, and one of them was fired. She received death threats and rape threats for speaking up. She had to leave her home because it was so terrible. I have offered a place to stay to women who canâ€™t stay in their homes because of threats they receive. I am glad I am no longer on the frontline. Jill Filipovic, lawyer and writer, 2006 Towards the end of my first semester of law school, a classmate mentioned a website where my name came up a lot. When another acquaintance mentioned the same thing I Googled around and found a message board for law school students called AutoAdmit. I read a couple of the threads, and they just seemed a little weird and creepy. If something came up about my law school, they would mention me. For instance, when someone wrote â€œSomeone barfed in the law school libraryâ€\\x9d the first comment would be â€œWas it JillF?â€\\x9d I donâ€™t know why they started on me, but I think it was because I was a feminist blogger, who wrote for Feministe. I was used to nasty comments from the blog, but then I found a post called â€œThe official Jill Filipovic rape threadâ€\\x9d. Elsewhere there were long discussions about whether posters would like to â€œhate-fuckâ€\\x9d me. One post read â€œI want to brutally rape that Jill slut.â€\\x9d Another: â€œIâ€™m 98% sure that she should be raped.â€\\x9d There were a bunch of photos of me, my Facebook profile had been copied and pasted, my email address was on there. The psychological turning point was reading comments like, â€œI saw her in class today and she said thisâ€¦ â€\\x9d Suddenly I realised those same people writing rape fantasies about me could be sitting next to me in contract law class. It wasnâ€™t just a nasty comment on the internet anymore. It felt very intimidating. I corresponded privately with the people who ran the website, but they wouldnâ€™t do anything about the posts. The university was very sympathetic, but said there wasnâ€™t anything they could do. I stopped going to class for some time. When I did go, I would wear a hooded sweatshirt or hide my face. I felt very suspicious and isolated. My friends didnâ€™t understand blogs or message boards so it was hard to explain it to them. In the end I went to therapy, which really helped. There were two episodes when it crossed over into my real life. Once a man sent me an email saying he had been to New York University and spoken to my professors about what a â€œdumb cuntâ€\\x9d I was. The second was when I was studying in the law school office with a friend. A man came to the door and asked me if I was Jill, then started screaming at me. Finally two other women who had been posted about on AutoAdmit sued the men who ran it. One of the men was a law student, and when the case made the papers his law firm rescinded their offer of a contract. The forum had a lot of users, many who said they were practising lawyers, and the legal industry is small. I felt like my identity was being filtered through this one site. I worked in a law firm for four years, but at networking events whenever someone stared at my name tag I worried they recognised me from those threads. Had they seen the pictures of me in a bikini that were posted? It had a huge impact on me. I spent years in fight or flight mode. Now I am very quick to be defensive online. I think having people who can support you (bloggers, or friends) is key. If I write something controversial, I give a friend my Twitter login so they can block abusive messages before I see them. Iâ€™m glad that harassment against women online is talked about properly now. I am so hardened to it, I donâ€™t get upset about much anymore. Natalie Farzaneh, 19, retail assistant, London, 2009 I was bullied at school, but being bullied online was even worse. Growing up I lived in a very white, middle class village outside York. My father is Iranian and that was always an issue. I was also bigger than the other children â€“ taller and overweight too. At school I was called Paki, Terrorist or Taliban and the children would make fun of my weight and my thick, curly hair. I was pushed down the stairs, and kids would throw chewing gum in my hair. Because I was lonely, I joined Facebook. I got lots of friend requests. I didnâ€™t realise they were just being sarcastic, taking screenshots of my page and laughing about it with their friends. Sometimes people would do weird Photoshopped pictures of my head on a pigâ€™s body. One of the worst points was when someone wrote on the schoolâ€™s Facebook page â€œThat awkward moment when you realise you are Natalie Farzanehâ€\\x9d. I felt like I was being attacked from all sides. As a lonely teenager you will try anything and go anywhere to make friends so I tried another site, Ask.fm. On it people can ask you questions anonymously â€“ I thought it would help show people I was a nice person. Instead I got horrible messages, saying â€œWhy are you so ugly?â€\\x9d Or â€œWhy are you so fat?â€\\x9d I didnâ€™t really tell my parents how bad things were. My mother and teachers knew I was picked on at school, and I had a youth worker who was great. But online things got worse. People would post things like, â€œKill yourself tonight or someone will do it tomorrowâ€\\x9d or â€œWatch your backâ€\\x9d or â€œI hope your parents get cancerâ€\\x9d. Because they were anonymous it made me paranoid. I would be sitting in a class full of people, worrying who was sending them. I started self harming and felt suicidal. People who havenâ€™t been bullied online will say â€œWhy didnâ€™t you just turn off your computer?â€\\x9d But they donâ€™t understand. You want to know what people are writing, even if it hurts. One day reading my Ask.fm inbox I felt like I couldnâ€™t breathe. My heart was racing. I went to my mum and said â€œI think I am dying.â€\\x9d She took me to the hospital, and said it was just a panic attack. Later I was diagnosed with anxiety â€“ I was about 12. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome. What helped was finding an online bullying charity when I was 14. I applied to be one of their ambassadors and I started doing media interviews. Although my parents were heartbroken when they heard how bad things had got, telling other people that help was available made me feel stronger. Other victims would say I made them feel less alone and had stopped them doing something stupid. I felt like I was turning a negative into a positive. When the kids in school saw me on TV and in newspapers some of them also started realising the effect theyâ€™d had. Some would say â€œI hope you realise it was just banter.â€\\x9d Some of my teachers also said they hadnâ€™t known how hard it had been. Today I am very happy, living in London with my boyfriend, and being a body positive blogger. I might get the odd nasty comment online but now I am older I donâ€™t obsess over hateful things. I still work as an anti-bullying ambassador and wish people would take online bullying more seriously. Bruises and cuts heal but you donâ€™t forget the names people call you. Darsh Singh, portfolio manager at an alternative investment company, Texas, 2015 I first realised I had become a viral meme in 2011. As a student I was the first American Sikh to play for the National Collegiate Athletic Association in a turban. I was captain of the team in my final year, and my jersey was put on display in the Smithsonian. Because of this, there was a picture of me playing online, and someone thought it would be funny to put Islamophobic captions on it. There were different versions but one read: â€œNobody wants to guard Muhammed, heâ€™s too explosiveâ€\\x9d. To be honest I just thought, â€œHere is another way people are expressing their hatred.â€\\x9d When you play sports at collegiate level, you get used to people yelling nasty things. Itâ€™s the usual names, which of course shouldnâ€™t be â€œusualâ€\\x9d; things like â€œtowelheadâ€\\x9d, â€œfucking terroristâ€\\x9d and lots of references to Osama bin Laden. So when I saw the meme on the web I thought, â€œThis is not a personal attack, itâ€™s a stupid picture and an expression of ignorance.â€\\x9d I just wrote something like, â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter what you say, haha.â€\\x9d My wife replied on Twitter saying something like, â€œThatâ€™s my husband and heâ€™s a nice person,â€\\x9d which helped. If you put people in context â€“ someoneâ€™s husband or son â€“ the conversation changes. Without it you are just a concept, and people are more comfortable yelling at a concept. The meme popped up again from time to time over the next few years, but I just ignored it. The internet is the worst place to argue with people â€“ itâ€™s a wasteland in terms of logic and thoughtfulness. Would it have helped if I pointed out I was Sikh, not Muslim? Maybe, but saying, â€œIâ€™m the wrong brown guy â€“ go catch those other ones!â€\\x9d is not in line with my beliefs. Sikhs stand in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters. Last year the meme flared up again, and one of my friendâ€™s brothers, Greg Worthington, wrote a long message on Facebook. He explained who I was and why my jersey was in the Smithsonian. The post was really, really kind. It got a huge reaction. Then the Smithsonian group created a new meme to share with Gregâ€™s post, and a hashtag #BelikeDarsh, which went viral. I was shocked. It showed me the power of online advocacy. I was interviewed by media outlets and TV stations and got so many messages and calls from sympathetic people. I found it very weird, but I realised that I had this megaphone so I should try and re-direct the love and attention. I wrote a post asking people to take care of others, in line with Sikhismâ€™s golden traditions; offer love to the people around you, be a voice for those who need it the most. Becoming the subject of a racist meme can be incredibly toxic. It is challenging to be in a world where people are anonymous and donâ€™t show compassion. You need a level of support in real life that many people donâ€™t have. Cyberbullying: a brief and partial history 1973 The Community Memory digital service in Berkeley, California, charges 25 cents per post to reduce abuse. 1998 In the first successful US prosecution of a hate crime on the internet, a former California university student is convicted for emailing death threats to Asian students. 2003 Film of Canadian schoolboy Ghyslain Raza with a â€˜light sabreâ€™ is uploaded and the â€˜Star Wars kidâ€™ goes viral. Raza becomes a victim of a cyberbullying attack, and later speaks publicly about its impact. 2005 A student on the Seoul subway refuses to clean up after her dog and is vilified as â€˜dog poo girlâ€™ after a photo goes viral. 2008 First US cyber-bullying trial in US, the United States vs Lori Drew, follows death of 13-year-old Megan Meier. Drew, the mother of Meierâ€™s friend (who posed as Josh Evans online), is acquitted but the case leads to the introduction of a Missouri state law. Unofficially known as Meganâ€™s law, this takes a tougher stance on cyberbullying. 2009 A teenager becomes the first British person to be jailed for bullying on social media. 2010 Paul Chambers is convicted (overturned on appeal) for tweeting a joke about blowing up an airport in the UK. 2011 A man is jailed in Manchester for harassing his ex-girlfriend online via a series of blogposts â€˜warningâ€™ men about her. 2012 Lord McAlpine is defamed in tweets by Sally Bercow, who later agrees to pay undisclosed damages. 2013 Caroline Criado-Perez receives death threats after winning her battle to reinstate a woman on English banknotes.

              "  \"Live Q&A: What's the best way to tackle Zika? For the expectant mothers of Recife, in Pernambuco state Brazil, the city at the heart of the Zika virus epidemic, trips to the hospital to check on their unborn children have become an ordeal. A third of Brazilâ€™s 3,893 Zika virus cases recorded by January 2020 have been found in Pernambuco. The mosquito-born disease causes fever, joint pain and rashes, as well as microcephaly, a condition which affects brain development and head size of babies. Recife resident Gleyse Kelly told the last month that she had discovered that her unborn daughter had an abnormally small head when she was seven months pregnant. â€œIt was devastating,â€\\x9d she said. â€œBut we had no time to react.â€\\x9d Her daughter Maria was born the next day. The Zika virus was declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation on 1 February. Across Latin America, governments have reacted to the virus with dramatic measures. In El Salvador, a country with restrictive laws on abortion, the government told its citizens to avoid getting pregnant until 2018. Now as the virus spreads to the US and Europe, a sense of urgency has grown in the international community. Pharmaceutical companies are reportedly working to develop a vaccine. Elsewhere, scientists have been searching for an answer to why the virus was able to spread so far, so quickly; with some pointing to the impact of climate change. In 2014, only 150 cases were recorded in the whole of Brazil. How do we overcome this disease? Would it help to swamp Zika-infected areas with pesticides, or would that make things worse? Should we simply look to eradicate mosquitos altogether? Join a panel of experts on Thursday 18 February from 1pm GMT to discuss these questions and more.

              "  'FCA not fit for purpose as Pure Gym float favours institutional investors Hereâ€™s an interesting business on its way to the stock market to raise Â£190m. Pure Gym is chaired by Tony Ball, who as chief executive of BSkyB in its early years helped to change television viewing habits in the UK. The gym chain is another tale of â€œdisruptionâ€\\x9d, promises Ball, which might encourage some of the 785,000 members to think of backing the IPO, or flotation, with a few quid. Forget it, unless you are a gym-goer who is also a fund manager. Yes, this IPO is another dreary institutions-only offering, which is par for the course when, as here, the seller comes from the land of private equity. Ordinary investorsâ€™ first chance to buy arrives only when the shares start trading. Worse, the whole IPO process could almost be designed to discourage general interest. If you wish to chew over Pure Gymâ€™s financial numbers at leisure, for example, youâ€™re a second-class citizen. The institutional crew will get their â€œpathfinderâ€\\x9d prospectus, which includes all the important data, well in advance. Outsidersâ€™ first sight will come when the full version is published a couple of days before the float actually happens. In the meantime, ordinary mortals must make do with edited highlights. There were interesting lines in Wednesdayâ€™s intention-to-float document, like the fact that Pure Gym claims a 47% return on capital at its â€œmatureâ€\\x9d gyms. But you will search in vain for up-to-date figures for pre-tax profit or even debt. Nobody could sensibly make an investment decision without those numbers. The real culprit is the Financial Conduct Authority and its predecessor, which over two decades has allowed retail punters to be squeezed out of the IPO game. Back in April, the regulator discussed some sensible reforms. Prospectuses could be published a fortnight before trading day, suggested the FCA, and independent analysts should not be gagged by lack of access to management. Five months later there is no sign of the FCA leaping into action. Those politicians who say from time to time that they want to promote a â€œshareholding democracyâ€\\x9d should start by telling the FCA to pull its finger out. Banks wonâ€™t be hurried over Brexit decisions The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, trying to hurry things along and get the Brexit show on the road, clearly hasnâ€™t met many British bankers. Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, and Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, head of the European end of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, are not chaps who like to be rushed. Solemnly, and in turns, they told the House of Lords on Wednesday that upending the European financial services industry canâ€™t be done lightly, quickly, or at all without risking serious instability. The cheerful interpretation, from the point of view of the City, is that a lot of jobs look safer than when some banks were threatening an exodus if the UK voted for Brexit. Big banks are so inflexible, it seems, that change throws them into confusion. That is easy to believe. The big four lenders were given half a decade to erect a ringfence around their retail operations in the UK and still they grumble about the pace of regulatory upheaval. Or, as Flint himself put it, itâ€™s taken HSBC three years to move 1,000 jobs from London to Birmingham, so switching to Paris would be a â€œnon-trivialâ€\\x9d undertaking. But Flint and Wilmot-Sitwell were not speaking out of patriotism. They were making the serious â€“ and surely correct â€“ point that both the UK and the EU would suffer if the European financial system is rejigged overnight. Frankfurt and Paris simply arenâ€™t in a position to perform Londonâ€™s pan-European role. If the financial services industry is forced to jump through too many new licensing hoops too quickly, it could fail in its day job of lending. That point is understood in the UK, as youâ€™d expect, so Flint and Wilmot-Sitwell need to preach to the non-converted. Theyâ€™ll never persuade FranÃ§ois Hollande, who wants euro-denominated trades to be cleared in the eurozone, that it is in Franceâ€™s own interests not to wreck the City. But HSBC and co could do everyone a service by prodding their big corporate clients on the continent to speak up. Itâ€™s now up to PM to reduce the cost of her Hinkley Point mistake It is too late, it seems, to persuade Theresa May that Hinkley Point is a colossal waste of money. But, at a bare minimum, letâ€™s hope the prime minister has succeeded in reducing the scandalous cost to consumers. EDF and its Chinese backers could expect to make a 10% rate of return under the old terms agreed in 2012. In todayâ€™s world, 7% would be generous.',\n",
              "  'Laurent Koscielny tap-in gives Arsenal win against Newcastle United Back in the height of summer when Petr Cech made his move across London, it was games as ragged and rickety as this that John Terry had in mind when he suggested the goalkeeper could be worth 12-15 points a season to Arsenal. ArsÃ¨ne Wengerâ€™s team were below par, the radar was off, the fatigue had set in, and they came up against a Newcastle team who made more than enough chances to upset the league leaders. Cech dealt with assurance with Newcastleâ€™s best efforts, which gave Arsenal the platform to eke out a win. Earning the points required resilience and the capacity to dig deep into their energy reserves. It was appropriate, perhaps, that the matchwinner was Laurent Koscielny, restored to the starting lineup after a much-needed breather. It was indicative of how this game went that Wenger confessed he felt for his opponents. â€œHonestly I am long enough in football to know if you are in Newcastleâ€™s place you feel sorry for them because they played very well,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI know also when you are capable to win and you havenâ€™t played well it shows a mental aspect of your team that is very important.â€\\x9d It left Steve McClaren ruing the outcome when he felt his players had earned the right to take something with them on the journey north. â€œIâ€™m scratching my head as to how we got nothing from that game,â€\\x9d he said. â€œNot many teams will come here and do that to Arsenal without getting something. â€œWe were aggressive, kept control, created chances. I couldnâ€™t fault what we tried to do. It was the complete performance without getting a result. Itâ€™s about putting the ball in the back of the net which is why they have the points and we donâ€™t.â€\\x9d Asked if the answer to his head scratching could take the form of a giant 33-year-old goalkeeper, McClaren did not disagree. â€œGoalkeepers win you matches and he certainly won that game,â€\\x9d he said. There were two particularly influential stops. In the first half Cech was alert to parry away Giorginio Wijnaldumâ€™s firm shot, and tidy up when Jack Colback followed up. At the start of the second half Aaron Ramsey ceded possession and the game opened up once again for the visitors. Ayoze PÃ©rez dinked a perfect pass for Wijnaldum. Cech spread himself to smother superbly. His interventions were hugely important on a day when Arsenal struggled to find their fluency. One of the perils of the festive football calendar is the likelihood of busy players looking as if they barely know if they are coming or going. There were leggy performances, lapses of concentration, and off-key passes scattered liberally across the drenched Emirates pitch. Wenger watched on from his dugout, quietly frustrated that his team were not functioning properly. Mesut Ã–zilâ€™s touch and movement were typically deft, but those around him strained to reach his level. The energy levels improved in the second half as the game opened up and both teams became more cavalier and increasingly desperate in their search for a goal. Newcastle came close as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Chancel Mbemba threatened. Arsenal perked up when Olivier Giroud flashed a header across goal, and then Ã–zil squeezed a brilliant pass towards Ramsey, whose shot was too tame to test Rob Elliot. In need of some inspiration, someone to take a risk or try something to force the issue, Koscielny stepped up to deliver in the 72nd minute. Giroud won headers in the box not once but twice after Ã–zil floated in a corner. Koscielny was alive to sneak in at the far post to plant a shot past Elliot. Wenger was more than satisfied with the outcome as an example they may need to draw on as the season wears on. â€œNot to drop points when you play like we did today is very important. It helps the team â€“ the memory of having done that before and winning the game helps you to hang on sometimes.â€\\x9d Trying to look at the bigger picture, he was in no mood to read too much into this match in terms of the title challenge. â€œItâ€™s too early. We have 42 points, letâ€™s be realistic. â€œLetâ€™s focus that we are in a strong position. We have given a lot over Christmas. At the end of the day how many points have you made in four games? We knew nine points would be acceptable, 10 ideal.â€\\x9d He made the point that only Manchester City managed 10 points last season. And they did not go on to win the Premier League. Wenger and McClaren were quiet about any potential business to strengthen their squads over January but admitted they are hard at work to bolster their options. The intensity of four festive games over, there is still not much time to pause for a moment, regroup, and go again.',\n",
              "  'NatWest criticised over loan to firm that evicted vulnerable families A bank in the majority taxpayer-owned RBS group lent money to property speculators for a deal that will see dozens of families evicted from their homes, it has emerged, prompting condemnation from the local MP and residents. NatWest has defended its decision to lend millions of pounds to the firm that bought 63 flats on a London estate so it could evict long-standing tenants and re-sell the homes for a profit, saying its only responsibility was to the customer who took out the loan. Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow who has campaigned stop the eviction of residents on the Butterfields estate in north-east London, said this made no sense. â€œFor NatWest to try to wash their hands of this doesnâ€™t stack up,â€\\x9d she said. â€œWe bailed out NatWest and they promised us we could now trust them to do the right thing. The right thing here is for NatWest to use their power to stop these evictions so we can get to the bottom of just what kind of deal has been done, which means the Butterfields residents are being made homeless.â€\\x9d For decades, the homes were owned by a local charity, Glasspool Trust, which makes grants to households in poverty. While not a housing charity it historically offered reduced rents, and many of the flats were occupied long-term by vulnerable families. But late last year the charity sold all its flats to a property developers without telling tenants, who only learned when the new owners began serving eviction notices in January. The developers, called Butterfields E17 Ltd, have since re-sold some of the flats for a profit. Companies House records show the firm took mortgages with NatWest against all 63 flats to buy them, and that the bank must approve any re-sale. A spokesman for the bank said he could not discuss individual cases but confirmed that it would be normal when a company is being lent a significant sum for it to talk the bank through the business plan for repaying the sum. Butterfields E17 Ltd has told the its plan is to evict the tenants from all 63 flats over time and seek to sell the properties for a profit. The spokesman said it was not up to the bank to take a moral view on such plans. He added: â€œOur defined responsibilities are to the customer who took these loans. These responsibilities do not extend to the day-to-day management of their property portfolio.â€\\x9d The fact the bank must approve any resale is a standard mortgage measure to ensure this was used to repay the mortgage, he added. The RBS group has a public sustainability and ethics policy, mainly connected to areas such as the environment and armaments. However, the policy says RBS tries not to make loans â€œwhich could damage the bankâ€™s reputationâ€\\x9d. Its executives have also talked repeatedly about seeking to be an ethical bank in the light of its 2008 takeover by the government, which still owns a majority of RBS shares. One of the Butterfields residents facing eviction, Nicole Holgate, called the NatWest justification â€œkind of patheticâ€\\x9d. â€œIf they claim to have any wider social and ethical responsibility then itâ€™s a horrendous move if a load of people are decamped from an area where they were making a perfectly reasonable living,â€\\x9d she said. â€œTheyâ€™re going to potentially have to get housing benefit wherever they end up, or a few people are eligible for council help.â€\\x9d Holgate, 28, lives with a flatmate, saying they were unusual among the dozen or so households currently facing eviction, with almost all the others having children. â€œThis is a huge problem for them,â€\\x9d she said. â€œTheyâ€™re in local schools, going to local churches and playgroups. They have really solid lives here and the societal cost of what an upheaval like this does to children is massive. â€œItâ€™s all just going to become more of a bill for everyone paying taxes.â€\\x9d The decision by Glasspool to sell the flats has prompted considerable local opposition. Creasy met the chair of the charity, Keith Nunn, at the Commons last month to seek an explanation for the deal. The meeting ended with the MP asking a policeman to escort Nunn out of parliament after, by her account, he said of the impact on tenants: â€œIt happens.â€\\x9d The directors of Butterfields E17, listed as Jasbir Singh Jhumat and Pardeep Singh Jhumat, have declined to comment throughout. However, another staff member told the they planned to evict more of the families and sell their flats in the future, depending on how well the properties sold.',\n",
              "  \"Amazon and Morrisons tie-up: a customer's guide What will Amazon sell? Amazon will offer customers hundreds of Morrisons products through its existing services, including fresh, frozen and chilled foods. Amazon will be able to choose which Morrisons products it sells and their price because the agreement is a standard wholesale deal between a retailer, Amazon, and a supplier, Morrisons. Amazon is unlikely to undercut Morrisonsâ€™ prices dramatically, however, because the supermarket chain could choose to pull out of the deal. The full list of products has not been released but Amazon says it will include orange juice, chocolate, spaghetti and soup. When will Morrisons products be available on Amazon? The partnership will start within the â€œcoming monthsâ€\\x9d. Do I need to switch from Morrisons.com to Amazon? No. Morrisons online service and supermarket will not be affected. Will Morrisons products be available nationwide on Amazon? Yes, although one-hour deliveries through Prime Now are currently available only in London, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool. Will I be able to buy Morrisons products as part of a wider shop on Amazon including other brands? Yes, Morrisons products will appear on Amazon in the same way that thousands of other brands do. Why has Morrisons signed up with a rival retailer? Amazon offers Morrisons another way to sell its products. Morrisons is one of the countryâ€™s biggest food manufacturers, producing much of its own-brand food. Its factories have empty capacity after the company closed shops, so this is a way to utilise them more effectively. Amazon is growing quickly in the grocery market and has powerful ambitions, with or without Morrisons, so this gives the Bradford-based retailer a way to benefit from its growth.\",\n",
              "  'Paul McCartney strikes out to gain control of his share of the Beatles catalogue Paul McCartney has begun the process of regaining control of his share of the US publishing rights in the Beatlesâ€™ catalogue. The publishing is currently owned by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, but US law allows living artists to apply to take back the right 56 years after initial publication, meaning the Lennon-McCartney catalogue becomes available in 2018. Billboard reports that McCartney began the process to taking control of his half of the Beatles publishing on 15 December 2015. Under the US copyright act of 1976, songwriter must file a claim with the copyright office two to 10 years before the 56 years elapse. McCartney filed a termination notice for 32 songs at the end of last year. However, John Lennonâ€™s half of the publishing â€“ all their songs were credited to Lennon-McCartney, regardless of who wrote them â€“ will remain with Sony/ATV which reportedly made a deal with Lennonâ€™s widow, Yoko Ono. The Beatles lost control of their publishing early on. The company Northern Songs was founded by Lennon, McCartney, their manager Brian Epstein and publisher Dick James in 1963, James, however, sold his stake to the UK firm Associated Television (ATV) in 1969, and Lennon and McCartney failed in an attempt to regain their rights. Another attempt by the music manager Allen Klein to set up a deal for the Beatlesâ€™ Apple Corps to buy out ATV also failed. Michael Jackson bought ATV Music for $47.5m (Â£33m) in 1985, which was reputed to have soured his friendship with McCartney, and merged his catalogue with Sony in 1995, for a payment of around Â£59m, resulting in the formation of Sony/ATV. In 2006, in financial trouble, Jackson struck a further deal with Sony, giving the former the right to buy his half of Sony/ATV. It was finally announced last week that the Jackson estate was to sell its 50% stake to Sony for $750m.',\n",
              "  'Elvis Costello: 10 of the best 1. Less Than Zero That Declan MacManus had been renamed Elvis Costello in the year that Elvis Presley died was merely a stroke of luck. When news filtered through that the King had died, a period of anxiety gripped the offices of the normally publicity savvy Stiff Records, though they neednâ€™t have worried; the seemingly disrespectful timing only added to the withering persona of the new upstart and agitator they were looking to promote. Whether apocryphal or not, the tale that NME were planning on running an Elvis vs Elvis: which one is a Stiff artist? editorial before good taste prevailed makes a good story. MacManus had spent considerable time honing his act with weekly shows at the Half Moon pub in Putney for 50p and a plate of sandwiches in the mid-70s, so by the time Stiff picked him up, he was able to emerge more or less fully formed into the publicâ€™s consciousness, a man as erudite as he was angry. His first single, Less Than Zero, was fittingly vituperative, spitting venom at the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, accusing him of engaging in incest to boot (â€œthe song was more of a slandering fantasy than a reasoned argument,â€\\x9d said the author). Mosley had apparently been the subject of a then recent TV documentary in which he reminisced misty-eyed about the Blackshirts. Whether American novelist Bret Easton Ellis had a grip on 1930s British politics or not, he named his first book after the song, and also his last novel to date â€“ the sequel â€“ pluralising Costelloâ€™s Imperial Bedroom. Less Than Zero the single is madly catchy and slightly unhinged, and simplistic enough that it fitted in with the burgeoning DIY punk movement; more musically accomplished offerings, like the 1940s-inspired Wave a White Flag, were quietly forgotten about. 2. Radio Radio Perhaps owing more to luck than judgment, Costello assembled one of the finest bands of the late 70s and early 80s in the Attractions, who appeared for the first time on his magnificent, Clash-mimicking first hit single, Watching the Detectives. By the time recording for the album This Yearâ€™s Model came around, they were knocking off mod-stomping classics like Pump it Up and (I Donâ€™t Want to Go to) Chelsea in one afternoon with Nick Lowe in the control booth. Another muscular anthem rescued from Elvisâ€™s days in the virtually unheard of pre-punk band Flip City, Radio Radio, was updated in order to bite the hand that fed him. â€œAnd the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools,â€\\x9d he spat, â€œtryinâ€™ to anaesthetise the way you feel.â€\\x9d With a sharp hook, a thumping rhythm and Steve Nieveâ€™s trademark swirly organ, the band were able to perform the song on Top of the Pops and sing the words right at presenter Tony Blackburn. The song caused further controversy in the US, when Elvis and the Attractions appeared on Saturday Night Live. Halfway through Less Than Zero the band suddenly stopped and played the prohibited Radio Radio instead. Elvis was banned for life from the show, a banishment that lasted all of 12 years. 3. Oliverâ€™s Army Having grown up a Beatles fanatic, Costello would have been honoured and presumably ecstatic when in 1987 the call came from Paul McCartney to write with him. Perhaps Costello could have imparted some tricks to McCartney, like how to write a protest song, especially regarding British colonialism and the Irish question. Musical genius he might be, but McCartneyâ€™s Give Ireland Back to the Irish was one of the limpest musical protests in the history of song, whereas Oliverâ€™s Army was so smart and subversive that many were unaware it was a protest song at all. They just heard the earworm on the radio, joined in with the singalong chorus and lapped up Steve Nieveâ€™s sparkling piano part, which owes a huge debt to Abbaâ€™s Dancing Queen, and then they went out and bought it in large numbers. According to Graeme Thomsonâ€™s Costello biography, Complicated Shadows, the band had no greater expectation for the song than for it to appear as a B-side when they premiered it at the Roskilde festival in Denmark in 1978. The following year, though, it reached No 2 in the charts, only kept off the top by the Bee Gees and then by Gloria Gaynor. The line â€œone more widow, one less white niggerâ€\\x9d caused little controversy at the time, though when Costello dropped the N-bomb into an argument with Stephen Stills and Bonnie Bramlett at a Holiday Inn in Ohio in March 1979 â€“ he provoked the row, and described Ray Charles as â€œa blind, ignorant niggerâ€\\x9d â€“ it had a disastrous effect on his US popularity. Allegedly high on amphetamines and booze and out to shock, Costello refused to apologise in a press conference for his remarks (his defence at the time was a curt â€œIâ€™m not a racistâ€\\x9d, and he had indeed played Rock Against Racism gigs), but he has been contrite on plenty of occasions since, a transgression presumably high up in his list of regrets. 4. Man Out of Time Whether it was the Holiday Inn incident or just the natural process of growing up, Costello slowly unwound as the 80s gathered pace. He still unleashed unbridled scorn now and again â€“ on Margaret Thatcher on 1989â€™s Tramp the Dirt Down and on Attractions bassist Bruce Thomas on 1991â€™s How to Be Dumb â€“ but he also appeared to become more reflective and less confrontational. The phrase â€œangry young manâ€\\x9d uses all three components for good reason, and by the time Costello came to record Imperial Bedroom with Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick in London in 1982, he was approaching 28 years old. â€œAt the time of Imperial Bedroom, I came to terms with the fact that I was sacrificing the power of certain songs to this mad pursuit of tempo,â€\\x9d he later reflected. â€œEverything had to be delivered forcefully. I donâ€™t know whether it was just a natural process or, literally, cumulative exhaustion of what were very intense years. Man Out of Time is the one time I said, â€˜No, stop. Letâ€™s play this at the right tempo.â€™â€\\x9d Bookended by an earlier noisier version, the song in between seemingly floats on some Dylanesque Highway 61-era Wurlitzer organ, carried along by a noirish narrative about a cabinet minister hiding out from a sex scandal. It also features the amusing rhyming couplet: â€œHâ€™s got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge / He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege.â€\\x9d Imperial Bedroom is for good or bad a record of maturity, with Man Out of Time the centrepiece around which everything falls. Costello sometimes overreaches, trying to accommodate too much in a song, but not here, somehow. (And when he does, well you canâ€™t fault him for his ambition.) 5. Shipbuilding Another protest song, this time about the Falklands war, Shipbuilding made the connection between a thriving shipyard â€“ a source of working-class pride â€“ and the fact fathers were sending their sons to war and to their deaths. Gritty, humane and deeply moving, Shipbuilding rates as one of Costelloâ€™s best lyrics, a fact not lost on the singer himself, who declared it so on several occasions. The music was written by Clive Langer with Robert Wyatt in mind, with the latter recording released on Rough Trade in 1982. Langer also produced Costelloâ€™s version when they worked together on the patchy Punch the Clock album in 1983, the song proving to be the highlight. Costelloâ€™s version gets the nod over the Wyatt version thanks to the stunning, mournful Chet Baker trumpet solo. â€œChet Baker, this wizened corpse on deathâ€™s door, strung out, just played,â€\\x9d said Bruce Thomas later. â€œHe followed this bass line and played his solo, so simple, with so much soul in it. It really touched me.â€\\x9d 6. I Want You Artists with a certain desperation are often the ones that impress Costello the most, from Springsteen and Van Morrison to Jeff Buckley, whom he picked to perform at the Queen Elizabeth Hall when curator of Meltdown in 1995 (it was to be Buckleyâ€™s last UK performance). Perhaps Costelloâ€™s most risque and desperate (on many levels) song is I Want You, a creeping first-person narrative that takes us through a fetid, all-consuming obsession. Sung to the object of the piece, it begins with what sounds like a lullaby, before quickly turning nasty, with the verses scratched out over some dampened chords while the voice barely conceals the anger of belonging to an unwelcome suitor. Each verse becomes a little more desperate, a little more deranged, while each line begins with the words â€œI want youâ€\\x9d, an emphatic refrain that becomes more and more awkward each time he utters it. â€œItâ€™s knowing that he knows you now after only guessing,â€\\x9d he sings, horrifying and horrified. â€œItâ€™s the thought of him undressing you or you undressing.â€\\x9d The lyrics and music together are intimately intense, like someone breathing down your own neck, making you shudder, but the melody is irresistible too. 7. Veronica If Costello was the master of smuggling dark subject matter into the charts without most people knowing what he was actually singing about (which actually annoyed him immensely), then 1989â€™s Veronica might well be the first top 40 hit that broached the difficult subject matter of Alzheimerâ€™s. â€œSheâ€™d talk about who knows what and the next minute itâ€™d be 40 years later,â€\\x9d says Costello, singing on a chair in a now vacant bedroom at the beginning of the video, â€œso youâ€™d just sit there and bounce around the years with her.â€\\x9d The Veronica in question was his own grandmother Mabel (Veronica was her middle name), and one of his finest, most immediate choruses, becomes a heartbreaker when you scratch a little deeper. Paul McCartney has a songwriting credit on the song, and also contributed Hofner bass (the Attractions had been jettisoned for a revolving door of musicians, as well as frequent contributors such as T-Bone Burnett). The working relationship between McCartney and Costello proved fruitful, and included one album, Flowers in the Dirt, though owing to creative differences related to production, Costello was apparently unhappy with the finished product, and his contribution was eventually somewhat diminished when the record finally surfaced. 8. The Other Side of Summer In 1991 Costello recorded Mighty Like a Rose â€“ which became known as the â€œbeard albumâ€\\x9d, on account of the fact he grew a beard, which would have been unthinkable in the clean-shaven punk years. Costello, a former computer operator (for Elizabeth Arden in Acton, before he hit the big time), discovered the practical merits of working with computer software whilst writing Mighty Like a Rose, which may explain why so much of the album is cluttered with melodies and yet more countermelodies. On the opening track, The Other Side of Summer, it works though; the song is a sarcastic Brian Wilson pastiche, a spectacular takedown of all things LA, with Costello in biting mood. â€œFrom the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf,â€\\x9d he sings cheerfully, â€œto the burning forests in the hills of Astroturf.â€\\x9d Thereâ€™s an environmental undercurrent too, and at the conclusion he warns: â€œGoodnight, God bless, and kiss goodbye to the earth.â€\\x9d Many of the lyrics on Mighty Like a Rose reflect apocalyptic concerns, with Hurry Down Doomsday (The Bugs Are Taking Over) coming across as just plain paranoid. Because of the clutter, the double tracking and maybe the beard, the words arenâ€™t always the easiest to decipher, though whether meanings were conveyed or not, The Other Side of Summer is a nailed-down fantastic tune that belongs in the canon. 9. Londonâ€™s Brilliant Parade Stick around for long enough in rockâ€™nâ€™roll and proclamations of comebacks are all but inevitable. Costelloâ€™s supposed dalliances with classical music with the Brodsky Quartet, and the album Now Ainâ€™t the Time for Your Tears penned for Wendy James over a weekend with then partner Cait Oâ€™Riordan, had for many detracted from his main body of work. So when he was heard to be back in the studio with Nick Lowe and members of the erstwhile Attractions it was all too much for some. The reviews for Brutal Youth were positive, the â€œreunionâ€\\x9d somewhat overegged, overshadowing what might be Costelloâ€™s finest work. Still Too Soon to Know, 13 Steps Lead Down, Kinder Murder, This is Hell, Sulky Girl, You Tripped at Every Step â€¦ every one is a classic. Londonâ€™s Brilliant Parade gets the nod because itâ€™s a beautifully nostalgic love letter to a city that once was, with little trace of Costelloâ€™s normally world-wearing irony or malice. The lyrics evoke the plot of a beloved old movie too: â€œSheâ€™s one of those girls that you just canâ€™t place / You feel guilty desiring such an innocent face,â€\\x9d sings Costello, â€œbut of course they knew that when they cast her / Along with the red Routemaster.â€\\x9d Glorious. 10. When I Was Cruel No 2 2002â€™s When I Was Cruel was supposedly another return to form, or if that wasnâ€™t quite true, it at least resembled the Costello brand. Featuring new band the Imposters, the album also marked a new fascination with looping drumbeats, best exemplified on the epic When I Was Cruel No 2. It is an ambient seven-minute exploration thatâ€™s more trip-hop than anything else; looping ad infinitum with a ghostly womanâ€™s voice at the end of each bar that also recalls Gainsbourg and Bardotâ€™s Bonnie & Clyde. When I Was Cruel was released on Def Jam, and his curiosity about hip-hop culminated in a collaboration with the Roots in 2013, with mixed results. Most of the choices in this 10 of the best were selected from within the realms of rock, often at its most straightforward, because despite his obvious abilities, acerbic rockâ€™nâ€™roll is what Elvis Costello does best (whether he likes it or not).',\n",
              "  'RBS suffers fresh setback in Williams & Glyn spin-off plan Royal Bank of Scotlandâ€™s attempts to spin off 315 branches have received another setback after one of the highest-profile bidders pulled out. Santander, which originally had an agreement to buy the branches in 2012, has withdrawn from talks again in a blow to the latest efforts by the bailed-out bank to dispose of the branches. The 73% taxpayer-owned RBS has been instructed to spin off the branches â€“ which it is rebranding Williams & Glyn â€“ by the EU as a penalty for its 2008 taxpayer rescue. Lloyds Banking Group was required to sell off TSB, which after a brief period on the stock market has since been bought by Sabadell of Spain. The disposal of W&G is proving troublesome and expensive for RBS, which stunned the City last month by admitting it was abandoning its attempt to float the business on the stock market. RBS has spent Â£1.5bn trying to carve out the branches, largely comprising NatWest locations in Scotland and RBS outlets in England and Wales, which employ 5,500. The new branch network has been a key plank of government plans to create fresh competition on the high street. It is thought to be valued at Â£1.3bn. As the result of a complex deal agreed by RBS in 2013, after the first Santander talks broke down, the abandonment of the flotation means that the bailed-out bank is paying millions of pounds to a private equity consortium, which was due to back the share offering. The consortium includes the Church of England. Other possible bidders for W&G branches include the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banking group, which was sold off by National Australia Bank earlier this year. RBS and the UK arm of Santander declined to comment.',\n",
              "  'Walter Mazzarri hails Stefano Okaka after Watford rally to hold off Everton Ronald Koeman has made his reputation as a canny, pragmatic manager in the Premier League but his Everton side were made to look naive by Watford as they maximised their opportunities to take all three points. After being outplayed on the pitch, the Dutchman failed to cover himself in glory after the match either. Rightly furious at his team letting a 1-0 lead become a 3-1 deficit before Romelu Lukakuâ€™s second restored a sheen of credibility, he described his team as â€œreactive, not proactiveâ€\\x9d. But he also saw fit to criticise, more than once, his opponentsâ€™ style of play. Walter Mazzarri smiled when he heard that the Dutchman had described his team as â€œdirect and aggressiveâ€\\x9d. Yes, his side had scored twice from set pieces, and yes the move that led to their opening goal had begun with a long ball from the back. But Mazzarri knew what had happened on the pitch, and Watford had been better in every department. â€œEach person has his opinion, luckily we all have eyes to see,â€\\x9d the Italian said through his interpreter. â€œI think you have all seen who played better today, who played good football. Every person has an opinion, but I donâ€™t agree with him.â€\\x9d Watfordâ€™s star performer was Stefano Okaka. The striker arrived from Anderlecht in the summer for an undisclosed fee but his season has been disrupted by injury. This was only his second start of the season, his first came last week, but he looked anything but rusty as he pirouetted to score Watfordâ€™s equaliser in the 36th minute. After Sebastian PrÃ¶dl gave Watford the lead with a towering header in the 59th minute, Okaka produced one of his own four minutes later. He lost his marker to meet JosÃ© Holebasâ€™s corner at the near post and flick the ball past Maarten Stekelenburg. The Italian was withdrawn late on to a standing ovation. â€œIâ€™ve known him since he was very young and playing for Roma, heâ€™s a great talent,â€\\x9d said Mazzari, who gave the striker a bear hug after his opening goal. â€œWe had the opportunity to sign him in the summer and we took it. He is perfect for the Premier League because he doesnâ€™t only help himself but helps his team-mates to play well and score.â€\\x9d Where Everton would have been without their own two-goal striker is anyoneâ€™s guess. Lukaku opened the scoring when he coolly finished off Gareth Barryâ€™s wonderful long ball, ironically Evertonâ€™s best pass of the game. The Belgian closed it out with a surefire header from the substitute Aaron Lennonâ€™s cross. In between times, however, he was largely marooned, waiting hopefully for crosses that rarely came. After criticising Ross Barkleyâ€™s lack of productivity during the week, Koeman once again left the England international on the bench. His replacement, James McCarthy, looked entirely at sea in a nominal No10 role. Gerard Deulofeu tried hard on the right-hand side, while Kevin Mirallas was anonymous on the left. And these are the players who apparently make Everton more of a footballing side than their opponents. â€œThe Premier League is not always about football qualities, itâ€™s about physicality, about second balls and in that respect the team is too weak,â€\\x9d Koeman said. â€œWe have too much to do when teams like this play direct and aggressive. â€œWe have different players, different qualities but in that aspect we have to improve and do better. You canâ€™t change that in two weeks. You need January, you need the summer to change what you need as a team. We need a better balance.â€\\x9d Everton had a late penalty appeal when Miguel Britos manhandled the substitute Enner Valencia to prevent him jumping for a cross but Watford now sit in the top half of the table, with Mazzarri about to get his first experience of the Premier League Christmas period. â€œIn Italy we donâ€™t have games so close at Christmas but Iâ€™m not worried about it,â€\\x9d Mazzarri said. â€œAll Iâ€™m worried about is that my squad is not fully fit. If we had the complete squad Iâ€™d be very happy.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"HSBC's gunboat diplomacy worked well. Too well Spring 2015 HSBC announces during the general election campaign that it is thinking about moving its global HQ from London to Kong Kong, citing unhappiness about City regulation in general and George Osborneâ€™s bank levy in particular. Summer 2015 Newly reappointed chancellor in a majority Conservative government, Osborne announces he is going to reform the bank levy in a way that makes it less onerous for HSBC. The chancellor says it is time for a new settlement with the City, and demonstrates what that means by getting rid of Martin Wheatley as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Wheatleyâ€™s crime? Being too tough on the banks. February 2016 HSBC announces that, following an exhaustive, bottom-up review, it has decided to remain domiciled in London. The bankâ€™s chairman, Douglas Flint, insists there was no deal with the government; no arm-twisting from an institution that is one of the biggest companies quoted on the FTSE 100; certainly not a gigantic game of bluff. Three big questions arise from the HSBC decision. The first is whether the bank ever really intended to leave the UK. As Andre Spicer of the Cass Business School notes, the assumption that multinational corporations are footloose and fancy free doesnâ€™t really square with the facts. Between 1996 and 2006, a decade that could be argued was the high point of globalisation, only 6% of multinationals moved their HQ. London is a good place for an international bank to be domiciled. The time zone is right, a dense network of support services is available, and executives feel at home. It would probably have taken more than a gripe about the bank levy and unhappiness about Wheatleyâ€™s â€œshoot first, ask questions laterâ€\\x9d approach to have prompted HSBC to uproot. The second question is whether, in the light of that, Osborne paid too high a price to keep HSBC here. The answer to that is that he did. The changes have resulted in the tax burden being shifted to the new challenger banks which are meant to be providing much-needed competition to the high street big four, leaving weaker oversight of the financial system. Osborne may live to regret this if the gyrations in the markets really do portend a re-run of 2008. Finally, what does this episode say about the power of the banks? Quite a lot. HSBC was founded in 1865, a year that coincided with the death of Lord Palmerston, famed as foreign secretary for his gunboat diplomacy. Flint sailed his gunboat up the Thames from Canary Wharf and moored it within sight of the Palace of Westminster. There didnâ€™t need to be any negotiation. Osborne got the message.\",\n",
              "  'Is pessimism really bad for you? The glass can be half-full, or it can be half-empty, depending on your outlook on life â€“ or on which side of the bed you get out of any particular morning. But can optimism or indeed pessimism really affect your health? Itâ€™s been a bone of contention for many years, and the issue has spawned a plethora of self-help guides on how to be â€œpositiveâ€\\x9d, especially in the face of serious illness. But the scientific evidence in support of a sunny disposition is contentious, contradictory and controversial. The latest study comes from Finland, a land not noted for its joie de vivre. The conclusion of this research, published last week in BMC Public Health, found that pessimism was associated with an increased risk of death from coronary heart disease. Of the 121 Finnish men and women who had died from coronary heart disease during the studyâ€™s 11-year follow-up period â€“ out of 2,267 participants â€“ the researchers found a significant preponderance of pessimism when the study began. Comparing the higher and lower quartiles (the top and bottom 25%), people in the higher quartile for pessimism had a 2.2-fold higher risk of dying from heart disease than those in the lower quartile. It seemed to support the idea that optimism is good for you. But hang on. There was a catch â€“ because the researchers also looked at optimism in the same group of middle-aged Finns and failed to find any association with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease. So whatâ€™s going on? Well, one of the problems in previous studies on optimism and pessimism is that the two attitudes have been treated much like opposite ends of the same emotional spectrum. This produced conflicting results, according to the researchers, led by Mikko Pankalainen, a psychiatrist at the Paijat-Hame hospital in Lahti, southern Finland. â€œPeople should not be categorised as optimists or pessimists,â€\\x9d the researchers concluded. â€œPessimism seems to be quite a significant risk factor for death from coronary heart disease both in men and women, while optimism does not protect from it.â€\\x9d It is not the first time that pessimism has been linked with ill health, although this study claims to be the first to link it negatively with coronary heart disease. â€œHigh levels of pessimism have previously been linked to factors that affect cardiac death, such as inflammation, but data on the connection between risk of death from coronary heart disease and optimism and pessimism as personality traits are relatively scarce,â€\\x9d Pankalainen said. But it must be emphasised that these studies only point to an association, rather than cause and effect. None can claim to show that being pessimistic actually causes someone to die prematurely. Levels of pessimism could be measured â€œquite easilyâ€\\x9d, Pankalainen said, by asking people to respond to a series of gloomy statements, such as â€œif something can go wrong for me, it willâ€\\x9d. Measuring optimism, on the other hand, relied on responses to statements such as â€œin uncertain times, I usually expect the bestâ€\\x9d. When they carried out the statistical analysis on the two sets of outlooks, the researchers found no link between risk of heart deaths and optimism. This runs contrary to a previous study of optimism, published in Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association in 2011. It measured optimism levels on a 16-point scale in a â€œrepresentative groupâ€\\x9d of just over 6,000 men and women and found that for every point increase in optimism, there was a corresponding 9% decrease in acute strokes over the two-year follow-up period. â€œOur work suggests that people who expect the best things in life actively take steps to promote health,â€\\x9d lead author Eric Kim of the University of Michigan said at the time. â€œOptimism seems to have a swift impact on stroke.â€\\x9d So the suggestion here was that optimistic people tended to look after themselves better than pessimistic individuals â€“ so they perhaps had better diets and exercised more. However, there are no shortage of claims that optimism can also have a physical effect on the body by, for instance, boosting the immune system. One such study carried out on 124 law students in the US in 2010 showed how the immune response waxed and waned depending on a personâ€™s optimism or pessimism. Although there seems no getting away from the fact that most studies show that being optimistic can increase the chances of surviving with cancer, or improve the wellbeing of those with neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsonâ€™s, the optimists do not always have it all their own way. At least one study has shown that older people with an optimistic outlook on life were more likely than pessimists to suffer disability and death within the following decade. Being grumpy when you are old may actually pay off. And if you are a glass-half-empty person desperately trying to see it as half-full for the sake of your health, there is bad news from yet another study carried out in 2006, showing that we learn to be positive or negative in childhood. And one of the best ways of predicting a personâ€™s optimism turns out to be whether they were raised in a family where the parents were of a high socioeconomic status. Who said money isnâ€™t everything?',\n",
              "  'Did arthouse horror hit The Witch trick mainstream US audiences? Critically acclaimed horror film The Witch broke out from the arthouse circuit at the weekend and became a surprise hit with mainstream audiences, making $8.4m (Â£6m) from a budget of just $1m. Good news all round, huh? Well, certainly for indie distributors A24, who have previously had relatively small successes with Ex Machina and Room. The opening was the biggest theyâ€™ve ever had and its screen average was second only to Deadpool in the Top 10. Also for critics, who had championed the film since it screened at last yearâ€™s Sundance and whose words had graced the filmâ€™s haunting marketing campaign. But there was one important group who walked away feeling cheated: the audience. While The Witch landed with almost universally positive reviews (itâ€™s at 88% on Rotten Tomatoes), most came with an important caveat. Yes, the film, a 17th-century-set tale of alleged witchcraft and mass hysteria, has been called â€œunsettlingâ€\\x9d and â€œchillingâ€\\x9d but itâ€™s also been referred to as difficult. The â€™s Jordan Hoffman said that it was â€œtoo slow and verbose to become the next breakout horror hitâ€\\x9d, while the New Yorkerâ€™s Anthony Lane said audiences will â€œrightly ask if The Witch even deserves to be called a horror flickâ€\\x9d. Due to the more cerebral nature of the film, A24â€™s original plan was to give it a limited theatrical run, accompanied by a simultaneous VOD release, in what has become a more standard strategy for films of this size. But, given the filmâ€™s easy-to-market title, a range of excitable reviews and the fact that horror films are still reliable money-makers, their plan shifted and an arthouse pic was suddenly being offered up alongside Deadpool in more than 2,000 US cinemas. It was also a smartly picked weekend with just under-the-radar titles such as faith-based epic Risen and sports biopic Race to compete with. After Thursday previews, A24 knew their gamble had paid off with a $630k start, implying a weekend total of $16m. But word of mouth soon spread and the film ended with half that â€“ admirable for a film of this scale but it was already a victim of thwarted expectations. Opening-night audiences were surveyed and it received a disappointing C- grade via Cinemascore, a company that specialises in gauging the opinion of cinemagoers. The reaction on social media was similarly underwhelmed. Horror is one of the few genres that manages to draw crowds in without having to rely on big stars and brand awareness. This year alone, films with similarly opaque titles such as The Boy and The Forest have managed decent totals ($33m and $26m) from small budgets. The majority of audiences werenâ€™t going to see The Witch because they loved Kate Dickie in Red Road; they were hoping to be scared. But itâ€™s not the first horror film to have pleased critics but frustrated the masses: The Blair Witch Project (Rotten Tomatoes: 86%, Cinemascore: C+) The Cabin in the Woods (Rotten Tomatoes: 92%, Cinemascore: C) Let Me In (Rotten Tomatoes: 88%, Cinemascore: C+) Oculus (Rotten Tomatoes: 73%, Cinemascore: C) Piranha 3D (Rotten Tomatoes: 73%, Cinemascore: C) The Mist (Rotten Tomatoes: 73%, Cinemascore: C) Even for those who shell out for tickets, horror is incredibly divisive. If a film is too gory or too nasty then it can offend (both Wolf Creek and Saw received an F), while if you leave audiences scared but depressed they will also be unhappy (even hits like Sinister and The Purge could only manage a C+ and a C). But what audiences hate the most is feeling cheated. In 2012, low-budget horror The Devil Inside came out of nowhere to make a remarkable $33m in its opening weekend but the crowds turned against it with a toxic F rating and a second week decline of 76%. Why? The film ends with an unresolved incident and a URL directing viewers to find out more information. Hardly going to lead to ringing endorsements all round ... But while audiences might have headed to see a new film called The Witch and expected to see something far more conventional, can distributors A24 really be to blame? Whatâ€™s interesting about the filmâ€™s relative success is that the marketing campaign was fairly muted and mainly digitally focused. The filmâ€™s TV spots were surprisingly restrained and artful, refraining from pushing it as something it clearly wasnâ€™t. Any expectations were based on what one might expect from a horror film being released on such a wide scale, rather than what the film was sold as. While itâ€™s likely that the film will suffer in its second week, itâ€™s of little consequence. A small budget and a cheap marketing spend mean that the film is already in profit. Itâ€™s also pleased critics that a horror film of this quality is being seen by so many people, having already outgrossed other recent favourite The Babadook and likely to eclipse It Follows within the next week. The genre is, quite fairly, still maligned by most, with cookie-cutter dross dumped in cinemas month after month (The Boy and The Forest managed 30% and 10% on Rotten Tomatoes). It might also lead to other small distributors rethinking release strategies for modest genre fare, ideally titles that start with â€œTheâ€\\x9d followed by a creepy word. So, while the social media fury may still continue (â€œThe witch was the worst movie fucking made mad I wasted my money on that shitâ€\\x9d), the scariest thing for many fans is that they might end up watching other films that donâ€™t conform to their expectations and one day â€“ gasp â€“ they might actually start enjoying them.',\n",
              "  'The 50 best films of 2016 in the UK: No 7 Little Men Ira Sachsâ€™s Little Men is a beautifully acted generational drama, a coming of age, boyâ€™s own story of lost friendship and a pessimistic satire about gentrification â€“ all composed with scrupulous observational care. Greg Kinnear and Jennifer Ehle play Brian and Kathy, a decent if somewhat self-pitying guy and his wife. Brian is an actor whose career is dying, and when he inherits a property in Brooklyn from his late father there is a chance for some real financial stability. He realises he is within his rights to hike the rent being charged to the woman who has a dress shop in the downstairs apartment. But the exquisitely painful problem â€“ quite aside from their liberal middle-class embarrassment at needing or wanting to do this â€“ is that the womanâ€™s son has befriended their son, and saved him from loneliness. Brian and Kathy actually owe this woman a lot. But Brian also owes something to his sister, who has her own money worries, and they overwhelmingly feel that they owe themselves a fair bit as well. It is an agonising anatomy of divided loyalties, made much more poignant and real by the lovely performances of Michael Barbieri and Theo Taplitz as the two teenagers whose friendship continues alongside, or above, the adultsâ€™ undignified wrangling over money. There is something quietly and intimately tragic about how this relationship pans out, and their final scene together is haunting. The 50 best films of 2016 in the UK',\n",
              "  'How to blag a job in finance: buy some black shoes and â€‹talk like an aristocrat Thereâ€™s supposed to be a war for talent. If so, it became pretty clear last week why Britainâ€™s investment banks are losing it. The recruitment filter, revealed in a report from the Social Mobility Commission, works like this: you can only join the customer-facing part of an investment bank if you went to one of four public schools; got a first from one of five universities; and possess â€œsheenâ€\\x9d. Yes, sheen. And polish. No matter how good you are, if your tie is not right or your suit does not fit like a glove, you are destined to take your excellence somewhere else. Little wonder, then, that the world of investment banking suffers from group-think on a scale that crashed the world markets in 2008 and has led to wave after wave of fines for fraudulent behaviour. Given that the signifiers are so clear and obvious, how would you scam your way in? How would you hoodwink the informal process based on â€œspecific behaviours, speech patterns and dress codesâ€\\x9d? Unwittingly, the commissionâ€™s report provides plenty of clues. First, the obvious donâ€™ts. No beards. Not Muslim ones, not hipster ones, not the stubble worn by movie stars. None. One of the clearest demographic faultlines in the world runs along White Kennett Street, in east London â€“ where the beards of hipsterland begin and the twice-shaven faces of the City end. Also, no brown shoes. In fact, the brown-shoes thing, plus numerous other faux-pas, can be easily avoided by reading GQ magazine. But buy the British edition because if you read the Italian one you are going to arrive in the wrong kind of suit, shoes and â€“ very important, this â€“ socks. I once met a management whizz-kid thrown out of his City internship for wearing plaid socks. You need the haircut, the suit, the shoes, the tie. They are all â€“ like the outmoded economic theories you will have to waffle on about â€“ available as a job lot in and around Savile Row. The suit has to be blue or grey. Sure, you will see electric-blue suits, or pinstripes, on the streets of the Square Mile, but donâ€™t try to pull this off unless your familyâ€™s yacht has a helicopter pad. Shoes have to be black leather and click as you strut along a corridor, shutting down venerated retail chains by text message. The bankers surveyed were disdainful of people who â€œcanâ€™t wear a suitâ€\\x9d. To their jaundiced eyes, this means you have bought a suit off the peg, and cannot afford six grand to have one made that immobilises you at the armpits and makes your bum look like that of a figure skater. The haircut has to be bouffant. One of the surest signs you have walked into a workplace that recruits only from the elite is that the haircuts do not change. Neat back and sides, big bouffant quiff, no gel, no wax, no putty. These are the marks of convicts or advertising men, not the front-office banker. All this is fakeable, with money, practice, a willing tailor and obedient hair. But then you need to open your mouth to speak. Take careful note of whatâ€™s happening to the â€œposhâ€\\x9d English accent. It is no longer enough to have the calm, fruitily inflected RP common among barristers. More fashionable now is the â€œRees-Moggâ€\\x9d â€“ a throwback to the accent of the aristocracy in the 1920s, where the consonant â€œrâ€\\x9d migrates slightly towards â€œwâ€\\x9d and even spontaneous utterances sound like they have been written by Michael Gove. This is achievable with practice. Next you need subject matter. The Laffer curve, which attempts to illustrate that taxing the rich is futile, is a good thing to talk about. Also the work of any fashionably rightwing African economist. And Venezuela. If in doubt, diss Venezuela. But â€“ and this is critical â€“ you must understand that words are not the primary medium of communication. If you are going organise a team to fix Libor, you donâ€™t say â€œletâ€™s fix Liborâ€\\x9d. You use subtle understatements, allusions, metaphors, sentences that trail off, eyebrows that curl independently. To learn this you have to hang around in places like St Moritz, and not just for a single season. As to the CV, you must make it up. The four spring internships claimed by elite candidates in their first year at university (the new normal according to the report) come in limited supply. Apart from the sons and daughters of the bankers themselves, most other places will be reserved for the offspring of Arab despots and Russian crooks. And if you are proud of having climbed in Glencoe on your Duke of Edinburgh award, be aware thatâ€™s not good enough. You must have, at the very least, discovered a new species in the Amazon while in the lower sixth, or still better, a new tribe. You must have proof of this on Facebook and Instagram. Also references from Nobel prize-winning economists. Fortunately, itâ€™s all fakeable. But here comes the unfakeable part. You must go into that interview not just with a tie from Ede & Ravenscroft and shoes from Lobb. You must go in believing that it is the duty of high finance to avoid tax, rewrite the law of sovereign states, enrich dictators, boost inequality and â€“ in return â€“ voluntarily clean up litter in Haringey on the annual away day. Above all, you must subscribe to the efficient-markets hypothesis so unequivocally that it becomes your religion. This says itâ€™s the job of the financial market to allocate capital efficiently. Centuries of good practice show that capital can only be allocated efficiently when the participants in the deal played rugby with each other at the age of 12.',\n",
              "  \"God's Not Dead 2 review â€“ only brief instances of transcendent badness When conversation turns to the entertainment value of the recent â€œfaith-basedâ€\\x9d films aimed at the US evangelical market, inevitably someone will say: â€œNothing tops that Kevin Sorbo one.â€\\x9d The picture in question is Godâ€™s Not Dead, an outrageously slapdash, inarticulate movie filled with ludicrous plotting, inelegant staging and one of cinemaâ€™s most absurd endings. (The big bad atheist gets hit by a car, just as the Christian rock band Newsboys tells everyone in the audience to text their friends that God isnâ€™t dead.) Shot for only $2m, it grossed more than $60m, enabling its production company, Pure Flix, to release follow-ups such as Do You Believe? and Faith of Our Fathers. But franchises are the thing right now, so itâ€™s not surprising that Pure Flixâ€™s most bankable title would rise again. Godâ€™s Not Dead 2 is a much better movie than Godâ€™s Not Dead, but thatâ€™s a bit like saying a glass of milk left on the table hasnâ€™t curdled and is merely sour. Though the main characters are different, a few of the side players have returned, and once again the big villain is academia â€“ in this case a high school where Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart), a very nice teacher and woman of faith, accidentally trips up and quotes scripture to her students. No reasonable person would ever accuse her of proselytising, but a conversation in her history class on the nonviolence of Gandhi and Dr Martin Luther King also touches upon the teachings of Christ. Wesley specifically says â€œthe author of the Gospels attributes Jesus as saying ...â€\\x9d, but in the paranoid world of Harold Cronkâ€™s film, itâ€™s enough to open up the fires of damnation. Soon (ridiculously soon, if you know how the legal system works, but letâ€™s not get into that) Grace Wesley is on trial. But what is really on trial here? Itâ€™s an obvious question, but in case you donâ€™t ask it, youâ€™ll be prompted by a reporter seated in the courtroom who whips out her notebook and writes â€œWhatâ€™s really on trial here?â€\\x9d in big letters. Itâ€™s that type of movie. She is not just any reporter â€“ she is the liberal blogger from the first Godâ€™s Not Dead, Amy (Trisha LaFache), who had advanced cancer but, after meeting the Newsboys, accepted Jesus and is now cured. (No mention is given to the advances of medical science.) The other big connection to the first Godâ€™s Not Dead is that one of the jurors is the earlier filmâ€™s Pastor Dave (played by Pure Flixâ€™s co-founder David AR White), whose scruffy blonde hair and worldly luck have just enough of that Jesus-is-just-alright-with-me vibe to make him extremely likable. Pastor Dave is calm, welcoming and warm, which is why itâ€™s a bit surprising when Godâ€™s Not Dead 2 gets so belligerent in the face of perceived persecution. Dave and other local preachers are forced to turn in copies of their recent sermons to the authorities, â€œjust like in Houstonâ€\\x9d. This is a reference to a one-off, highly localised subpoena in a 2014 investigation into tax-exempt institutions violating civil rights, that was quickly rescinded. . That context isnâ€™t discussed here. Instead, itâ€™s like Roman times: there is a war over belief, and it is going to take sacrifice to win it. But much like the script of Godâ€™s Not Dead 2, weâ€™re letting tangents distract us from the primary story: the trial. Ray Wise practically has a serpentâ€™s tongue as the sleazy American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who wants to destroy this nice, blonde, cardigan-wearing teacher who lives with her ill father (Pat Boone!) and just wants to serve God. There are a number of witness-stand showdowns, such as with the daughter of the atheist parents leading the suit (who has since found Jesus â€“ whoopsie!), and with the scholars who cite theories such as the â€œunintended eyewitness support systemâ€\\x9d to â€œproveâ€\\x9d that Jesusâ€™s words were true. (Also, keep your ears open for plugs of Man Myth Messiah, the latest book by Rice Broocks, Pure Flixâ€™s inhouse scribe.) For those looking to get riled up about how evil trends such as diversity are preventing people from believing in Jesus, thereâ€™s more than enough red meat in Godâ€™s Not Dead 2. For those looking to howl at wretched acting like in Kevin Sorboâ€™s death scene in the last one, alas, the sequel is a bit of a disappointment. It is unfortunately just professional enough that there are only brief instances of transcendent badness, rather than drawn-out sequences. Instead of a lengthy cameo from a member of the Duck Dynasty clan there is a brief talking-head moment from Mike Huckabee, and the most urgent speechifying here canâ€™t hold a candle to anything in last summerâ€™s surprise hit War Room in terms of church kitsch. The trial scenes go on forever, but despite the two-hour run time, itâ€™s worth staying to the very end. Pure Flix has learned from Marvel, and a post-credits stinger tees up Godâ€™s Not Dead 3, whether weâ€™ve prayed for it or not.\",\n",
              "  'Garry Marshall: a genuine mensch who made everything improbably joyous Even if Garry Marshall had put down his pen and stopped working entirely at the end of the 1970s, his career would still be hailed today with the cliche of legendary and his death would still feel as if it marked the similarly cliched end of an era. After working as a joke writer for comedians such as Joey Bishop and Jack Paar (whose names alone are as redolent of mid-20th-century America as an Edsel), he smoothly moved into TV production. In a near unrivalled run, he created The Odd Couple, Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley and Mork & Mindy, thereby helping to launch the careers of Ron Howard (who had been a child actor, but became an adult star after Happy Days), Henry Winkler, his sister, Penny Marshall, and, most of all, Robin Williams. It is almost impossible to imagine the world of 70s American television without Marshall. But Marshall, a cheerful workaholic, didnâ€™t stop there. In the 80s and 90s, he branched out into movies, making two of the most beloved staples of girlsâ€™ nights in: Bette Midlerâ€™s schlocky celebration of female friendship, Beaches, and Pretty Woman, a film as bizarre for its sexual politics as it is irresistible. The 1987 film Overboard, in which a working-class handyman (Kurt Russell) tricks an amnesiac wealthy woman (Goldie Hawn) into being his wife, had an even more deranged storyline than Pretty Woman. Yet both exemplify Marshallâ€™s lucrative skill at taking the most unlikely material and, with his light and jaunty touch, turning it into something improbably joyous. One of his earlier and best movies, 1984â€™s The Flamingo Kid, starring Matt Dillon and HÃ©ctor Elizondo, about a working-class boy who becomes enamoured of the wealthy lifestyles of the people whose towels he cleans at a posh beach club, took the grit of class angst and turned it into a pearl of a coming-of-age film. After establishing with Pretty Woman that the 90s would be the decade of big-budget romcoms, Marshall cannily followed his own trend. Runaway Bride was released in 1999, followed by The Princess Diaries in 2001, a movie that sensed the imminent Disney princess obsession. He was also a welcome presence as an actor, and it was always a thrill to hear his chewy Bronx accent on-screen, whether with a recurring role in the 90s TV show Murphy Brown, or a charming cameo, such as in Pennyâ€™s A League of Their Own in 1992. He maintained a wide-eyed eagerness to know what was hot with the kids up to the end, and recently appeared in cult TV shows Brooklyn Nine-Nine and BoJack Horseman. Marshallâ€™s holiday-themed movies, Valentineâ€™s Day, New Yearâ€™s Eve and Motherâ€™s Day, have been mocked by everyone from film critics to Tina Fey. But the public liked them, and thatâ€™s all he ever cared about. The last of these came out this summer, starring Julia Roberts â€“ his original Pretty Woman â€“ because, even at the age of 81, Marshall just wanted to make people laugh. His memoirs, Wake Me When Itâ€™s Funny and My Happy Days in Hollywood, about his professional life and his 53-year marriage to Barbara and their three children, proved that Marshall was, as those who watched his work had long suspected, that rare thing: a Hollywood legend who was also a genuine mensch.',\n",
              "  'Brains and bone saws: a day with the chief medical examiner of New York City The smell in the autopsy room is indescribable. It lingers on your clothes and in your hair long after you leave. Staff are constantly cleaning the linoleum floors and wiping down every surface with harsh disinfectants. But if anything, it adds to the uniquely acrid odor. You never get used to the smell, says Jennifer Hammers, deputy chief medical examiner for Kings County, New York â€“ but you do get beyond it. Iâ€™ve been allowed a privileged glimpse at a regular Wednesday in the Brooklyn office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. The office is one of the busiest of its kind in the country. Around 70,000 people die in New York City each year, and about 8,000-9,000 of them end up at the medical examiner, requiring further investigation. Of those, 5,000 are autopsied. Only the lonely In the basement, the staff are hard at work in the autopsy suite, carefully examining the bodies and photographing relevant organs for their reports. Most cases brought to the medical examiner are not crime related. In a city of over 8 million people, with many immigrants and transplants from other parts of the country, there is no shortage of the lonely. Of the seven bodies brought in today, three have died alone in their apartments. In the summer, without air conditioning, it can take as little as two days before the smell of a body causes neighbors to make a call. One gentleman found alone in his home is now lying before me on a steel gurney. James Daniels, a lead forensic mortuary technician, is carefully removing the scalp before cutting the skull with a bone saw so the brain can be examined for any signs of aneurysm, stroke or other potential causes of death. Over 60 forensic mortuary technicians like Daniels work in New York City. While the 31 medical examiners in New York City are all highly trained physicians who completed special fellowships, technicians donâ€™t have any educational requirements. Typically, technicians join when they are young and only have a high school education. They learn the intricacies of their job on site. Without them, the office would cease to function. They are the ones dispatched to collect the bodies for autopsy. They are often the first people from the office a family encounters when grieving. Being the doctorâ€™s doctor In addition to the medical examiners, there are x-ray technicians who scan for bullets and broken bones; DNA and toxicology laboratory staff; consulting dentists for matching dental records for identification; anthropologists who specialize in discovering the race, age and height of skeletal remains and figuring out what tools caused blunt force traumas; mortuary technicians who assist with autopsies; a variety of administrators; death scene investigators; and professional photographers who take careful photos of every autopsy for detailed record keeping. One of the photographers on staff also takes professional photos of food, Hammers tells me with a smile. While the doctors examine the body and determine the cause of death, the technicians do a lot of careful and very skilled cutting to assist them. They also clean the bodies after the autopsy is completed, making sure that it is in a pristine state when handed over to a funeral director. For Daniels, who started with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner as a young man in 1989, it was an unexpected career choice, as he hated the idea of being around dead bodies and avoided funerals entirely. Most of the medical examiners, on the other hand, said they always loved the idea of solving a mystery, of being â€œthe doctorâ€™s doctorâ€\\x9d. They wanted to be the ones to determine the real cause of a death or diagnose a pathology. Daniels had a more pragmatic reason for joining the office: he needed a job, and working for the city meant stable employment. When he first started, he dreaded touching bodies and entering strangersâ€™ homes. It was fear of the unknown, he explains. But these days, working as a lead technician, there is little left unknown when it comes to the dead. Daniels was on the job during 9/11. He also responded to Flight 587, which crashed in Queens in November 2001, killing everyone on board. That time created his worst memories of the job. But it also gave him the greatest sense of the workâ€™s importance: none of those families would otherwise have had closure. He now â€œloves the jobâ€\\x9d, he says. The case that hits home No matter how long they have been working at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and how many bodies they have seen, everyone has a case that hits home. For Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner for New York City, it was a 9/11 case. The terror attack on 9/11, which Sampson refers to as the biggest homicide in US history, was a difficult time for all of the staff at the office. They worked round the clock to identify bodies, and the images they saw still haunt most of them fifteen years later. Identification often had to be done from DNA analysis of fragments of remains and is still ongoing as new DNA techniques are discovered. One particular case sticks out for Sampson: a Belgian man who died during the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. His parents were elderly, and while they knew that he had died, without official scientific confirmation, they could not get closure. His remains had not been identified. They were afraid they would pass away never having his death confirmed. Two years ago, Sampsonâ€™s office was able to identify the Belgian manâ€™s remains through DNA analysis. â€œI had the honor of telling them we had found their son. That was one of the most incredible experiences of my life,â€\\x9d she says. Thirteen years after 9/11, the parents could finally put their son to rest. For Aglae Charlot, an elegant senior medical examiner with a pronounced French accent who has worked at the office since 1987, it was a teenage girl who came in a few years back. The girl died in the hospital of an unusual illness, from which her mother also suffered. The illness can be idiopathic or caused by Aids. The hospital had assumed it was idiopathic since the mother had the same illness. When Charlot investigated, she found the teenager did actually have Aids, which she must have been suffering from for five or six years. Upon further investigation, she discovered the motherâ€™s boyfriend had died of Aids. Infecting a child and causing her death is murder, she explains to me, her jaw tensing. Charlot knew she could probably trace the particular strain of Aids back to the boyfriend, but what would it change? He was dead, so could not be charged, and it would only cause more pain for the living. She put Aids as the cause of death on the certificate, and left it at that. Seeing the lighter side â€œWe all have an odd sense of humor,â€\\x9d says Christopher Borck, a bearded young medical examiner sitting in front of a file cabinet covered by photos of his wife and two young children. â€œWe are often smiling, and I think you have to when you are surrounded by this every day.â€\\x9d In Hammersâ€™s office, her crooked playfulness is on display in a framed, fake blood-spattered sign above her desk that reads: â€œBraainns.â€\\x9d Humor can provide a release in an environment that is fraught with stress. â€œOne of the things a lot of people donâ€™t realize is that we deal with the living just as much as we deal with the dead,â€\\x9d says Borck. â€œWe provide answers to families.â€\\x9d Much of the week is spent performing autopsies, and the rest of it filling out paperwork, testifying in court and speaking with the families of the dead. At a time when primary care physicians rarely have more than two minutes to speak with a living patient, itâ€™s strange somehow that the medical examiners can spend hours explaining their findings to the families, comforting them and helping them deal with their grief. â€œEvery family really wants to know what happened to their loved one and have their questions answered in order to have closure,â€\\x9d says Hammers. â€œEven if it is a hard answer like in the case of a suicide, it wouldnâ€™t be what they prefer to hear but it allows them to have an answer and then work their grief around that and move through it.â€\\x9d As Borck puts it, when it comes to the deceased: â€œWe are their last physicians.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Malcolm Turnbull welcomes Trump plans for military buildup in Asia-Pacific Malcolm Turnbull has publicly endorsed the proposed US military buildup in the Asia-Pacific region which has been flagged by the incoming Trump administration, while launching a swingeing political attack on the federal opposition, alleging Labor is hopelessly split on the alliance. Asked on Wednesday whether he was at all concerned about talk in the US about the deployment of a giant US military force to counter China in the region, the Australian prime minister was unequivocal. He told reporters â€œa stronger United States means a safer worldâ€\\x9d. The reported last week two senior Trump advisers had flagged the incoming administrationâ€™s desire to expand the US navy from 274 ships to 350 and to deploy more extensively in the region to counter Chinaâ€™s growing assertiveness. This talk has only gathered pace post-election, with public commentary over the past 24 hours from Rudy Giuliani, who is considered the frontrunner to be the new US secretary of state, about the proposed buildup. Giuliani reportedly told a business conference China would not be able to match the US in the Pacific if the navy increased to 350 vessels. â€œIf you face them with a military that is modern, gigantic, overwhelming and unbelievably good at conventional and asymmetric warfare, [China] may challenge it, but I doubt it,â€\\x9d Giuliani is reported to have said. Donald Trump also flagged his intentions during a 15-minute conversation with Turnbull immediately after his election. A more assertive US military posture in the region will likely inflame underlying tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have flared in the flashpoint of the South China Sea. On Wednesday Turnbull appeared sanguine about the development, telling reporters in Canberra Trump had â€œcampaigned on a promise to increase investment in the US military and we support and welcome a strong United Statesâ€\\x9d. â€œA stronger United States means a safer world,â€\\x9d he said. Turnbull also doubled down on domestic politics, declaring Labor was split on the US alliance after the shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, said on Tuesday that Australia was at a â€œchange pointâ€\\x9d in the bilateral relationship after the election of Trump. The prime minister declared that Wong wanted to cut ties with Washington, and â€œto move away from our most trusted, most enduring ally, move away, put our country at riskâ€\\x9d. In a column published Tuesday, Wong did not argue that Australia should abandon the postwar alliance, but she said post-Trump: â€œWe are at a change point, and face the possibility of a very different world and a very different America.â€\\x9d â€œOur collective task now is to carefully and dispassionately consider Australiaâ€™s foreign policy and global interests over coming months, and how best to effect these within the alliance framework.â€\\x9d Wong also argued Australia needed a better roadmap in Asia. Turnbull told reporters the Labor left had always been uncomfortable with the US alliance, and he contended commentary from Labor about the alliance was a distraction from internal divisions on national security and border protection. He pointed to separate commentary from the shadow defence minister, Richard Marles, who argued during a Sky News interview that it was important to have increased US presence in the region. Turnbull suggested the right faction, of which Marles is a member, was attempting to â€œcrab walkâ€\\x9d away from the Wong position. In Mackay the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who has been critical of Trumpâ€™s policy positions, said he was optimistic about the future of the alliance. â€œWe have shared values with the United States but weâ€™re not exactly the same as the United States, so when people talk about the future of the American alliance, Iâ€™m optimistic about it, but that doesnâ€™t mean that we shouldnâ€™t also be engaging in Asia,â€\\x9d Shorten said. â€œLaborâ€™s always had three pillars to our foreign policy and nothingâ€™s changed: One is the American alliance, two is deeper engagement in our region, and three is respect for multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and international forums which deal with a whole range of important issues which effect the globe.â€\\x9d As well as giving succour to Trumpâ€™s plans for the military buildup, the prime minister also on Wednesday gave a tacit endorsement to a criticism Trump made repeatedly during the presidential campaign about allies failing to contribute to the costs of their own defence. During the campaign, Trump suggested that key players in the Asia-Pacific region, like Japan and South Korea, needed to fund their own defence. On Wednesday Turnbull said: â€œI think the United States is entitled to expect its allies to make a commitment, a significant commitment, to their own defence and to that partnership, and Australia does.â€\\x9d â€œNo one can suggest that my government is not absolutely committed to ensuring that the men and women of the ADF have the capabilities, have the resources, to keep our nation safe.â€\\x9d Earlier in the day the defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, noted that Australia pulled its weight in the alliance in terms of military spending. â€œFortunately we are not strategic bludgers because we are at 2% of gross domestic product,â€\\x9d Pyne said at a submarine event. â€œGiven the spend of the Turnbull government into the next 10 years, I would imagine that will be surpassed at some stage in the future. So we are one of the countries that is pulling our weight.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  '-backed Johnâ€™s Campaign wins support from NHS A significant milestone has been reached by Johnâ€™s Campaign, the rapidly growing project to break down institutionalised barriers in the NHS and allow carers of people with dementia who are admitted to hospital to be able to stay with them or visit them at any time. The campaign has been officially endorsed by NHS England in its newly published Commissioning for Quality and Innovation payment framework. It means a humanising change to the way hospitals respond to admissions of people with dementia â€“ who currently occupy one in four hospital beds. From April, financial rewards will be available to healthcare providers who apply the principles espoused by Johnâ€™s Campaign, which began after a powerful response by readers to an article written in 2014 by the novelist Nicci Gerrard. The piece followed the death of her father, Dr John Gerrard, who had been living well with Alzheimerâ€™s until his admission to hospital for an unrelated condition earlier in the year. During his five-week stay, visits from his family had been severely restricted by hospital policy and his decline was catastrophic and irreversible. The public response to the feature made Gerrard and co-founder Julia Jones aware of the scale of the problem and they began Johnâ€™s Campaign on 30 November 2014. There are more than 850,000 people in the UK living with dementia and as a group their experience of stays in hospital is significantly worse than other people of the same age. Julia Jonesâ€™s 92-year-old mother, June, lives with Alzheimerâ€™s and vascular dementia, and the idea of an unsupported hospital admission for her is, said Julia, as unthinkable as it would be to expect a young child to cope alone in hospital. The campaign has had an enthusiastic response from its earliest days and to date 250 hospitals across the UK have pledged to welcome carers of people with dementia whenever the patient needs them. The campaigners are pushing to have this policy embedded nationwide. The action by NHS England has significantly moved the campaign forward by making the adoption of Johnâ€™s Campaign one of the official choices available to clinical commissioning groups across the country from April. Alistair Burns, the national clinical director for dementia and mental health in older people with NHS England, said: â€œWe would encourage hospital trusts, as part of the care they provide to individuals with dementia and their families, to consider facilitating an approach whereby the families and carers of people with dementia can support them fully while they are in hospital.â€\\x9d Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for England, was an early backer of Johnâ€™s Campaign, calling it â€œpractical, achievable and representing positive practice in terms of delivering truly person-centred care for people with dementiaâ€\\x9d. â€œWe agree that there should be open visiting rules for the carers of people with dementia,â€\\x9d she said, â€œAnd the evidence has shown that this is good for patients, good for carers and good for NHS staff.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Mighty mouse: how Disney has dominated the 2016 box office So far this year, Disneyâ€™s releases have racked up nearly $2bn in domestic grosses, twice those of its closest competitor, 20th Century Fox, according to data from BoxOffice Mojo. (Those figures include ticket sales from films that opened in 2015 but were still playing in theaters into this year.) Underscoring its dominance, Disney boasts four out of the five top-grossing films to date this year, in Finding Dory ($426m), Captain America: Civil War ($406m), The Jungle Book ($360m) and Zootopia ($341m). Thatâ€™s just in the US; worldwide, those four films together have taken in more than $3.75bn. Disneyâ€™s hot streak could be chalked up to the random nature of the movie business, in which studiosâ€™ fortunes tend to rise and fall from year to year. Consider that last year Universal dominated the scene mainly on the strength of a surprise mega-movie â€“ Jurassic World, which grossed $1.7bn globally. Without a Jurassic sequel due until 2018, Universal is now languishing behind Disney, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros, with $603m in domestic ticket sales. That accounts for about 10% market share this year compared with almost a third for Disney. But with The Secret Life of Pets grossing more than $100m in its opening weekend, Universal looks to be back in the game. Thereâ€™s more to Disneyâ€™s surge this year, however, than just a fortuitous run. Its impressive box office performance is the culmination of its three big film acquisitions over the last decade: Pixar, Marvel and, most recently, Lucasfilm. With the successful reboot of the Star Wars franchise last December, Disney now has all three of its key theatrical properties â€“ animated features, Marvel and Star Wars â€“ going full throttle at the same time. Call it the companyâ€™s version of Murderersâ€™ Row. â€œ[Disneyâ€™s] acquisitions in the last couple of years have really panned out for them â€“Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar â€“ and thatâ€™s why weâ€™re seeing such strong numbers,â€\\x9d said Daniel LorÃ\\xada, editorial director for Boxoffice Media. â€œAny studio in town would be happy to have just one of them.â€\\x9d The studio-owning conglomerates competing with Disney arenâ€™t just in awe. Comcastâ€™s NBCUniversal division in April acquired DreamWorks Animation, best known for movies like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, for $3.8bn. â€œCompetitors recognize that content is crucial in order to operate,â€\\x9d noted Michael Mazzeo, an associate professor of strategy at Northwesternâ€™s Kellogg School of Management who has studied Disney. â€œBut other companies have to be careful of not just getting the leftovers.â€\\x9d Blue-chip franchises donâ€™t come cheap. Disney bought Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm for a combined total of about $15.5bn. â€œThey paid really high price tags for those studios,â€\\x9d said Mazzeo, noting it will still be years before Disney fully recoups its investment. That payoff comes not just in the form of box office receipts, of course, but through the full range of Disneyâ€™s business operations â€“ DVD sales, merchandising, theme parks, resorts and the like, stemming from its movies, characters and other content. â€œSimilar to the animated franchises, Disney arranged the Marvel Universe to create a series of interconnected films and product tie-ins. With the acquisition of Lucasfilm, Disney appears to be positioning the Star Wars franchise in the same manner,â€\\x9d wrote Morningstar equity analyst Neil Macker, in a May research note. That isnâ€™t to say every Disney movie is a revenue gusher. Alice Through the Looking Glass, the follow-up to the 2010 hit Alice in Wonderland, flopped, taking in just over $76m to date against a production budget of $170m. The Steven Spielberg-directed BFG, which opened this month, has also disappointed. Last yearâ€™s The Good Dinosaur was a rare dud for Pixar. But the overall depth of Disneyâ€™s lineup more than makes up for the misfires. â€œOnce you have that portfolio, as with finances, you have that balance, so that when one is up and the other is down, that reduces the variance you get,â€\\x9d said Mazzeo. Within animated features, for example, the rejuvenation of Walt Disney Animated Studios in recent years thatâ€™s led to huge hits such as Frozen and Zootopia can help offset the occasional Good Dinosaur. But given Disneyâ€™s increasing reliance on franchise properties, one potential pitfall is that of sequel fatigue. Will audiences simply grow numb to yet another Marvel superheroes-save-the-world extravaganza? LorÃ\\xada argues that as long as quality remains consistent across sequels, people will continue to show up. â€œIf a film is able to connect with an audience, whether itâ€™s a sequel or not, the audience will turn out,â€\\x9d he said. Keep in mind, the next Star Wars film, Rogue One, isnâ€™t strictly a sequel but the first standalone entry in the series. Whether audiences find it an intriguing variation on a theme or a B-version of the real thing wonâ€™t be known until its scheduled opening in November. But if the response is anything like that to The Force Awakens, it could cap a blowout box office year for Disney.',\n",
              "  'This is not Labour MPs vs Corbyn. Theyâ€™re at war with party members A swirling red mist has descended over the eyes of many Labour MPs. It is a mist that makes them blind to how their activities look to the world outside the Westminster village. If they donâ€™t like Jeremy Corbyn (and despite their protestations to the contrary they give every appearance of not doing so) then they always had the option of a leadership challenge under the rule book. It could have been conducted in an orderly, perhaps low-key fashion, at least until parliament went into recess in just three weeksâ€™ time. The aim would have been to try to concentrate on bringing the country together in a time of great peril after the Brexit vote. And it would have been important in these early days for the entire parliamentary party to focus on holding the Tories to account. Instead Labour MPs chose to stage a blood-stained three-ring circus. Instead of putting their energies into fighting the Tories, colleagues have been concentrating on orchestrating waves of MPs â€“ whom no one has ever heard of â€“ into resigning from jobs that nobody knew they had. Colleagues could have been providing leadership against the resurgent racism that so many of their constituents are terrified by. Instead Labour MPs have spent time in huddles with their fellow inhabitants of the Westminster bubble, lobby correspondents. These journalists, supposed political experts, did not see the Jeremy Corbyn phenomenon coming last summer and have never supported him. Accordingly they are now using their columns to tell him to walk away. Colleagues have contrived a â€œvote of no confidenceâ€\\x9d that has absolutely no basis in the rule book. There was no notice. It was tabled on Monday and the vote held the following day. No institution would run an important ballot in this way. And it was a secret ballot. All this was necessary because some Labour MPs expressly did not want any time to consult with ordinary party members. On the contrary they were terrified that their members might actually find out how they voted. Hence the haste and the secrecy. But the climax of all this was Mondayâ€™s parliamentary Labour party (PLP) meeting. MP after MP got up to attack Jeremy Corbyn in the most contemptuous terms possible, pausing only to text their abuse to journalists waiting outside. A non-Corbynista MP told me afterwards that he had never seen anything so horrible and he had felt himself reduced to tears. Nobody talked about Jeremy Corbynâ€™s politics. There was only one intention: to break him as a man. This attempt to hound Jeremy Corbyn out of the leadership has been planned for months and was entirely outside the rules. Blaming him for the Brexit vote was just a pretext. The truth is that Jeremy travelled thousands of miles mobilising Labour voters. Nearly two-thirds of Labour voted to remain. If David Cameron had been able to persuade a similar proportion of his Tories to vote for remain, we would still be in the EU. But colleagues went for lynch mob tactics because they didnâ€™t actually want a leadership election with Jeremy on the ballot. Their fear is that he will win. Which brings us to the heart of the matter. This is not the PLP versus Jeremy Corbyn; this is the PLP versus the membership. It is the inhabitants of the Westminster bubble versus the ordinary men and women who make up the party in the country. Now, finally, after a hugely destructive attempt to drive Jeremy out of office, his enemies are poised to do what they have struggled to avoid. A formal leadership challenge is imminent. Hopefully the wider Labour party will now begin to leave behind the hysteria that has engulfed the PLP these past few days. Once again party members will be asked what sort of party they want to be and what sort of leadership they want. It can be imagined that they will not look kindly on those who have unleashed the utterly self-serving havoc of the past few days.',\n",

Grant was given a BFI fellowship, following in the footsteps of British actors who include Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Elizabeth Taylor and Sir Michael Caine. The BFI said Grant, with films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, had â€œredefined the British leading man for a generationâ€\\x9d. Its chairman, Greg Dyke, said: â€œWith impeccable comic timing and huge doses of his unique, ironic self-deprecating and very British charm, Hugh always pulls off the hardest thing of all â€“ a seemingly effortless performance. I can assure you itâ€™s not. â€œHughâ€™s acting talents are prodigious and his contribution to cinema enormous. He is a British icon and has been making literally billions of people all over the world laugh, cry â€“ and fall in love with him of course â€“ for over 30 years.â€\\x9d Grant often plays down his talents as an actor and his response to the award was modest: â€œThis is such a lovely surprise,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAnd a great honour and Iâ€™m very grateful to the BFI for thinking of me.â€\\x9d The fellowship was presented at a dinner in London by the film producer and co-chairman of Working Title, Eric Fellner. He said: â€œHugh is one of those extraordinary British actors whose effortless performance and onscreen charm has endeared him to generations of audiences worldwide. â€œHis success has helped British film as a whole carve out a place in the world with a distinct quality that easily rivals the best to come out of Hollywood and other countries. For that contribution alone he deserves this remarkable honour from the BFI.â€\\x9d Grantâ€™s first major film role was, for some, one of his finest, as the handsome upper-class Englishman repressing his homosexuality in Maurice. That won him a best actor award at the Venice film festival, shared with James Wilby, who played the title role. He went on to star in Ken Russellâ€™s Lair of the White Worm, Roman Polanskiâ€™s Bitter Moon and then, in 1994, his breakthrough role in Mike Newellâ€™s Four Weddings and a Funeral. There have been some duds â€“ Did You Hear About the Morgans? â€“ but there has also been the two Bridget Jones movies and About a Boy. He will next be seen alongside Meryl Streep in Stephen Frearsâ€™ film about a deluded opera singer, Florence Foster Jenkins. More recently Grant has been vocal in his anger over phone hacking, appearing as a witness at the Leveson inquiry.',\n",

The Chilean artist Alfredo Jaarâ€™s billboard, named A Logo for America, was first shown in New Yorkâ€™s Times Square in 1987, and was remounted there in 2014. This summer, it will flash above Londonâ€™s Piccadilly Circus, courtesy of the South London Gallery, as part of its exhibition of contemporary Latin American art called Under the Same Sun. Jaarâ€™s artwork was doubtless pertinent in 1987, but now this neon message is truly electric. When Jaar created the original billboard, the relationship between the US and Latin America was a bubbling political and cultural issue. Today, that issue has reached a boiling point â€“ becoming a hot excuse for hatred and bigotry, fear and loathing â€“ as extreme nationalism and xenophobia are injected into the nationâ€™s bloodstream by Donald Trump. For Trump, this IS America â€“ and he wants to build a wall to keep it that way. Jaarâ€™s work turns Trumpâ€™s rhetoric upside down. Who is Trump kidding? This really isnâ€™t America. It stopped being so some time ago, and a wall wonâ€™t reverse history. What happens when his inhumane doctrines fail? Does a state that starts down a foul racist road reverse into liberalism when things donâ€™t work out as promised â€“ or does it accelerate towards fascism? A Logo for America turns RenÃ© Magritteâ€™s philosophical painting This Is Not a Pipe into a political provocation. The United States is not America, because America is a continent, not a single nation. That continent contains many Americas and many kinds of Americans. Rio de Janeiro is as American as apple pie. But Jaarâ€™s statement is true in another way. As a Chilean artist based in New York, he is part of a new melting pot of the Americas, the wondrous and inevitable convergence of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking America with Anglophone US, which cannot be reversed within any decent parameters of democratic government. More than 17% of the US population identifies as Hispanic or Latino. Spanish is the countryâ€™s second most-spoken language. This creates rich and complex cultural connections between the country that calls itself America and the American continent it is part of. It is not outrageous for Jaar to point out the fiction that America means just the US. What is shocking is Trumpâ€™s declaration of war on the rest of the continent. Liberals â€“ and sane conservatives, for that matter â€“ are still reeling from the monstrosity of Trumpâ€™s plan to build a wall between the US and Mexico. The truly frightening detail of his published plans is his policy of â€œcompelling Mexico to pay for the wallâ€\\x9d, a highly aggressive idea to blackmail Mexico into funding the venture. This does not resemble a reasonable democratic process; it is a series of ultimatums and deadlines. No one who has studied any history can fail to recognise the similarity to the kinds of ultimatums Germany issued in the 1930s. The United States is a big, generous country with lots to be proud of, and hospitality is its greatest virtue of all. Can the â€œAmericaâ€\\x9d that has engraved under its Statue of Liberty â€œgive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe freeâ€\\x9d really elect Trump as president?

Thatâ€™s likeâ€¦ 16 walls.â€\\x9d This relentlessly self-referential antihero romp comes on like a slightly smug corporate riposte to Matthew Vaughnâ€™s altogether more anarchic Kick-Ass, flipping the bird at its own heritage (the opening titles tell us that itâ€™s produced by â€œAss-hatsâ€\\x9d and directed by â€œan overpaid toolâ€\\x9d) and cracking wise about how confusing these comic-strip timelines have become, and the cheapskate nature of the ever-expanding X-Men universe. Ryan Reynolds is the potty-mouthed avenger whose life is ruined when enforced mutation robs him of his Hugo Boss chops, leaving him looking â€œlike Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utahâ€\\x9d. Limb-lopping sweary ultra-violence ensues, offering a fairly consistent stream of dirty cheap laughs as Deadpool gets rear-ended by bullets and butt-plugs alike, while those around him lose their hearts and heads â€“ but mostly their heads. Inevitably the final act descends into the usual punchy/smashy orgy of collapsing buildings that is a dreary franchise requirement. But for the most part itâ€™s crudely disreputable fare, buoyed up by ironic bubblegum tunes (a Guantanamo-style torture montage to the strains of Mr Sandman is a nice touch) and driven by Viz-style â€œshit biscuitâ€\\x9d profanity.',\n",
              "  'The view on the economics of Brexit: a fact-based fear Every referendum is in the end a contest between the status quo and a change. It would hardly be worth having such a vote if it were not. Britainâ€™s European Union referendum is certainly such a contest. In this case itâ€™s a choice between the status quo, sticking with the EU, or a change, leaving it. The Scottish referendum two years ago was the same: the status quo of the union or a change in the shape of independence. It follows from this that any referendum is inherently a contest between the risks or rewards of change. Thatâ€™s why it makes no sense to dismiss a defence of the status quo â€“ remaining in the EU in the current case â€“ as simply a Project Fear. This is an effective insult to throw at defenders of the status quo â€“ as happened in Scotland â€“ but ultimately an insult is all that it is. Defenders of the status quo are bound to emphasise the risk of change as part of their case. Sometimes it shows good judgment to warn. Sometimes it is wise, sensible and responsible to remind people to be fearful. Sometimes those who scream about Project Fear at every turn prove only that they are in denial about reality. Two months before polling day, and with public opinion too evenly divided for comfort, Britainâ€™s EU referendum has now reached such a point. It is time to get serious about defending Britainâ€™s place in Europe. There are many positive reasons â€“ prominent among them strength in numbers, shared values, mutual protection and avoidance of war â€“ why Britain should remain in the EU. They are a fundamental part of the case for remaining. They could and should help make an essential and inspiring case. But there are also a lot of real dangers to leaving, and these dangers need to be voiced loudly, repeatedly and without apology too. The Treasury is entirely right to make those dangers as clear as it can. It would be failing in its task if it did anything else. On Monday it published a very substantial assessment of the long-term economic impact of the different courses on which Britain will vote on 23 June. The bottom line is simply that Britain will be very significantly worse off as a country if it leaves the EU. The Treasury assessment concludes that economic slowdown following a Brexit and a new trading relationship with Europe would amount to the loss of Â£36bn in tax receipts. To recoup that would require an 8p rise on the basic rate of income tax or a 7p rise in VAT. Some of the figures in the Treasury document, those that relate to the state of the economy in 15 or 20 years, will prove to be wrong. But the general picture allows no get-out. Britain will be worse off leaving Europe. Short-term dislocation and long-term damage would be inevitable consequences. And those at the bottom of the economic ladder would suffer them most. It wonâ€™t do to dismiss the assessment as deeply flawed, as the leave campaign did on Monday, let alone to call such warnings â€œbaloneyâ€\\x9d as Londonâ€™s mayor did in March. Responses of this sort are not serious. But they are the ones the leave campaign always prefers. The leavers seem incapable of saying in practical terms what their vision for Brexit Britain would look like or how it would add up in figures that can be tested. The Treasuryâ€™s assessment is in line with other assessments made here or abroad. It is not scaremongering. It is a reality check. British voters have every reason to be fearful of what the leave campaign would inflict on them.',\n",

For reasons I still do not fully grasp, I once reviewed a woollen ball. I reviewed pegs. Sodding clothes pegs. And yet... this. This is the lowest Iâ€™ve sunk on behalf of this feature. Rifling through bins. Here is an image of the contents I uncovered: Here is my review of those contents: The wrapper: I donâ€™t know what this wrapper is for because finding out would mean touching it. It looks crisp, clear and presumably wrapped whatever it was wrapping ably. The tissue: I do know what these tissues are for because I put them in there roughly half an hour before this photograph was taken. The tissues were soft â€“ Sainsburyâ€™s Super Soft Aloe Vera, if memory serves â€“ and smelled very fine indeed. A second wrapper (to left of image): Bananas. This definitely contained bananas. Technically, bananas already come bunched and encased within natural wrappers, so this artificial wrapper seems slightly unnecessary. I would like to add a final note: the bin I reviewed had been emptied fairly recently. Yet more proof that the â€™s superlative facilities department is second to none, but not exactly conducive to a thrilling review. The binâ€™s contents: 4/10 The â€™s facilities department: 10/10 LH Computer games based on pop stars The final clause of this suggestion is music to any time-pressed anything-reviewerâ€™s ears, and Iâ€™m no exception. Conducting a comprehensive survey of â€œcomputer games based on pop starsâ€\\x9d would be an actual journalistic enterprise that could potentially involve time and/or effort, so thank God I only had to look at about six pictures before extrapolating some intrinsically worthless judgment. (There was a YouTube video of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood game, but the amount of information contained therein was clearly not just superfluous, but actively contrary to Whitlock & Popeâ€™s requirements. So thatâ€™s 22 minutes of my life I still have today.) You might think the more information you have, the easier it is to review anything: not so. In fact, information often complicates the reductive summaries every reviewer longs to write. So what observations can I make about computer games based on pop stars using the limited materials I have at my disposal? Well, the pixels are relatively large. Sometimes they are brightly coloured, sometimes they arenâ€™t. Granted, attributing any sort of value to these observations is not that easy, but thatâ€™s why we employ a numerical system! 4/10 RA A chunk of yesterday afternoon 16.24 and all is well 16.25 I think I get a fav on a tweet about how much I hate cars.

Elba backs my team to lose at home against Sunderland on Saturday. I make a mental black mark against his name. 16.41 I start thinking about Corbyn: The Musical, which sounds like a load of self-satisfied rubbish and was written by a barrister with the face of a Victorian pie lover. Itâ€™s apparently full of cheap jokes at both the Labour leaderâ€™s expense and also, for some reason, prominent twitter feminists. I wonder what made the pie lover feel it was necessary to bring this to the world. 16.48 I google some quotes from The Big Lebowski. 16.53 I think a bit about giraffes and how sticky their tongues are.

              "  'If the City has truly found humility, it can still be useful to Britain The City is in a panic. Executives at the big banks, insurers and consultancies are stressing over the implications of something they never expected to happen. There is a frayed anxiety underlying all their conversations, even though they talk about the trapdoor marked Brexit not opening for at least two years and possibly longer (some still believe it will never happen). Brexit gives Europe a chance to wrest away some of the financial functions provided by London. Worse, outside the EU, London could face extra competition from centres closer to the global centre of economic gravity, like Singapore and Hong Kong. At an event last week staged by the lobbying organisation TheCityUK, senior figures in the industry attempted to help their peers figure out what they might do next. Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, had a warning for his colleagues: refrain from lobbying for the industryâ€™s sectional interests; be very discreet; and be seen to be batting for Britain, not the City. David Sproul, boss of the accountancy firm Deloitteâ€™s, went further. He said the City had overplayed its hand during the recovery, leaving behind people in towns like Sunderland and Hartlepool. Deloitte has apprentices with A-levels from some of the poorest districts in the country, he said, but the firmâ€™s welcoming hand stretches only as far as London boroughs like Newham. The north-east was, he confessed, off its radar. Flint made a further stab at appearing contrite. Voters, he said, had rejected what he termed the â€œexpert classâ€\\x9d, referring to the widely reported jibe made by Tory leadership candidate Michael Gove. And bankers should welcome the stringent regulations of the post-crash world, drop their objections and accept it as the price of stability and citizen consent. Does that mean he told his pub mates the price of remaining in the EU was keeping the 50p tax rate, embracing the Vickers review and living a less ostentatious life? Possibly. He certainly said City folk needed to pay themselves less and workers more to assuage the resentment that he failed to recognise, but which was obvious for all to see before the referendum vote. And that must be the question for the City and to a great extent the nation, which has come to depend heavily on the financial services industry for jobs, tax revenue and especially foreign income. How can it prosper, moderate its risky behaviour and keep people in Stoke-on-Trent from using their democratic vote to poison the well, killing the banks and themselves at the same time? Painful though it is to think of, for the time being the economy needs the financial services industry. Some of the figures that illustrate its importance to Britain are startling. Together with the professional services firms that feed off the banks and insurers, the industry employs more than 7% of the UK workforce, producing nearly 12% of total economic output, and contributing 11% of tax revenues. Most importantly, the industry generates a trade surplus of Â£72bn a year. This surplus goes to close the gap created by an enormous deficit in imported goods, and a steep decline in Britainâ€™s investment income from abroad in the last few years. Bank of England governor Mark Carney constantly battles those who believe the banks will cost more to save than they will ever generate for the economy. He was at pains last week to reassure the nation that the current swings in financial markets and the tumbling value of the pound were within the limits of the regulatorsâ€™ capabilities. His backstop of Â£250bn, which he stands ready to pump into the markets if suddenly everyone wants to sell and nobody wants to buy, would be enough, along with all the capital reserves available to banks, to protect us from another crash, he said. Everyone wants to believe he is right. However, itâ€™s just a tactical issue when the real problem is a strategic one â€“ a problem that relates to Flintâ€™s thoughts on finding a way to a more profitable but safer banking system. It is, of course, a circle that cannot be squared in Flintâ€™s myopic worldview. Banks need to take risks if they are to recapture even half the 25% return on equity they enjoyed before 2008. At the moment it is 9%. But thatâ€™s impossible when there are trillions of dollars of savings chasing only a handful of investment opportunities. Tougher regulation of banks has only pushed the risky behaviour into other areas of the financial system. The Bank for International Settlements â€“ known as the central bank of central bankers â€“ has warned that a â€œrisky trinityâ€\\x9d of threats hangs over the financial system, including the huge amount of debt taken on by asset managers, pension funds and others away from the banking system. Anastasia Nesvetailova, the director of the Political Economy Research Centre at City University, argues this debt mountain is so large that if it collapses, engulfing the financial system, it will cause a depression worse than the one experienced in 2008. George Osborneâ€™s decision to relax his fiscal rules could allow for higher government borrowing and greater public investment. This is a policy that Flint and his City colleagues must embrace. Unfortunately, the logic of safer borrowing by governments, as we move to a more sustainable balance of debt to spending, is at odds with their neoliberal ideology.',\n",
              "  'The web startups looking to cash in on 1 billion African consumers It is a cliched image. Passengers lined up at the check-in desk for various flights back to African capitals, trolleys overloaded and suitcases straining at the weight limit. It reflects a reality of tough customs and import regimes, complex markets and challenging distribution networks that often leave only the lucky few with the means to travel to Europe, the US, the Gulf or other destinations where they are able to buy â€“ and take home â€“ the consumer goods they need or want. But this is beginning to change. The continentâ€™s potential customer base of more than 1 billion, combined with an emerging middle class, has attracted investors to African retail. While the vast majority of trade still occurs through informal transactions in corner shops, and to a lesser degree in shopping malls, there is a slow, steady shift from offline to online. For Jumia Group (until recently known as Africa Internet Group), the continentâ€™s first unicorn â€“ a private tech startup with a valuation of over $1bn â€“ tapping into Africaâ€™s e-commerce potential is central to its business model. â€œWe sell genuine branded products to the growing middle classes in each of the markets that we serve,â€\\x9d said Sam Chappatte, the managing director of Jumia Kenya. â€œWe want to provide the online shopping experience and quality products to everyone with an internet connection and disposable income.â€\\x9d The French insurer Axa paid â‚¬75m for a stake in the company in February; other investors include Goldman Sachs, South Africaâ€™s MTN Group and Rocket Internet from Germany. Its offerings include classifieds, food delivery, travel and real estate websites â€“ all of which have been renamed in the recent rebranding â€“ but its online retail arm, Jumia, has been perhaps its most recognisable. With an interface familiar to users of Amazon, Jumia acts as a marketplace for electronics, clothing, household items and more. It launched in Nigeria in 2012 and was recently named as one of the worldâ€™s top 50 smartest companies by MIT. Jumia is present in 11 countries across the continent, supplying brands and products that consumers often cannot otherwise access locally, with the added benefit of convenience. â€œOrdering online saves people time and effort. There are always issues of traffic, or when you get there you find that the retailer is out of stock of the product you want. And there are still doubts around authenticity,â€\\x9d said Chappatte. â€œWe have a big focus on trust. We have teams that spend their days screening the products that come on to our site.â€\\x9d Jumia makes thousands of deliveries a day in Nigeria alone, and in the first nine months of 2015 recorded a transaction volume of â‚¬206m, a 265% increase on the previous year. It is one of the largest e-commerce enterprises operating in Africa, all of which are seeking to tap into the continentâ€™s growing consumer market. A McKinsey Global Institute report published in 2013 suggested that e-commerce could account for 10% of retail sales â€“ or $75bn â€“ in Africaâ€™s largest economies by 2025. Elsewhere, major websites â€“ such as Cheki in Kenya, Zimbabwe and beyond, and bidorbuy in South Africa â€“ sell new and used cars, deliver groceries and prepared food, or offer eBay-style marketplaces. The bigger they grow, the more local entrepreneurs and small businesses can connect with a wide customer base. But e-commerce remains a challenging space. The absence of formal addresses in most African countries means that more time and effort is spent locating customers. A preference for cash on delivery payments in many countries â€“ due to low credit card penetration and anxieties around fraud â€“ leaves delivery drivers handling and carrying large sums of money. A limited pool of talent and funding also causes drag on the sector. Multiple barriers hinder the development of cross-border e-commerce â€“ including poor infrastructure, underdeveloped logistics and difficulties with international bank transactions. â€œJumia has been very successful at fundraising and it is a real success story, but it needs to move to a sustainable business model,â€\\x9d said Manuel Koser, founding partner at Silvertree Capital, and who used to work with Jumia. â€œIs it successful in terms of return on capital? Itâ€™s so far so good with Jumia, but itâ€™s not a finished success story.â€\\x9d And, as Chappatte acknowledged, the obvious limitation to all e-commerce initiatives is â€œpeople having an internet connectionâ€\\x9d. Jumiaâ€™s response to this has been to launch its J-Force service, which works to bring off-data consumers into the online ordering space by using agents. These agents act like mini ordering and delivery hubs, earning commission in the process. â€œWeâ€™re betting on a channel shift from offline to online,â€\\x9d said Koser, whose firm typically invests in the online and mobile sector. Despite the obstacles, with Africaâ€™s digital divide narrowing, many agree it is a smart bet.',\n",
              "  'The online tool that helps the public decode health research Health concerns every one of us. We all have questions about the impact of factors such as lifestyle and diet on our wellbeing. Yet for all our collective curiosity, it is immensely difficult to sift through the mountain of claims and counter-claims weâ€™re exposed to each day. We are bombarded with declarations about our health and wellbeing, and frequently these assertions are conflicting. Sorting the signal from the noise is no small task. Traditionally, part of the problem has been access to information. Scientific journals charge for access to research papers, and the cost can be prohibitive to anyone - including researchers - bar institutional libraries . This has improved rapidly over recent years, with many research councils and funding bodies pushing towards open-access publishing, encouraging researchers to ensure their findings are made freely accessible to the public. This is hugely beneficial, but access is only half the battle. The vital issue of appraising medical findings still remains rather daunting for most of us. The reality is that studies can be notoriously difficult to decode in isolation. The mere fact a study exists showing a particular result is not in itself evidence that result is robust or true. It is crucial to be aware that not all studies are created equal, and some are much higher quality than others. This is a particular concern in the medical field, where confounding factors frequently skew conclusions. For example, studies with only a small number of participants are often statistically underpowered, and results from these might give a misleading picture of reality . Even with an adequate sample size, it can be difficult to distinguish causal relationships from mere correlation, and lurking variables or poor study design can throw out an entire analysis. Apparently conflicting findings can also occur, rendering a studyâ€™s conclusions ambiguous to a general audience, and making it difficult to draw inference with any certainty. Addressing the difficulties in interpreting research results has therefore been a driving motivation for a project undertaken by the Medical Research Council/Chief Scientist Office Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow (MRC/CSO SPHSU) at University of Glasgow. The result is Understanding Health Research (UHR), a free service created with the intention of helping people better understand health research in context. Essentially, UHR it functions as an interactive field-guide to evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of any given health paper. In addition, it gives clear and understandable explanations of important considerations like sampling, bias, uncertainty and replicability. This has the potential to be invaluable for improving public understanding of science and ultimately to improving our collective well-being. After all, as Dr Shona Hilton, deputy director of MRC/CSO SPHSU says â€œwithout the tools to assess contradictory health messages and claims about new discoveries and treatments, the public are vulnerable to false hope, emotional distress, financial exploitation and serious health risks.â€\\x9d This is all too true. As Shakespeare pointed out â€œthe devil can cite Scripture for his purposeâ€\\x9d, and this remains especially true in health science, where misguided or unscrupulous operators can hide behind a veneer of science disguising dubious ideas or therapies. It is hoped that tools such as UHR will help the general public differentiate between high and low quality evidence. A dark example of the need for UHR is the panic over the MMR vaccine, which was partly based on what turned out to be a weak study published in the Lancet. The ensuing panic lowered vaccination rates and fuelled a persistent on-going crusade against vaccines. Over a decade later we are still haunted by the spectre of frequent measles outbreaks worldwide, many of which trace their lineage back to this debacle. Of course, science is inherently complex and findings often shaded with nuance, so no one tool can ever be expected to serve as a surrogate for expertise. Rather, UHR serves as an excellent place to start an investigation, giving people the ability to roughly assess how much stock they might place in a health finding or media story. In this era of rapidly perpetuating misinformation, useful and considered tools like this are a welcome antidote to unabated hyperbole, and a crucial vanguard in the campaign for better understanding of science and health.',\n",
              "  'Leaked child cancer care review points to closure of Royal Marsden unit A leaked review into childrenâ€™s cancer care in London that has remained unpublished for 14 months indicates that the Royal Marsden unit in south-west London which provides such treatment should close. The report recommends that cancer care for children be consolidated at a single principal treatment centre, which according to NHS experts is most likely to be at Great Ormond Street hospital in north London. Dr Andy Mitchell, the medical director of NHS London, requested the report which was submitted in February 2015. But the review, chaired by Mike Stevens, the professor of paediatric oncology at Bristol University, has yet to appear. â€œIt was completed over a year ago and not a lot has happened; heâ€™s very cross. Technically itâ€™s not available,â€\\x9d said an NHS insider. The Stevens review does not come up with explicit recommendations for the location of a single principal treatment centre but health experts say the Royal Marsden is in the firing line. â€œAnyone who knows the subject knows the implications for the Royal Marsden,â€\\x9d said an NHS expert speaking on conditionof anonymity, who noted that one of its problems was that children in its care had to be bussed between the Royal Marsden in Sutton and St Georgeâ€™s in Tooting, also in south-west London. Since 2006, London has two designated principal treatment centres for childrenâ€™s cancer services. Both operate on two sites and between two trusts. The one in north London consists of the Great Ormond Street hospital for children and a second site at University College hospital, seeing an average of 230 new patients each year. The distance between St Georgeâ€™s and Royal Marsden is 7.8 miles, whereas Great Ormond and University College are 1.3 miles apart. The Stevens review says stem cell transplants from another person to children with malignant diseases in London should be only undertaken on one site. Prince William is president of the Royal Marsden â€“ whose main hospital site is in Chelsea, central London â€“ a position previously held by his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. He visited the hospital in September 2011 with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, to open the Oak Centre of Children and Young People, where children are treated for cancer, their first public engagement in the UK after their marriage. It sees about 180 new patients a year. NHS London commissioned the review in August 2014 amid longstanding concerns over the fragmentation of the treatment of childrenâ€™s cancer in the capital. Elsewhere, the trend has been treatment at one site. The report followed a previous review published in May 2011 by the national clinical advisory team, triggered by the death of a child in 2009 who initially received treatment at the Royal Marsden but critical care at St Georgeâ€™s. The child died in December 2009 at St Georgeâ€™s, where he was admitted for febrile neutropenia. The Royal Marsden provided oncology services and radiotherapy for children with cancer while St Georgeâ€™s provided critical care services. Some of the short-term recommendations were implemented but no progress was made in delivering the longer aim of relocating the main treatment centre to one site, says the review. It outlines five options ranging from sticking to the status quo, to an increase in the number of principal treatment centres. But it comes down firmly in favour of one centre located at a single site with all necessary paediatric services â€“ option three. â€œThe review panel sees option three as the more visionary alternative and, subject to the necessary investment, carefully managed implementation and strong clinical leadership, believe this offers substantial potential for the delivery of the world-class service deserved by the children of London,â€\\x9d says the review. Cally Palmer, the chief executive of the Royal Marsden, which could ultimately lose out if the one centre is backed, is also the national director for cancer at NHS England, which commissioned the still unpublished report. An NHS England London spokesperson said: â€œChildrenâ€™s cancer services are generally of a very high standard, and survival rates are now the highest theyâ€™ve ever been. There are good clinical arguments for ensuring cancer specialist services are co-located as they currently are, just as there are alternative views about combining childrenâ€™s services regardless of specialty discipline. â€œThese are not black and white judgments and itâ€™s important we take the time to get any future planning right. A report commissioned on this will be one input into this debate.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'SalomÃ³n RondÃ³n denies Stoke first win with late equaliser for West Brom A first league victory of the season for Stoke was the only milestone that mattered to Mark Hughes on a day when Tony Pulis took charge of a team for the 1,000th time. Stoke looked on course for just that after Joe Allen scored in the 73rd minute. But they did not make it over the line, as SalomÃ³n RondÃ³n headed into their net from a corner in stoppage time. Stoke used to celebrate late goals for Pulisâ€™s team but they cursed this one. â€œIt felt like a loss,â€\\x9d said Hughes, who could take encouragement from a strong performance by his team and the fact that a point was enough to hoist them off the foot of the table. Pulis, who has spent nearly half of his career in the Stoke dugout, was welcomed back warmly to his old patch but Stoke fansâ€™ affections did not extend to the visiting players, whose every touch was booed from the first second. That reflected defiance in the face of Stokeâ€™s poor start to the season and was combined with loud encouragement for the home team. Stokeâ€™s players were similarly upbeat, betraying no sign of disenchantment, just a hunger to quash Albion. It made for a rousing first period in which clear chances were scarce but the threat of a breakthrough was always present. Albion were no bystanders, indeed they fired the first shot. But RondÃ³nâ€™s curler in the sixth minute whizzed wide, meaning that Lee Grant did not have to make his first Premier League save since joining Stoke on loan from Derby County in the summer. The 33-year-old was picked instead of Shay Given as part of Hughesâ€™s plan to solidify a leaky defence. Although RondÃ³n had three more shots off target in the first half, Stoke were on top. Their midfield, with Allen thriving in an advanced role, pestered the visitors relentlessly and, when they won the ball, attacked immediately. In the 25th minute Glenn Whelan pinged a cross to Wilfried Bony, who headed the ball across the six-yard box. Glen Johnson lifted it over the advancing Ben Foster, only for Craig Dawson to head off the line. Twice Eric Pieters fell under untidy tackles by Matt Phillips but no penalties were given. Hughes ran through the full Basil Fawlty routine â€“ in his technical area so as not to incur another fine â€“ but conceded after seeing replays that â€œboth were close calls, in fairnessâ€\\x9d. Early in the second half Allen nearly gave Stoke the goal they craved but Dawson denied them again, deflecting the midfielderâ€™s header over. Bony was the only home player to disappoint, strong in possession but lacking the mobility to be in regular synch with his team-mates. He was replaced on the hour by Peter Crouch. Stoke claimed the reward for their persistence in the 73rd minute when Xherdan Shaqiri crossed from the left and Jonny Evans failed to make a clean clearance owing to a challenge by Marko Arnautovic. Allen shot into the net from eight yards. He was a fitting scorer. â€œ[Allenâ€™s] got good anticipation of things dropping around the box and that showed for the goal,â€\\x9d said Hughes. â€œThatâ€™s why he left Liverpool, because he wanted to play week in, week out and weâ€™ve given him the run of games. Heâ€™s been a shining light for us, heâ€™s been the one hitting the levels we expect.â€\\x9d Grant preserved the lead with a fine save from a header by James McClean but he could not keep out RondÃ³nâ€™s header at the death. So it was yet another happy day at Stoke for Pulis. â€œThe place is wonderful and the crowd were fantastic to me when I was here,â€\\x9d said the Albion manager. â€œItâ€™s been stitched into my body this football club. Iâ€™ll always have respect for them.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Obama to offer his friendly opposition to Brexit during visit to UK Barack Obama will strike a delicate balance over Brexit during a visit to the UK next week, where he will host a town hall with youth and offer his view â€œas a friendâ€\\x9d that Britain should remain in the EU. White House officials suggested on Thursday that the president will only wade into the contentious debate if asked, and reiterated Obamaâ€™s position that the US supports â€œa strong UK in the European Unionâ€\\x9d. â€œHe will make very clear that this is a matter the British people should decide when they head to the polls in June,â€\\x9d Ben Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser, said in a conference call with reporters. â€œWe believe that all of us benefit when the EU can speak with a strong and a single voice and can work with us to advance our shared interests whether on security or prosperity,â€\\x9d he added. â€œWe believe that the UK has benefitted from the single market that is good for the British economy and that, in turn, is good for the United States economy.â€\\x9d Although Obama has made his position clear before, the president risks potential backlash by weighing in on Brexit with two months remaining before Britons go to the polls on 23 June to vote on the referendum. It is uncommon for the White House to involve itself in matters pertaining to elections in other countries, and the administration typically tries to avoid doing so when scheduling both overseas trips and invitations of foreign leaders to Washington. But while in the UK, Obama will also hold a joint press conference with the prime minister, David Cameron, with whom the US president shares a close bond. Cameron has referred to Britain leaving the EU as â€œthe gamble of the centuryâ€\\x9d. The White House remained cautious about the optics of Obamaâ€™s visit, underscoring that the president had traveled to the UK several times before and that the focus of this trip would include counterterrorism and the fight against the Islamic State. â€œI think his approach will be that if heâ€™s asked his view as a friend, he will offer it, but he will make very clear that this is a matter the British people should decide when they head to the polls in June,â€\\x9d Rhodes said. Officials cited the economic interest of keeping Britain within the EU, framing its argument in similar terms deployed by the International Monetary Fund this week: the potential disruption of trade and commerce, and job losses in both the UK and Europe. â€œThe United Kingdom has exercised an outsized influence in the world for the last several centuries and itâ€™s one of the countries that has most shaped the modern era,â€\\x9d said Charlie Kupchan, a special assistant to Obama and the senior director for European Affairs at the White House. â€œAnd we hope that that outsized influence continues and we think that in todayâ€™s world, that kind of influence is best exercised through clubs, through multilateralism, through teamwork. And in that respect, itâ€™s our estimate that the United Kingdom will continue to play that role most effectively if it remains part of the European Union.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Year of electoral tests may end European Union as we know it In Italy and Austria this weekend a shaken EU faces the first of a series of pivotal electoral tests that could profoundly change the political landscape of the bloc, and conceivably herald the end of the European project in its current form. Shortly before last Mayâ€™s G7 meeting in Tokyo, Martin Selmayr, the senior Brussels official who runs the cabinet of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, tweeted what he described as his populist â€œhorror scenarioâ€\\x9d. Imagine, he said, if instead of Barack Obama, FranÃ§ois Hollande, David Cameron and Matteo Renzi, next yearâ€™s summit were to feature Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Boris Johnson and Beppe Grillo. Selmayr was right about Trump, now the US president-elect. He was half-right about Johnson, who missed out on the job of prime minister after Cameron resigned following Britainâ€™s Brexit vote, but did become foreign secretary. If he proves right on the rest, Europe will be in serious trouble. The angry, anti-establishment, nation-first tide that voted to sweep the UK out of the EU and Trump into the White House â€“ in what the billionaire property developer himself called a â€œBrexit plus, plus, plusâ€\\x9d â€“ is rising steadily across the continent. It is still far from certain to carry all before it. But over the next 12 months, EU member states face a dozen referendums and parliamentary and presidential elections, many contested by populist, Eurosceptic parties whose members believe that what happened in the UK and the US can now happen in Europe. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, has said â€œEurope could dieâ€\\x9d in the face of â€œattacks from the populistsâ€\\x9d. Germanâ€™s doughty finance minister, Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, has warned of the scourge of â€œdemagogic populismâ€\\x9d, while the EUâ€™s economic affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, suggested Europeâ€™s voters might be poised â€œto destroy itâ€\\x9d. The first two tests will be on Sunday. In Austria, voters elect a new president after their first attempt was annulled. In a race currently too close to call, Norbert Hofer, of the anti-immigration Freedom party, could become the first freely elected far-right head of state in western Europe since the second world war. On the same day, Italians vote in a referendum on constitutional reforms on which Renzi has staked his political future. Polls have suggested the prime minister will lose â€“ potentially bringing Grilloâ€™s fiercely anti-establishment Five Star Movement a step closer to power. The Netherlands goes to the polls on 15 March. There, Geert Wilders and his Eurosceptic, anti-Islam Freedom party is tied in the polls with the prime minister, Mark Rutteâ€™s liberal VVD. In France, the first round of presidential elections is on 23 April. The leader of the far-right, anti-European Front National, Marine Le Pen, is expected to advance from this to the runoff stage the following month. Germany votes later, in federal elections that could well see the far-right Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) enter parliament as the third-largest party, on the back of strong opposition to Angela Merkelâ€™s open-door refugee policy. And in the Czech Republic in October, the populists of ANO 2011, the Action of Dissatisfied Citizens, are forecast to win in the general elections. Simon Tilford, of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, said the two big flashpoints for the union would be Italyâ€™s constitutional referendum and Franceâ€™s presidential election. â€œIn Italy, if Renzi loses the referendum, canâ€™t survive, and elections then return a government committed to a referendum on taking [the country] out of the euro â€¦ that could produce a real standoff,â€\\x9d Tilford said. â€œAnd in France, if Le Pen should win ... We donâ€™t know what would happen, but sheâ€™s talked of a referendum on the euro, and on Franceâ€™s EU membership. A strongly Eurosceptic government in France would mean a full-blown crisis in Europe.â€\\x9d All this is by no means certain, of course. The populistsâ€™ confidence could be misplaced. All were quick to welcome the Brexit vote and Trumpâ€™s victory as events that, in Le Penâ€™s words, â€œmade possible what was considered impossibleâ€\\x9d. But in such uncertain times, voters could opt for continuity and stability: polls show support for the EU has surged since Britain voted to leave, and polling since the US election suggests no immediate â€œTrump bounceâ€\\x9d for the Eurosceptics. A victory in Austria by Hofer, the candidate from a party founded by a former SS officer, would be a huge symbolic blow for Europe and could presage worse in parliamentary elections to follow in 2018. Some, however, argue that its actual consequences may be limited: the presidential role is largely ceremonial. In Italy, Renzi could cling on, or be replaced by a technocratic government committed to continuing steady, incremental reform. And if snap elections do follow, Italyâ€™s electoral system does not necessarily make it easy for a single party to gain a majority in both houses of parliament. In France, every poll so far has predicted Le Pen will lose heavily in the second round to a more centrist rival, who, on current form, is likely to be the conservative FranÃ§ois Fillon. In the Netherlands, even if his toxic party emerges as the largest, Wilders is unlikely to be able to form a majority. But regardless of the electoral outcomes, Europeâ€™s upstarts will still shape the debate. Analysts point to the enormous influence exercised by the former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, even though he was never elected to Westminster, and how mainstream, centrist parties, particularly on the right, have been pulled inexorably to the more radical edge in the Netherlands and France. Mainstream leaders such as Merkel or Fillon would find themselves weakened, heading countries arguably more deeply divided than at any time in the postwar era, and struggling to push through their programmes. For the European project itself, its confidence knocked by Brexit, the upcoming Trump presidency, a continuing migrant crisis, the terrorism threat, an agonisingly slow return to strong economic growth and the gathering Eurosceptic backlash, the consequences could be serious. Faced with a more pressing need than ever to â€œget our act together, bring back a sense of direction, confidence, orderâ€\\x9d â€“ as the European council president, Donald Tusk, put it â€“ the bloc may find itself less able than ever to actually do so. Its instinct, certainly, will be to pull together and maintain unity at all costs â€“ not, from the UKâ€™s perspective, a good sign for productive Brexit negotiations â€“ and move forward forcefully where it can. The head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said the blocâ€™s challenge must be to provide â€œoutcomes that are both more efficient, and more directly aimed at the people, their needs and their fears â€“ not towards institution-buildingâ€\\x9d. Trumpâ€™s apparent fondness for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, along with his suggestion that US support for Nato â€“ the security umbrella that for 60 years has made European stability and prosperity possible â€“ may not be unconditional, has already prompted progress in one area. A Franco-German defence and security initiative launched in September has gained fresh impetus, with foreign and defence ministers agreeing concrete steps to bolster the blocâ€™s capacity to respond to conflicts and crises on its borders. The influential German MEP Manfred Weber said Trump â€œwill force Europe to grow upâ€\\x9d. Beyond security, analysts say, the unionâ€™s most pressing priority must be economic recovery, wage growth, the return of some sense of wellbeing. â€œNot that the whole anti-European backlash is solely attributable to that,â€\\x9d said Tilford. â€œBut the poor performance of the EU economy is a very big factor.â€\\x9d In fact, said Gianni Pittella, the leader of the European parliamentâ€™s Socialist group, Brexit and Trump had created a â€œhuge opportunityâ€\\x9d for strong, pragmatic EU initiatives. Will they happen? Will Europe advance, or crumble? The coming months and years will be critical. If anti-Europeans win national elections and the EU fails to rise to the nation-first challenge, it will struggle to survive in its present form. Few think it will break up entirely. But its ambitions may shrink; it could become more of commercial association than a 60-year-old, overarching political project. A hard eurozone core may ultimately emerge, with satellite â€œassociateâ€\\x9d members. Some, including in Britain, would regard that as a good thing. But according to Mark Leonard, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, in a less open world of trade barriers and anti-migrant walls, where solidarity among old allies must pass a cost-benefit analysis, they should be careful what they wish for. Ultimately, Leonard said in an article for Social Europe, â€œeven Europeâ€™s most Trump-like leaders will find it harder to defend their national interest if they try to go it alone. To survive in Trumpâ€™s world, they should try to make Europe great again.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Doctors to lobby for opt-out organ donor system Doctors will try to persuade ministers at Westminster, Holyrood and Stormont to introduce an opt-out system for organ donation to prevent 1,000 deaths a year because of organ shortages. The British Medical Association will lobby the three parliaments to follow the lead set by Wales, which in December introduced presumed consent for organ retrieval. Under this system people who die in hospital are presumed to have consented to their organs being used for transplantation unless they have expressly indicated otherwise. The doctorsâ€™ union believes that the dozens of lives estimated to have been saved in Wales since it adopted this approach means England, Scotland and Northern Ireland should do the same. The BMA voted at its annual conference to actively lobby to get the same approach adopted across the UK. â€œAs a doctor, it is difficult to see your patients dying and suffering when their lives could be saved or dramatically improved by a transplant,â€\\x9d said John Chisholm, chair of the BMAâ€™s public health medicine committee, who proposed the motion. â€œIt is even more difficult when we know that lives are being lost unnecessarily because of poor organisation, lack of funding or because people who are willing to donate organs after their death simply never get around to making their views known, resulting in relatives making a decision without knowing whether the individual was willing to donate.â€\\x9d Figures from UK Blood and Transplant, the NHS agency which manages organ transplantation, show that 6,485 seriously ill patients are currently on the waiting list to receive a new organ. Three people a day die because they do not get a new liver, heart, lungs or other body part. Thirty-one people who died in Wales between the start of December and the end of May donated 60 organs between them. Of these, 10 had their consent presumed because they had neither opted out nor joined the organ donor register. (That figure was up from 23 donors in the same six months the year before.) Of the 60 organs, 32 came from the 10 people whose consent was presumed under the new set-up. NHS Blood and Transplant said: â€œWe welcome activity that encourages people to discuss organ donation and to donate their organs for transplant. Our role is to work within whatever legislative frameworks are in place across the UK.â€\\x9d Meanwhile, Mark Porter, chair of the BMA, faces being ousted on Thursday amid discontent in the organisation, with members suggesting he is too â€œdetached and remoteâ€\\x9d and has not done enough to highlight growing problems in the NHS. Porter, who has led the 170,000-strong doctorsâ€™ union for the last four years, is being challenged as chair of the BMAâ€™s ruling council. JS Bamrah, a senior NHS consultant psychiatrist in Manchester, is seeking to replace him. BMA insiders say it is â€œ50/50â€\\x9d whether Porter, a consultant anaesthetist in Coventry, secures the required 17 votes when the 33-member council debates the issue at lunchtime on Thursday. A group of up to possibly 10 council members are disillusioned with his leadership, claiming he has become out of touch with many grassroots doctors and saying they are keen to see a change. The councilâ€™s four representatives of NHS junior doctors, whom sources say are undecided about which way to vote, are likely to prove significant in determining if Porter stays for his fifth and final year in office. Bamrah declined to speak to the media ahead of the vote. His Twitter account says his passions include the â€œNHS, mental health, parity and diversityâ€\\x9d. If he wins, he is set to lead the BMA for three years.',\n",
              "  'Deutsche Bank shares fall to new low after another turbulent day Deutsche Bank has endured another turbulent day on the stock market amid questions about its ability to pay a penalty to the US authorities and whether Angela Merkel will need to intervene in the plight of Germanyâ€™s biggest bank. As shares in Deutsche Bank fell to fresh lows, the German chancellor was quoted by news agencies as saying: â€œDeutsche Bank is one part of the German banking and financial sector, and of course we wish all companies, even when they are experiencing temporarily difficulties, to perform well. Apart from this, I donâ€™t want to comment.â€\\x9d She had been asked whether she believed the German government should support Deutsche Bank, which has endured a torrid year on the stock market where its shares have fallen more than 50%. The latest slide began on Monday after the bank was forced to deny it had asked for help from Merkel over the potential $14bn (Â£10.5bn) penalty it faces from the Department of Justice over mortgage bond mis-selling a decade ago. Deutsche Bank â€“ which has insisted it does not need government help and has no intention of paying that sum â€“ has also said it had enough capital although analysts said fears it would need to tap investors for funds was one of the reasons the shares were under pressure. Following Mondayâ€™s 7.5% fall to levels last reached in the 1980s, the shares fell another 3% on Tuesday to â‚¬10.19 before ending the day on the Frankfurt stock exchange flat at â‚¬10.55. The market is fixated on how the bank will tackle the negotiations with the DoJ and how large the penalty will eventually be. â€œIf the DoJâ€™s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary,â€\\x9d said Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at stockbroker MUFG Securities. â€œEquity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank, as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015,â€\\x9d said Tomas Kinmonth at Dutch bank ABN Amro. â€œTheir capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if Deutsche Bank wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders,â€\\x9d said Kinmonth. Deutsche Bankâ€™s chief executive, John Cryan, is also selling off its Chinese bank, Hua Xia, but there are some suggestions that its asset management division could also be put on the block. Some are pondering the wider ramifications. Paresh Davdra, co-founder of RationalFX, said the situation was rattling investors and raising parallels with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The German bank is not the only one facing discussions with the DoJ over the sale of the so-called residential mortgage-backed securities. Royal Bank of Scotlandâ€™s chief executive, Ross McEwan, told a conference on Tuesday that the bank had not yet begun discussions with the DoJ over the bailed-out bankâ€™s possible settlement. Analysts have calculated this could reach Â£9bn. Shares in RBS, 73% owned by taxpayers, fell 2.5% as McEwan also warned of â€œunchartered territoryâ€\\x9d if the bank failed to dispose of 600 branches mandated by the EU under the terms of its bailout. Other bank shares were also lower after another German bank, NordLB, postponed a bond issue. Former chancellor Norman Lamont told the Institute of Directors conference that German banks were in a dangerous situation: â€œThe biggest threat, I think, to Europe is the banking crisis. I think Italian banks are in a very serious situation; I think German banks are probably in a very serious situation, too.â€\\x9d â€¢This article was amended on Thursday 29 September to correctly assert that Deutsche Bank had insisted it does not need government help.',\n",
              "  'From Molenbeek to Hollywood â€“ why Belgian thriller Black is the new La Haine When Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah first read Dirk Brackeâ€™s novel Black, they sarcastically joked that it would be their â€œticket to Hollywoodâ€\\x9d, never imagining that such a thing was possible. As second-generation Moroccan-Belgians, they found that Black and its sequel â€“ a sort of West Side Story set in the immigrant suburbs of Brussels â€“ spoke to them. But as Arab teenagers seeking to break into Belgiumâ€™s tiny, overwhelmingly white film industry, the odds were stacked against them. Especially as it turned out someone else was already making a film of the book. Added to which, at the time, El Arbi and Fallah were in their first year at film school, which they duly flunked. And yet, 10 years later, here they are, on a blindingly sunny rooftop in downtown Los Angeles, thanks to Black â€“ which, of course, they ended up making after all. Itâ€™s difficult to imagine two more disparate places in the popular imagination than Hollywood and Molenbeek â€“ the Belgian suburb where Black was shot, now synonymous with Islamist terrorism. All of which makes their journey one of the most astonishing in recent cinema. Yet far from being culture-shocked, the pair seem completely at home. Fallah is even wearing an LA Dodgers baseball cap back-to-front. They have only been here three months, but between their street style, their Americanised English and the way they converse in tandem like a rap duo, you would never guess they were foreigners. As they re-enact the moment they got the call from Hollywood, they look and sound just like locals. Fallah: â€œI was in my apartment [in Brussels], around midnight. I looked on my phone and it said â€˜Beverly Hillsâ€™. What the fuck? â€˜Hello, itâ€™s Daniel Rappaport from Management 360.â€™ I was, like, â€˜Is this for real?â€™â€\\x9d El Arbi: â€œWe were like: â€˜Oh shit! American voice! Cool!â€™â€\\x9d Fallah: â€œThen they asked us what kind of movies we wanted to make. We said, â€˜Big shit! Gladiator or Star Wars.â€™â€\\x9d El Arbi: â€œThey said come to LA. We said, â€˜We got no money yâ€™all.â€™ So they came over to Brussels for 24 hours, we made a deal, then it was Toronto [film festival].â€\\x9d Fallah: â€œIn Toronto, that was the first taste we got of Hollywood. We saw big actors like Idris Elba and Naomi Watts. It was, like, â€˜Holy shit, itâ€™s becoming real.â€™â€\\x9d Itâ€™s about to get realer. They are about to begin shooting in South Central LA: a pilot for the FX network for a series on the cityâ€™s 1980s crack cocaine epidemic. Titled Snowfall, it is being produced by the legendary John Singleton, director of 1990s classic Boyz N the Hood â€“ a movie Bilall and El Arbi cite as one of their inspirations. Snowfall could almost be Boyz N the Hood the series, it seems. Other reference points they cite include The Wire and The Shield. In their round of Hollywood meetings, they also talked with uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the man behind Pirates of the Caribbean, Top Gun and innumerable other hits. â€œWe asked him: â€˜Hey! Can we do Bad Boys 3?â€™â€\\x9d says El Arbi. â€œHe said: â€˜Thereâ€™s a director already on that.â€™ He doesnâ€™t talk a lot.â€\\x9d But Bruckheimer did ask them to direct Beverly Hills Cop 4, Eddie Murphyâ€™s long-stalled comeback vehicle, which is now set for release next year. They havenâ€™t met Murphy yet, but apparently he personally approved them. â€œSo thatâ€™s already a big-ass honour,â€\\x9d says Fallah. El Arbi: â€œWe canâ€™t say too much but itâ€™s not an accident that they chose us. Itâ€™s more Detroit than Beverly Hills, thatâ€™s the general idea.â€\\x9d Fallah: â€œItâ€™s going to be a comedy, obviously, but itâ€™s going to also be edgy and harsh and real.â€\\x9d El Arbi: â€œWe know those kinds of places.â€\\x9d That is undeniable. Black, which went on to win the Discovery award at Toronto, hinges on the romance between a Moroccan petty criminal and a recently arrived Congolese girl, which sparks a war between their respective gangs, the 1080 and the Black Bronx. Itâ€™s a stylish, technically slick movie, full of dynamic camera moves and scored by a blend of Belgian hip-hop and north African beats (plus a local cover of Amy Winehouseâ€™s Back to Black). Yet it depicts an all-too-believable landscape of gang violence, criminality, discrimination, deprivation and rape. Blackâ€™s closest equivalent, and an influence the film-makers readily acknowledge, would be Mathieu Kassovitzâ€™s La Haine, which pulled off a similar trick of capturing both the youthful energy and the circumscribed prospects of Europeâ€™s immigrant margins, treading a fine line between commercial entertainment and gritty realism. â€œThat [La Haine] was 1995,â€\\x9d says El Arbi, â€œand when you look around, nothingâ€™s really changed. Itâ€™s actually worse.â€\\x9d Ironically, Black has been banned in France, he points out. â€œThey said the overall atmosphere and theme of the movie doesnâ€™t match with the political climate of the country.â€\\x9d El Arbi and Fallah make no apologies for wanting to make a commercially minded movie rather than a sombre social-realist drama. â€œThis should be told to as many people as possible,â€\\x9d says El Arbi, â€œeven though itâ€™s a really harsh kind of story. If youâ€™re gonna do social commentary and not have cinematic value to it, then not a lot of people are going to see it.â€\\x9d But thereâ€™s a palpable authenticity to Black. The story unfolds in subway stations and housing estates, primarily in Molenbeek and Matonge, respectively the north-African Arab and sub-Saharan African (primarily Congolese) districts of Brussels. The movie was shot on the streets and cast from them, too. And to the directorsâ€™ credit, thereâ€™s barely a false note in the performances, particularly from the two leads, Martha Canga Antonio and Aboubakr Bensaihi. Fallah: â€œYou donâ€™t have Moroccan or black actors. Certainly not between 15 and 21 years old. So, out of necessity, we had to go into the streets and into schools and on social media to find those actors.â€\\x9d El Arbi: â€œBelgian cinema really is white. You go to casting agencies and acting schools â€“ everybodyâ€™s white. We got together 400 people and selected the 16 best.â€\\x9d Fallah: â€œAnd for every character, there was a lot of choice. Thereâ€™s so much talent walking around.â€\\x9d How did they get such good performances out of them? El Arbi: â€œThe thing we said to every person was, â€˜Did you ever lie to your mother to go out? Or lie to your teacher?â€™ And then they knew, â€˜Ah, OK. Actors are liars!â€™â€\\x9d Itâ€™s clear that the directors know this landscape intimately. Growing up in Belgium (El Arbi is 30, Fallah 28), they experienced the same prejudices and disadvantages their young cast face today. â€œAntwerp was really one of the most racist cities in Europe,â€\\x9d says Fallah, who grew up there. â€œIt was the golden age of the Flemish Block, the racist party which won every fucking election during the 1990s. The only reason they never had power is because all the other parties had to club together and form a group against them.â€\\x9d He went to a predominantly white, Catholic school. â€œIn the beginning, you donâ€™t realise youâ€™re different. You think youâ€™re all the same, but after 9/11 happened, you came to school and everybody was, like, â€˜Are you happy now?â€™â€\\x9d El Arbi, who grew up in Brussels, also remembers that time. â€œWe knew back then, it was gonna be a suckass 10 years for us. We didnâ€™t imagine 15 years later it would be even worse.â€\\x9d Fallah and El Arbi both have family in Molenbeek. Both are saddened at the districtâ€™s current infamy as â€œjihadi centralâ€\\x9d, owing to the fact that many of those responsible for Islamist attacks across Europe hailed from there. Belgiumâ€™s policy of â€œghettoisingâ€\\x9d its immigrant communities in discrete areas is part of the problem, they say. They describe Molenbeek as â€œa different countryâ€\\x9d. The stores are all Moroccan; only Arabic or French are heard on the streets. Itâ€™s similar with Matonge. â€œItâ€™s like visiting Africa,â€\\x9d says Fallah. â€œBut if you go one street to the right, youâ€™re in a different world. Thatâ€™s typically Brussels.â€\\x9d The only white faces we see in Black are those of police officers. â€œIf you donâ€™t take people into society, you create a little bubble that doesnâ€™t interact with the real world, then you create those monsters,â€\\x9d he says. â€œEven if probably 90% of the people there are just normal people working and struggling.â€\\x9d â€œThereâ€™s no trust,â€\\x9d El Arbi adds, â€œItâ€™s not inclusive. The people that were in charge said, â€˜Weâ€™re not gonna help you, but weâ€™re not gonna bother you either. That is the most deadly combination ever. If you just let things happen, itâ€™s gonna be tough for good people to do good stuff and itâ€™s gonna be easy for evil people to do the evil stuff.â€\\x9d Black exposes more than one faultline running through Europe as a whole and Belgium in particular. On top of Islamophobia and racial discrimination (although tensions between Moroccan and Congolese communities are relatively rare in real life, they point out), the country is riven by a giant cultural divide: between the northern, Dutch-speaking Flemish community and the southern, French-speaking community. Thus, thereâ€™s an extra layer of social nuance in terms of language, El Arbi explains. â€œIf you talk French on the streets with your buddies, then youâ€™re cool, but if you talk Flemish, then youâ€™re a sellout. Flemish is the language of the rich people.â€\\x9d By the time Black adds in generational and gender divides, you are left wondering how Belgian society holds together at all. Fallah: â€œBelgium doesnâ€™t have an identity. You donâ€™t have a big history like France or Holland. Belgium is a young country.â€\\x9d El Arbi: â€œItâ€™s like a buffer, made by the UK and Germany.â€\\x9d Fallah: â€œItâ€™s artificial. Itâ€™s two worlds in one that they want to keep together.â€\\x9d El Arbi: â€œAnd when youâ€™re 15 and young, you want to have an identity. You want something clear. Blacks, Moroccans, theyâ€™ll never feel 100% Belgian. Even Belgians donâ€™t feel 100% Belgian. But drop them in Morocco or Congo, they will never be 100% either. So a gang or an extremist organisation can say: â€˜Come with us. You will have a name. You will be something. You are 1080 or Black Bronx â€“ or Isis.â€\\x9d The two film-makers formed their own gang at film school, being not just the only two non-white students but also the only ones with unashamedly commercial ambitions. Not that they donâ€™t worship the likes of Jean-Luc Godard, Michael Haneke and Lars Von Trier as well, they hasten to add. El Arbi: â€œIt was pre-hipster, but they were hipsters doing hipster movies â€“ poetic bullshit that you donâ€™t understand with no action in it, no conflict either, no ending. Just one character struggling with himself, and some water, some cryptic dialogue, some closeup shaky shit. Oh man!â€\\x9d Fallah: â€œWe were the only two Moroccans, but we were also the only two who wanted to go to Hollywood, and we referenced, like, Steven Spielberg ...â€\\x9d El Arbi: â€œ... Jerry Bruckheimer. That was, like, the big â€˜noâ€™ word. You donâ€™t mention Jerry Bruckheimerâ€™s name there. Thatâ€™s why we clicked together so well.â€\\x9d Fallah: â€œIt was us against the world.â€\\x9d They did find some allies, though. Their mentor at film school was MichaÃ«l Roskam, director of the Oscar-nominated Bullhead (which first brought actor Matthias Schoenaerts to attention). When they failed their first year (â€œWe were making war movies, comedy shit, it didnâ€™t really work out,â€\\x9d says Fallah), Roskam suggested they make movies more connected to their own backgrounds and identities. They won a prize with one of their first short films: funding to make another short. Instead, they used the money â€“ â‚¬120,000 (Â£100,000) â€“ to make a feature: Image, a thriller, again set in Molenbeek. It was a commercial success, though they describe it more as a â€œpractice runâ€\\x9d. Another crucial ally was Hans Herbots, an established Belgian film-maker. He was the one who was already making Black, the movie. On the strength of Image, and their personal connection to the subject matter, Herbots generously suggested that they direct Black instead of him, El Arbi explains. â€œAlso I think he was thinking: â€˜Fuck! A month in the hood in Molenbeek and me a white guy from Antwerp.â€™â€\\x9d When El Arbi and Fallah step into South Central a few days hence, they wonâ€™t feel quite so intimidated. They canâ€™t believe how smoothly everything happens here in Hollywood, compared with Belgium. They had sleepless nights on Black wondering if enough extras would turn up the next day, says El Arbi. â€œHere, itâ€™s like: â€˜You need 100 extras? All right. And theyâ€™ll be there, in 1983 period clothing and hairstyles, period cars on the streets, the LAPD closing the roads. In Belgium, the cops give you authorisation to shoot and thatâ€™s it. If thereâ€™s a gang member coming to threaten you with a knife, which happened on the first day in Matonge, they will not be there.â€\\x9d As with Black, though, the most important thing is the permission of the neighbourhoods where the real, often harrowing history they are recreating took place not so long ago. They have made efforts to include the communities where they are shooting, discussing and explaining the project, sometimes via â€œgang liaisonâ€\\x9d intermediaries. â€œYou gotta have the streets on your side,â€\\x9d says El Arbi. â€œThese are their stories.â€\\x9d The response has been broadly supportive, they say, even if locals donâ€™t always know what to make of them. â€œTheyâ€™re like, â€˜Where you from?â€™â€\\x9d says El Arbi. â€œWe say Belgium and Morocco. Theyâ€™re like Morocco ... Africa!â€\\x9d He holds out a silver pendant around his neck in the shape of Africa. Theyâ€™re honorary boyz in the hood. Perhaps they havenâ€™t come such a long way after all. El Arbi and Fallah havenâ€™t forgotten where they come from yet, they say. They are planning to make another movie there, after Snowfall and Beverly Hills Cop 4. But they also talk of shooting in Morocco, in Japan, of creating their own big-budget Hollywood science-fiction franchise. What were once dreams are now more like plans. And given their career trajectory so far, who is to say any of them are unrealistic? â€¢ Black is released in UK cinemas and on VOD platforms on 19 August',\n",
              "  'Cameronâ€™s cosy Christmas with Murdoch makes you admire Trumpâ€™s fighting talk Watch David Cameron start dropping round for seasonal drinks with Rupert and Rebekah again and it almost makes you warm to Donald Trump. The Donald wasnâ€™t endorsed by New Hampshireâ€™s most powerfully portentous newspaper for the coming primary test. The Union Leader is backing Chris Christie via a big front-page message from its publisher, Joseph McQuaid. But Trump doesnâ€™t take it gently, or nip round for a quiet gin and tonic. â€œYou have a very dishonest newspaper here,â€\\x9d he says. â€œItâ€™s also a failing newspaper. Itâ€™s going down the tubes. I remember when this was the big newspaper. Look at the size of this, now. If they cut it down any more, you wonâ€™t be able to find it.â€\\x9d As for McQuaid? â€œIâ€™ve watched this guy and, honestly, heâ€™s a loser.â€\\x9d Pass the peanuts, prime minister. â–  Pundits looking back at 2015 may wonder who got the general election result right. Zilch, nada, humiliation (for everyone up to and including David Cameron). Or who, as Ed Miliband resigned, would succeed him as Labour leader. Nada continued. But at least we can all unite now to blame HMG for its pitiful flood planning and inept reaction to the great rains. As the Daily Express declared last April: â€œHosepipe bans and speed showers could become the theme of the summer after experts warn that a drought could take over Britain.â€\\x9d Or, the same dear old Express warned last September: â€œFour months of heavy snow: Shock UK long-range weather forecast for THIS winter.â€\\x9d Drought, frost, tempestâ€¦ It makes spotting the rise of Jeremy Corbyn seem a breeze. â–  When I wrote (30 December) about EU referendum deal negotiations, I mentioned different talks between the FT and its journalistsâ€™ union over pension changes. FT management wishes me to point out that they, not the new Nikkei owners, are pursuing these â€œfor the long-term sustainabilityâ€\\x9d of the paper â€“ and that while 92% of NUJ members who voted (157 out of 171) wished to enable a strike, 89 other members didnâ€™t return a ballot form.

              "  'Judge orders internet providers to block illegal downloading websites The federal court has ordered internet providers to block major illegal download or torrenting websites, such as Pirate Bay and Torrentz, in a bid to crack down on online copyright infringement. Justice John Nicholas handed down his judgment on Thursday afternoon in Sydney, ordering internet service providers to â€œtake reasonable steps to disable accessâ€\\x9d to Pirate Bay, Torrentz, TorrentHound, IsoHunt and the streaming service SolarMovie within 15 working days. Foxtel and Village Roadshow filed their application in February. Village Roadshow sought to have SolarMovie blocked, while Foxtel targeted the four other sites. Telstra, Optus, TPG and M2 were the major respondents. It is the first time laws introduced with the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Act have been successfully applied since it passed in June last year. The federal court has allowed ISPs to determine how best to enact the order, with blocking domain names, IP addresses or target URLs among the possible strategies. Any other alternative means must be agreed upon in writing with the applicants. TPG has proposed using domain name system (DNS) blocking to target the sites to prevent them from getting around the ban by changing their IP addresses. Though Village Roadshow and Foxtel had proposed that the ISPs pay their own costs of compliance, the respondents uniformly opposed it. Nicholas said that there had been â€œa large measure of co-operation between the applicants and the respondentsâ€\\x9d. He proposed a â€œuniform amount for compliance costsâ€\\x9d determined by the number of domain names that the ISPs would be required to block. Peter Tonagh, the chief executive of Foxtel, welcomed the federal courtâ€™s ruling in a statement provided to the ABC. â€œThis judgment is a major step in both directly combating piracy and educating the public that accessing content through these sites is not OK, in fact it is theft. â€œThis judgment gives us another tool to fight the international criminals who seek to profit from the hard work of actors, writers, directors and other creators the world over.â€\\x9d Foxtel or Village Roadshow will have to apply to have any new websites added to the judgement. Universal Musicâ€™s action to have Kickass Torrents blocked remains active. A landmark case against Australian internet users accused of pirating the film Dallas Buyers Club was dropped by the plaintiff, DBC LLC, in February. A federal court judge had said it was â€œwholly unrealisticâ€\\x9d for the ISP iiNet to hand over the personal details of almost 5,000 customers who were accused of having downloaded the film.',\n",
              "  \"Battleground states: North Carolina's sharp divides put election on knife-edge North Carolina has been in the eye of many storms this year. The state of emergency declared by Governor Pat McCrory ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Matthew this weekend follows similar civil measures in September when the police killing of a black man set off a wave of angry protests on the streets of the stateâ€™s largest city, Charlotte. Few of the tempests to sweep by in 2016 have defined the national mood quite as much, though, as the political maelstrom battering this state. A vital battleground in the presidential election, North Carolina could determine whether Donald Trump manages to assemble enough angry white voters to make it all the way to the White House. A â€œbathroom banâ€\\x9d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of Americaâ€™s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America. But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is putting off many moderates and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November. What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater. The recent protests against the killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte took place among gleaming downtown high-rises of the New South â€“ race riots shattering the calm of what otherwise appears a diverse and progressive boomtown at the heart of one of Americaâ€™s major transport and financial hubs. Pride in North Carolinaâ€™s modern and open economy is still visible, despite the high-profile battles over sexual and racial equality. Drive into the state from the north, and road signs quickly herald its repeated ability to win Nobel prizes, celebrating last yearâ€™s award of the chemistry prize to a Turkish American biochemist, Aziz Sancar, based at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill. He proudly spoke of being a US Muslim at his acceptance speech and told a Turkish newspaper that Trump should not be allowed to obscure Americaâ€™s multicultural progress in the eyes of the world. The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, the first African American woman to hold the nationâ€™s highest law enforcement job, is another famous North Carolinian. She clashed with the Republican governor, McCrory, when he signed the bathroom ban into law, filing a federal civil rights lawsuit against the legislation known as HB2, and she has spoken eloquently about the danger that recent clashes between police and violent protesters in Charlotte â€œdrown out the voices of changeâ€\\x9d in the country. Yet many young liberals in North Carolina are reeling from recent events, worried about the way their state is perceived around the country in ways that echo how many Americans feel about what Trump is doing to the image of the United States internationally. â€œIt embarrasses me,â€\\x9d says Jamisen Moore, a young medical engineering student at the UNC campus in Greensboro, a town once famous for civil rights protests at a segregated Woolworth counter that is now trying to buck the conservative backlash. â€œThere is a weird mood politically,â€\\x9d she explains. â€œIt brings out all the people who are at one extreme or another. People who think itâ€™s a good idea are really vocal but the people who donâ€™t are not, even though they think itâ€™s bad, they are not out there and as loud.â€\\x9d UNC Greensboro was one of the campuses that refused to implement the state-wide ban on allowing transgender students to use bathroom facilities of their choice. Yet the university has nonetheless been swept up in the backlash. In September, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) pulled a high-profile basketball tournament out of the state in protest at what it saw as unacceptable discrimination. Days later, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) did the same with big football games. â€œDuke [University] and UNC is the biggest rivalry in college basketball and we were going to be able to host it in our state but now we wonâ€™t be able to because of HB2,â€\\x9d says Moore, who believes the decisions have helped â€œwake people upâ€\\x9d to the cost of being a pariah state. It is not just students and sports fans who are appalled either. The mayor of Greensboro, Nancy Vaughan, describes the fight over civil liberties as the â€œbest of times and the worst of timesâ€\\x9d because it is also helping galvanize moderate voters to stand up against those who pushed through the law and tend to lean more loudly toward Trump. â€œThese things have a habit of sorting themselves out and we will prevail,â€\\x9d said Vaughan during a recent rally at the campus by Hillary Clinton. â€œI bet there are people right here in this room who didnâ€™t vote in the last council election â€¦ You know what? You are the problem. We need to get new voters to the polls in November.â€\\x9d But in the meantime, the economic cost is high. The Charlotte Chamber of Commerce estimates that more than 1,000 jobs lost and $285m in economic damage has been caused by companies shunning the state in reaction to its illiberal policies. â€œA state that sanctions discrimination will never be a world leader; instead, weâ€™ll have to play second fiddle to other groups.â€\\x9d wrote local businessman Lloyd Smith after he was challenged to intervene by a customer who called the state â€œbackwardâ€\\x9d for allowing HB2. â€œIt is the antithesis of building an economy for everyone,â€\\x9d added Mayor Vaughan. â€œThis is a law that hurts our families our social fabric and our economy.â€\\x9d Even Governor McCrory seems anxious to mitigate the worst affects of the legislation, signing an executive order protecting state employees from being fired for being gay or transgender after state lawmakers threatened to introduce anti-discrimination safeguards. And he seems acutely conscious that the stateâ€™s reputation could be further hurt by the national controversy over police violence. â€œCharlotte is a great city and we are not going to let a few hours make a negative impact,â€\\x9d said the governor in statement after the first night of disturbances over the killing of 43-year-old Scott. McCrory was lagging in the polls when he first appeased the Tea Party right by signing HB2 into law, and dismissed critics in Trumpian terms by claiming â€œpolitical correctness [had] run amokâ€\\x9d, but Trumpâ€™s surge in North Carolina may be fading too and both could lose here in November. Recent polls also reveal the social fragmentation driving state and national politics. Few swing states are as polarized, with Trump ahead by up to 53% to 28% among white voters, while Clinton has overwhelming black support at 86% to 3%. North Carolina also has a huge split among educational lines, with college-educated voters flocking to her and those without qualifications drawn to him. For all the vaunted success of the so-called â€œresearch triangleâ€\\x9d, Nobel prize-winning research does not employ enough to make up for the collapse in manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the state. One town just outside the gleaming new economy, Goldsboro, recently came bottom of a national league table for declines in its middle class. It is no surprise that both Trump and Clinton are spending more time in North Carolina than almost any other state in the country.\",\n",
              "  'Stiff upper lip or man on the edge? How movies see real-life heroes This weekâ€™s biggest film release in the US is Deepwater Horizon â€“ a film that, despite its title, is neither an underwater sequel to Event Horizon nor a delicate coming-of-age story about waifish teens growing up in rural Sweden. Itâ€™s the very real, very tragic tale of the 2010 oil rig explosion that killed 11 people and caused an environmentally catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Mark Wahlberg stars as Mike Williams, the chief electrician aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the man tasked with saving as many of its occupants as possible. The film is the latest in a parade of gritty, true stories hitting cinemas as we stumble into the fall awards season. It was only a few weeks ago that audiences were exposed to Clint Eastwoodâ€™s Sully, another dramatization of a simple hero thrust unwillingly into a position to have to rescue dozens of people. Thatâ€™s how we like our real-life protagonists â€“ stoic, grimly determined and covered in motor oil. We also like them to suffer for their good works. Poor Sully lands an airplane on the Hudson river, no one dies, and he still gets chastised by those damn bureaucrats (please read in gravelly Clint Eastwood voice) when he gets home. Brave Mike Williams survives the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but those dastardly oil barons at BP (please read in nasally Dave Schilling voice) donâ€™t go to jail. Time after time, the system fails the noble working man in American cinema. Considering my unique position working for a major British media company, I couldnâ€™t help but wonder what the British equivalent of our tradition of ripped-from-the-headlines stories of valor is. Letâ€™s just say that theyâ€™re not all that similar. American real-life heroes What we just canâ€™t get enough of these days are stories about small figures caught up in tide of major global events. Oliver Stoneâ€™s Snowden doesnâ€™t turn the soft-spoken whistleblower Edward Snowden into a swashbuckler for truth and justice. The real Snowden is quiet, thoughtful and deeply beholden to his own personal moral compass. Deepwater Horizon director Peter Berg also helmed another Mark Wahlberg working-class tragedy called Lone Survivor, which is about a group of Navy Seals fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Last yearâ€™s little-seen Chris Pine movie The Finest Hours is about a coastguard rescue of a sinking oil tanker. What is it with the production of fossil fuels and calamity? Youâ€™d almost think it was a horrible idea which is slowly killing the planet. Tom Hanks knows this genre well, not just as Sully, but also as the titular Captain Phillips. But itâ€™s not just modern movies. Go back to the 1970s, after the obsession with retelling the legends of world war two wore off, to find a multitude of films about the common man. By the way, I donâ€™t use the word â€œmanâ€\\x9d here casually. Unfortunately, most of the movies in this genre are about men. Serpico is easily in the top five films of this genre, placing Al Pacino in the role of Frank Serpico, another whistleblower who uncovers rampant corruption within the New York police department. Even if he had one of the coolest names in history, Serpicoâ€™s story is not an epic one. At the end of the film, he retires a physically broken man whoâ€™s merely done what any righteous person should in his situation. He spoke up. He just happened to speak up in a situation where there were guns, drugs and death involved, which makes his life far more cinematic than, say, mine. You wonâ€™t get much excitement out of watching me type and eat chips for eight hours a day, which leads me to the grand tradition of the British real-life drama. British real-life heroes I hope that youâ€™ve all already watched Morten Tyldumâ€™s The Imitation Game, because Iâ€™m about to spoil it for you. In this film, the Nazis lose the second world war. If you werenâ€™t aware and didnâ€™t heed my spoiler warning, Iâ€™m sorry. I lobbied my editors for a page break, just in case, but I was denied. The Imitation Game is but the most recent addition to the grand tradition of the British based-on-a-true-story film. Imitation Gameâ€™s hero, brilliant mathematician Alan Turing, is also a reluctant hero, as in the American tradition. He suffers the slings and arrows of a system that does not understand him nor is willing to recognize his contribution to the war effort. His cracking of the Enigma code is crucial to the Allied cause, but because he was gay, the military history books relegated him to footnote status until very recently. So, whatâ€™s different between Alan Turing and Sully Sullenberg besides differing tastes in facial hair? First of all, Alan Turing knows heâ€™s brilliant. What propels him to continue working on the machine that would help break the code and to defy superiors who doubted his efforts is self-belief. Turingâ€™s lack of social graces in the film means that he often says what he is thinking, which is that he knows better. Itâ€™s safe to say the protagonist of Deepwater Horizon lacks this rarefied air. This is not to say that the average British hero is some strutting peacock and the American is a stern puritan. Itâ€™s notable only in that itâ€™s a subversion of audience stereotypes and expectations. Whatâ€™s more pressing in this analysis is the contrast between the man of action and the man of principle, or in the case of the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, the woman. Made in Dagenham does not have explosions, gunfire or sweaty dudes covered in grease. Sally Hawkins stars as a fictional character plopped into the true story of a workersâ€™ strike at a Ford motor company sewing plant in the Dagenham area of London. Note that a protagonist was invented for the purposes of dramatizing this story. In order to make a movie out of a collective social action, a person had to be invented. Similarly, the Sally Field film Norma Rae, an American film about the labor movement, fictionalized Crystal Lee Sutton. Norma Rae is something of an outlier in American film in that itâ€™s a movie that glorifies the unionization of labor rather than exalting the â€œlone survivorâ€\\x9d story that we Yankees crave, while the British routinely revel in films like Pride, about LGBT activists who get involved in the 1984 British minersâ€™ strike. Pride is an unabashed ensemble piece about how collective action can uplift people of all stripes. Modern Britain does seem to be becoming less and less amenable to progressive ideas, but there still remains that kernel of the European fascination with democratic socialism. In these British films, the system is still the enemy, but it can only be defeated with a group effort. When the story is one of individual effort, British film tends to focus on the criminal figure â€“ Roger Daltry in McVicar or more recently, Tom Hardy as the Kray brothers in Legend. Itâ€™s no coincidence that British true-story films that do well in America are usually ones that narrow their focus to one transcendent figure â€“ King George VI in The Kingâ€™s Speech, Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, or Alan Turing. Americans want heroes who succeed in spite of others, but in Britain, sometimes itâ€™s OK for those heroes to succeed because of others.',\n",

              "  'A Trump trainwreck is the only thing that will save the Republican party Republicans face a lot of difficult decisions this year, but for the party to come back strong after Donald Trumpâ€™s divisive candidacy â€“ for it to keep its brand as the free-market, democracy-loving, opportunity-focused alternative to the Democrats â€“ the least-worst option is a major loss in the presidential race. By selecting a nominee who does not reflect the usual fiscal policies, a victory for Trump will mean a shift in the partyâ€™s focus. Even if the rest of the GOP holds fast to the platform or to traditional conservative values, the presidentâ€™s policies always reshape the party. If you have ever promoted a local candidate to voters, you know this is true â€“ the public looks at the top of the ticket first and judges the party by that personâ€™s views. Many Trump supporters will see his win as a referendum on their policies and will work to make the party reflect that. Fellow Republicans will either need to accept that or leave. We have no idea what a Trump presidency will look like, but based on his campaign, it will be filled with outrageous gaffes, inarticulate interviews on policy and offensive media blitzes focused on non-issues. Trump will most likely lose minorities and women, creating a wider divide that the GOP must bridge in the future. Many young voters will continue to associate Trump with the party long after he leaves office. This would only further damage Republicans and set us up for heavy losses in 2018. Not to mention the party will continue to hemorrhage its best and brightest. Candidates, staff and volunteers have already walked away from Trump, and thereâ€™s no question it will keep happening. If Trump gains a greater control of the party, these people might even be forced out. But letâ€™s say Trump doesnâ€™t win and Hillary Clinton claims the White House. If Trump only trails her by a few points, you can bet he will blame the Republicans who voted their conscience. Or heâ€™ll kick up dirt over the â€œriggedâ€\\x9d system, as he has already alluded to. Trump supporters in the party will go on a witch-hunt, looking for anyone who acted disloyally to the Republican nominee. That in-fighting could destroy the party. Only a loss by a wide margin would send a clear message to the Republican party: this is the wrong choice for America. If Trump loses the swing states and also sees lower numbers in deeply red states, the party would have to accept that even Republicans could not vote for this candidate. This doesnâ€™t mean Republicans need to lose down-ballot, though Trump will make it an uphill battle. The GOP has a strong hold on the House of Representatives, which is unlikely to be shaken this election (though a President Trump could alter that security in two years). Red states wonâ€™t suddenly lose their conservative ideals and vote out the representatives that reflect them. Even the Senate could remain in Republican control if the RNC focuses on securing weak candidates. Those worried that a vote for Trump is the only way to balance the US supreme court should refocus their efforts on the Senate, where the real decisions are made. Without the Senateâ€™s approval, a permanent supreme court justice cannot be appointed. All is not lost without the presidency; Congress is still the power behind the throne. Republicans need to take a sincere look at how we run our primaries. We also need to find ways to address the concerns of members who voted for Trump â€“ without losing sight of what it means to be a Republican. This will take time, and the healing will be slow. But a stronger party could rise up, and unlike many Trump supporters, the Republicans who will not vote for Trump will happily return to rebuild the GOP if they are invited.',\n",
              "  \"Fox News' structure is changing â€“ but don't expect its coverage to do the same A glance at the headlines would have you believe Fox News is on the ropes. Its former chairman, CEO and spiritual leader, Roger Ailes, has not only been ousted but buried under a pile of sexual abuse allegations. New horror stories from female employees trickle out every week, with top brass implicated in a pervasive culture of misogyny and harassment. Meanwhile, its audience is dying off: the median Fox viewer is 67 yearsold, according to Nielsen. All these things are true, and tend to fuel speculation that the network will have to clean house, name a successor, and move away from fire and brimstone toward a fresher, gentler Fox News. That possibility is shrinking faster than Donald Trumpâ€™s poll numbers. On Friday, with a certain Spartan vibe, Rupert Murdoch created a new Fox News co-presidency shared by longtime Ailes lieutenant Bill Shine, who may yet be implicated in enabling Foxâ€™s epidemic of sexual abuse, and local TV chief Jack Abernethy. It was a symbolic double-promotion, but both are under daddyâ€™s supervision. The true successor to Ailes â€“ who is still fighting the abuse allegations and vehemently denies wrongdoing â€“ will be the next CEO and chairman. Candidates range from insiders such as executive editor John Moody and head of news Jay Wallace to superstar outsiders such as CBS president David Rhodes. But whoever shows up wonâ€™t have anything close to the control of â€œthe Chairmanâ€\\x9d, whose influence at Fox operates on a genetic level. Ailes has been banished, but the creature he electrified to life two decades ago now roams free on its own. â€œDonâ€™t expect them to make a big change in their coverage,â€\\x9d said Jane Hall, former Fox contributor and professor of media studies at American University. â€œItâ€™s a highly successful formula.â€\\x9d Fox is a money monster, pumping out over $1bn in profits a year. It rakes in about 20% of 21st Century Foxâ€™s earnings, the most profitable unit in the empire. Perhaps thatâ€™s why the Murdoch brothers, Lachlan and James, heirs to News Corp patriarch Rupert and no fans of Ailes, told investors last week that they had no intention of tinkering with the â€œunique and important voiceâ€\\x9d of their moneymaker. Despite all the drama, former employees say that Fox is a money machine that can run the way it always has â€“ and make the profits it always has â€“ in a post-Ailes era. â€œThe network can coast for years just on the institutional memory,â€\\x9d said Joe Muto, who worked as a producer for Fox star Bill Oâ€™Reilly for eight years before eventually going out in a blaze of glory after dishing the dirt on his employer to Gawker. â€œAiles wanted to be successful, powerful and, yes, wanted to push his ideology,â€\\x9d Muto said. â€œMurdoch, I think, is less ideological, but he will default to whatever makes him money. And Fox has been a piggy bank. You look at their balance sheet and Fox underwrites other losses.â€\\x9d The idea that a new CEO could steer Fox into something closer to CNN, or the smaller, friendlier conservative outlet Newsmax, presupposes that the profit motive is not driving one of the biggest media conglomerates on the planet. Not only does it continue to dominate ratings, itâ€™s such an essential part of Americaâ€™s media diet that most of its money comes from â€œcarriageâ€\\x9d fees paid by the cable companies. And then thereâ€™s the very good chance that this fall, voters will gift Fox another Clinton in the White House. Not only would it keep the network in the simple, righteous role of loyal opposition to liberal tyranny, it would also be a great return to the climate of Clinton-bashing that put Fox on the map back in the 90s. â€œI think a Hillary presidency would guarantee the network maintains its rightwing bent for a few more years, even with the Murdoch brothers in control,â€\\x9d said one ex-producer. Muto had a colorful metaphor at the ready: â€œI would compare it to Batman and the Joker. Batman is a much more interesting character when he has the Joker as a foil. And Hillary Clinton is the Joker to Foxâ€™s Batman.â€\\x9d If Trump won, the network would have a trickier time. For one thing, Fox generally does better under a Democratic reign. Itâ€™s true that the network became No 1 under Bushâ€™s first term, but that was no doubt fuelled by the nonstop drama of 9/11, the invasion of Afghanistan, a climate of paranoia, and the culmination of the Iraq war â€“ which, of course, Fox helped sell skillfully. â€œI donâ€™t know how it would have played out without 9/11 and the Iraq war,â€\\x9d Hall said. But eventually, Bush proved to be thin gruel, ratings-wise. â€œI think Bush winning in â€™04 was a triumph for the network, but it went downhill quickly from there,â€\\x9d Muto said. â€œThe war started going badly. Hurricane Katrina happened. There was this sense that the network was having trouble carrying water for Bush any more. There was an overall sense of doom at Fox between Katrina and when the 2008 primaries began heating up.â€\\x9d The ratings tell that story: from 2006 to 2007, Fox dropped to 1.4 million average viewers, down from 1.7 million a year before, according to Nielsen. By the end of 2008, they had shot up to 2 million. â€œIt felt like the network was licking its chops for Hillary in 2008,â€\\x9d said Muto. â€œâ€˜Our old nemesis is back.â€™ Then when Obama showed up, it was even better.â€\\x9d By 2009, the numbers were up to almost 2.2 million. Ratings have dipped in the latter half of Obamaâ€™s second term, but a Clinton regime could be just the thing to reignite the base. â€œThey can continue to attack the flaws of Bill Clinton through her,â€\\x9d said Hall. â€œSheâ€™s also, obviously, a woman. Iâ€™m sure that if she wins theyâ€™ll go after her as a â€˜socialistâ€™, go after her in every way, personally. Sheâ€™s much better for them.â€\\x9d Trump, on the other hand, would probably continue to fracture any sense of unity on the right, which is no good for Foxâ€™s narratives of right v wrong, secular liberals v decent Americans. Then thereâ€™s just Trumpâ€™s unpredictability. â€œTo me, the worst thing that can happen for the network is Trump gets elected,â€\\x9d said Muto. â€œThe prospect of carrying his water for four or eight years is unthinkable. Hannity will obviously give it a shot, Fox and Friends will try as hard as they can. But when you have him attacking the parents of war heroes, Fox is not gonna defend that for that long.â€\\x9d Politics aside, Fox has a more concrete problem. The generational scare is real: the 25-54 demographic is only 17% of its audience and younger conservatives are generally far less interested in enlisting to fight against the â€œwar on Christmasâ€\\x9d. Its digital presence, the portal to that treasured younger audience, is lacking. Among competitors like CNN (which spent $20m expanding online operations), Yahoo, BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post, last year Fox ranked third place in multi-platform views, sixth place in video streams, and trailed on social. Fox gets good play on Facebook, but thatâ€™s thanks to brand recognition rather than deliberate strategy or forging partnerships with emerging distributors like Snapchat. â€œDigital always did seem like it was never part of the strategy â€“ that was never the thinking,â€\\x9d Muto said. â€œThe whole network was very ratings-focused, short-sighted. If they want to attract a younger audience and eyeballs on digital, they need to recruit some new talent who knows how to do that.â€\\x9d An ex-producer agrees: â€œOne of the more puzzling things about Fox News is that they actually do have some legitimately talented field reporters â€“ people who could conceivably get a scoop, break it on Twitter, and post an article that goes viral. But they donâ€™t really do that ever.â€\\x9d â€œCNN has become the model for this, and part of me thinks Roger long wanted to resist copying them lest he admit they did something better,â€\\x9d the onetime employee said. Perhaps now with Ailes gone, and President Hillary Clinton possibly on the way, Fox can get started on catching up. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.\",\n",
              "  'Led Zeppelin to release expanded version of their BBC Sessions compilation Just when you thought your bank account and shelves were safe, Led Zeppelin have announced another mammoth deluxe reissue, following the complete remastering of their Atlantic Records catalogue over the last few years. This time itâ€™s The Complete BBC Sessions, an upgrade on the BBC Sessions album released in 1997. The unique selling point this time is a third disc, featuring eight previously unrecorded recordings, including a â€œlost sessionâ€\\x9d the BBC had wiped from its archive â€“ the version of that session comes from a fanâ€™s radio recording. That session includes one Zeppelin song unavailable in any form on any other release, Sunshine Woman (though, naturally, you can hear it in seconds if you search YouTube), which was recorded for Alexis Kornerâ€™s Rhythm and Blues programme on the BBC World Service on 19 March 1969. All the sessions were recorded between 1969 and 1971, and feature songs dating up to the fourth Zeppelin album, including a version of Stairway to Heaven recorded on 1 April 1971. Naturally, there is no ordinary edition of the set. The entry-level version is a 3CD or 5LP â€œdeluxe editionâ€\\x9d. Those willing to mortgage their houses or sell one of their childrenâ€™s kidneys can go for the super deluxe box set, with both vinyl and CDs and the additional baubles â€“ a book, a print, a download code.

              "  'Minimum UK alcohol pricing gets backing of official health advisers A review commissioned by the government from its health advisers has concluded that ministers should introduce minimum unit pricing of alcohol to tackle the grim medical, economic and social toll of drink-related harm. The in-depth study(pdf) has found that drink is now the biggest killer of people aged between 15 and 49 in England. It accounts for 167,000 years of lost productivity each year and is a factor in more than 200 different illnesses. It leads to such huge harm that the lost economic activity it produces, through early death and disability among workers, is more than that for the 10 most common cancers combined, the review found. The studyâ€™s publication by Public Health England (PHE) is an embarrassment for ministers because it says they should embrace a policy that they have rejected due to an alleged lack of evidence. The report says: â€œPolicies that reduce the affordability of alcohol are the most effective, and cost-effective, approaches to prevention and health improvement â€¦ Implementing an MUP [minimum unit price] is a highly targeted measure which ensures any resulting price increases are passed on to the consumer, improving the health of the heaviest drinkers who experience the greatest amount of harm. MUP would have a negligible impact on moderate drinkers and the price of alcohol sold in pubs, bars and restaurants.â€\\x9d The coalition government pledged in March 2012 to bring in the policy, but it made a U-turn in July 2013, earning condemnation from medical organisations and arousing strong suspicions that it had caved in to intense lobbying by the alcohol industry. PHE, the governmentâ€™s advisory agency on public health issues including obesity and smoking, published its â€œcomprehensive review of the evidence on alcohol harm and its impact in Englandâ€\\x9d in the Lancet medical journal on Friday. Sources say senior PHE officials feel its remit prevents it from explicitly backing minimum pricing, though ministerial opposition may also be a factor. Nevertheless, the report leaves little doubt regarding its support for the policy, observing that â€œthe financial burden which alcohol-related harm places on society is not reflected in its market price, with taxpayers picking up a larger amount of the overall cost compared to the individual drinkersâ€\\x9d. It says pricing policies should be updated in line with changes in income and inflation, â€œin order to retain their relative affordability and therefore be able to impact upon alcohol-related harmâ€\\x9d. The new analysis has examined all the available evidence globally on alcohol harm and the steps effective in reducing it. PHE makes clear that the pricing of drink and the way it is marketed â€“ issues of concern to medical groups â€“ need to be urgently re-examined. It says policies can â€œaddress market failures by protecting people from the harm caused by other peopleâ€™s drinking, deterring children from drinking, and improving consumer awareness of the risks of alcohol consumption.â€\\x9d The review, undertaken by PHE and researchers from Sheffield University, found that the economic burden of health, social and economic alcohol-related harm was substantial, with estimates placing the annual cost at between 1.3% and 2.7% of annual GDP. â€œIn 2015 there were an estimated 167,000 working years lost due to alcohol, 16% of all working years lost in England,â€\\x9d it says. â€œMore working years are lost to alcohol than the 10 most frequent cancer types combined.â€\\x9d The authorsâ€™ conclusions will pose difficulties for the Department of Health, which asked PHE to undertake the assessment of the latest research. It will now face questions about why the government is not pushing ahead with introducing the policy, given that the evidence suggests it would be effective. In 2013 the government justified abandoning its plans by saying public consultation had â€œnot provided evidence that conclusively demonstrates that minimum unit pricing will actually do what it is meant to: reduce problem drinking without penalising all those who drink responsibly.â€\\x9d It is unclear how Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, will respond to the results of a review that his own department asked PHE to instigate. Medical groups want ministers to take tougher action on alcohol. Although total alcohol consumption has fallen since 2008, that has not been accompanied by a drop in alcohol-related harm. Nicola Sturgeonâ€™s Scottish National party government in Edinburgh plans to introduce minimum unit pricing in Scotland if it successfully sees off a legal challenge against the policy brought by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA). The Holyrood administration won the last round of the battle in the courts in Edinburgh in October, but the SWA is appealing against that decision at the UK supreme court in London. The Scottish government hopes to set a minimum price of 50p a unit, the level backed by many doctors. The scrapped Westminster plan was to have set the level at 45p a unit. Medical and public health groups are likely to welcome the new findings but alcohol firms are expected to dismiss them. Manufacturers often argue that a minimum unit price would penalise responsible drinkers who stick to the amounts of alcohol recommended by the chief medical officers of the four home nations. That guidance was revised in January to set a weekly consumption limit of 14 units for men as well as women, down from the 21 units previously advised for males. However, previous evidence has concluded that the move would save thousands of lives because the heaviest drinkers are most likely to consume less as a result of the hike in price. â€¢ This article was amended on 2 December 2016 to add a mention of the Scotch Whisky Associationâ€™s legal challenge to plans for minimum unit pricing of alcohol in Scotland. An earlier version said the SNP government was â€œpressing aheadâ€\\x9d with the introduction of the policy.',\n",
              "  \"Donald Trump to Dr Oz: I feel 'as good today as I did at 30' On the day Donald Trump told TV host Dr Oz he feels â€œas good today as I did at 30â€\\x9d, the 70-year-old Republican presidential nominee released the most detailed assessment yet of his physical condition. The Trump campaign used the release to take a swipe at Hillary Clinton, lauding the billionaireâ€™s ability to â€œendure â€“ uninterrupted â€“ the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaignâ€\\x9d. Clinton temporarily withdrew from the campaign trail after stumbling as she left a 9/11 memorial service in New York City on Sunday. Her campaign subsequently said she had pneumonia. In a taped interview with Dr Oz scheduled to be aired later on Thursday, Trump admitted that at 236lb he is overweight, but said he had bolstered his physical condition by giving speeches on the campaign trail. â€œItâ€™s a lot of work,â€\\x9d he said. â€œYou know, when Iâ€™m speaking in front of 15, 20,000 people and Iâ€™m up there using a lot of motion, I guess in its own way itâ€™s a pretty healthy act. â€œA lot of times these rooms are really hot, like saunas, and I guess thatâ€™s a form of exercise.â€\\x9d Trump also plays golf. Before Trumpâ€™s interview with Dr Oz, his campaign released a statement from Dr Harold Bornstein, the same physician who in December said in a shorter note he could â€œstate unequivocally, [Trump] will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidencyâ€\\x9d. Bornstein later admitted the note had been â€œrushedâ€\\x9d while a limo from the campaign waited outside his office. On Thursday, the reported that according to court papers, in April 2002 Bornstein agreed to pay $86,250 to the family of a patient, Janet Levin, who allegedly died after falling when she took â€œunhealthy amountsâ€\\x9d of prescription drugs Bornstein had given her. Before settling, Bornstein denied all the allegations against him. The report on Trumpâ€™s health released on Thursday was based on an examination conducted on Friday 9 September. It was less hyperbolic than Bornsteinâ€™s first note, but still glowing. â€œMr Trump is in excellent physical health,â€\\x9d Bornstein wrote, adding that Trumpâ€™s liver and thyroid functions were within the normal range, and that a cardiac evaluation was normal. Trump takes medication to lower cholesterol Trumpâ€™s testosterone was listed at 441.6. â€œHe doesnâ€™t have unusually high testosterone nor does he have unusually low testosterone,â€\\x9d said Dr Abraham Morgentaler, author of the book Testosterone for Life, adding that â€œ450 or so is an average testosterone level in adult menâ€\\x9d. Trumpâ€™s most recent colonoscopy was conducted on 10 July 2013, Bornstein said. It revealed no polyps. On the Dr Oz Show, Trump said that when he looks in the mirror he does not see a 70-year-old man. â€œI would say I see a person thatâ€™s 35 years old,â€\\x9d he said. The campaign did not release any ophthalmic results. Trump told Oz he sometimes plays golf with the 39-year-old New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. â€œI feel Iâ€™m the same age as him. Itâ€™s crazy,â€\\x9d Trump said. Clips released in advance of the showâ€™s broadcast saw Oz noting that Trump would be the oldest person ever to be elected president. Trump said that he was not that much older than one previous Republican president. â€œJust about the same age as Ronald Reagan,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAnd Hillaryâ€™s a year behind me. I actually feel as good today as I did at 30.â€\\x9d Ronald Reagan was 69 when he became president, in 1981. Hillary Clinton will turn 69 on 26 October. The notes from Trumpâ€™s physical state that he is is 6ft 3in and 236lb, giving him a body mass index of 29.5, which is considered overweight. The businessman, who is known for eating McDonaldâ€™s, KFC and on at least one occasion a taco bowl, told Oz he would like to lose 15lb.\",\n",
              "  'Bank branch closures trigger high street alarm bells When the shutters come down on the Barclays branch in Bexley in a fortnightâ€™s time, the south-east London suburb will be left without a high street bank. Nine customers used the branch â€œregularlyâ€\\x9d over the last 12 months without interacting with the bank in any other way, Barclays told locals as it prepared for the closure, which was delayed by six months because repairs to a local bridge hindered access to the alternative branch. It is a situation repeated across the UK, as banks scramble to save costs to bolster profits just as historic low interest rates are punishing their profitability and customers migrate to smartphones and the internet to access their accounts. In Dinas Powys, just outside Cardiff, the NatWest branch is also the last remaining on the high street â€“ it would have closed in August if it were not for problems at the designated alternative branch. NatWest, which is owned by the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, pointed to a 56% fall in transactions at the branch since 2011. Local Plaid Cymru councillor Chris Franks said there were concerns for local business people â€“ not just individuals â€“ about how they can pay in cash. â€œThe irony is not lost on people that the public purse has paid a fortune for these banks and they are now abandoning taxpayers,â€\\x9d said Franks. RBS argues it reviews each branch on a case-by-case basis. About 1,500 communities have already been left without a bank on their high street, according to the Campaign for Community Banking Service (CCBS), which predicts an inexorable decline in the number of branches. One of the findings of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into high street banking competition published earlier this month, was that a branch network was no longer a barrier to entry for challengers to the â€œbig fourâ€\\x9d â€“ Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. â€œPrevious reviews have found the authorisation process for banks, the cost of IT and access to branches as barriers to entry or expansion in retail banking. We no longer find this to be the case,â€\\x9d the CMA said. Along with Santander, the big four have closed an estimated 1,700 branches in the last five years.When bailed-out Lloyds, the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland (HBOS), announced 200 unit closures last month it said use of branches had fallen by 15% year on year. Some new branches have appeared. Metro Bank was, in 2010, the first startup to open on high streets for more than a century and now has 41 branches. Both Lloyds and RBS were forced to carve out branch networks as a penalty from the EU for their taxpayer bailouts. The network created â€“ TSB â€“ is owned by Sabadell and now has 598 branches compared with 631 when it started. RBS has abandoned attempts to spin out its 300 branches of Williams & Glyn and is looking for a trade buyer. However, Age UK, the charity which works with older people, is concerned. Journeys to branches are getting longer and for some older people not ready to embrace digital, there are other consequences. â€œSmall business will also take fright of having to go long distances to a bank,â€\\x9d a spokesman for Age UK said. That could prompt an exodus of other businesses from high streets. â€œWeâ€™re asking [older] people to lead more independent lives in the community and then cutting it away,â€\\x9d the Age UK spokesman said. Last year, the industry was forced to agree to a â€œprotocolâ€\\x9d that requires them to publish impact statements with information about counter usage, regular customers and location of the nearest alternative bank, cash machine and Post Office. This is currently under review, with the outcome expected in the autumn. Nick Kennett, financial services director at the Post Office, said that when each branch closes, discussions are held about the services the Post Office can offer over its 11,500 counters. Customers of different banks at present have access to different services. He is working on a standardised service, by January, that means when each bank closes, cash withdrawals, deposit enquiries and deposit services are available for customers and small businesses to get small change. Campaigners against branch closures have long argued that branch sharing would be a solution. Derek French, who has run the CCBS since 1998, is now closing the website down. While he agrees with analysis by the consultancy CACI, cited by the CMA, that it is possible that just 600 branches will â€œdeliver effective nationwide customer coverage in five yearsâ€™ timeâ€\\x9d, he thinks there will still be a need for banking services through other outlets. The banks themselves argue that branches will remain. Barclays said: â€œThe number of physical Barclays branches will reduce overall but our branch network and the colleagues who work in them remain a vital part of our offeringâ€\\x9d.',\n",
              "  'Julie Bishop raises concerns over US foreign policy under Donald Trump Australiaâ€™s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has raised concerns about the unclear direction of US foreign policy if Donald Trump becomes president. She said the federal government had considered what a Clinton administration would mean for Australia and it knew what to expect. But if Donald Trump won the US presidency she indicated the government would have to work hard to ensure Australiaâ€™s interests were still looked after. With less than two weeks to go before the US federal election, Bishop said Trump was a â€œmuch lesser-known quantityâ€\\x9d than Hillary Clinton. â€œI believe there will be continuity in foreign policy from the Obama administration, should it be a Clinton administration. She [Clinton] sees the US as having a global leadership role,â€\\x9d Bishop told the ABCâ€™s Insiders program on Sunday. â€œCandidate Donald Trump does not. He sees the US as having got a raw deal from globalisation and he would focus more on domestic matters. â€œWe have seen Hillary Clinton, particularly as secretary of state, have a view that the US should take a leadership role in the Middle East, in hot spots around the world. She was the principal architect of the rebalance to the Asia Pacific in 2011. â€œThe US became a member of the East Asia Summit with Australia, China and others. US engagement in our region is important for us. I believe that will continue under Hillary Clinton. â€œIt will be up to our region, including Australia, to persuade a Trump administration to focus on the Asia Pacific,â€\\x9d she said. Bishop said she had met Clinton many times, and Clinton appeared to be pragmatic. She said Clinton understood Australiaâ€™s place in the world and had a deep understanding of the US-Australia alliance. â€œDonald Trump is a much lesser known quantity, as far as Australia is concerned,â€\\x9d she said. â€œHe doesnâ€™t have a record in government; in public office. We are looking closely at the policy pronouncements he has made.â€\\x9d In February Trump said he wanted to shrink the American presence in Asia and charge allies billions of dollars for protection, complaining â€œrichâ€\\x9d countries like Japan and South Korea had been freeloading on the US and the US was getting little in return. â€œWeâ€™re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWeâ€™re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.â€\\x9d Bishop said Australia would also be monitoring carefully comments from the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte. She said Duterte recently â€œraised eyebrowsâ€\\x9d when he told Chinese officials that he wanted to separate from the US, but had clarified his comments to say he was only talking about pursuing an independent foreign policy from the United States, which she said was not a remarkable statement. â€œThere will be concerns if he does seek to distance the Philippines from the United States because the United States has been the principal security guarantor for our region and many nations, including the Philippines, and Australia has benefited enormously from the US presence,â€\\x9d Bishop said. â€œHe has gone on to say that in Japan he would like to see US troops leave but that he is not going to break any agreements at this point. We will monitor his statements carefully.â€\\x9d Last month Bishop met with Trumpâ€™s campaign team in the US and said she had been assured Australia was a â€œclose and strong ally of the United Statesâ€\\x9d. After the meeting, she said from Australiaâ€™s point of view the alliance would hold up under a Trump presidency. â€œI am confident that whomever the American people in their wisdom choose to be president, there will be an ongoing strong connection with Australia,â€\\x9d she said.',\n",
              "  'The view on Brexit and the Lords: power to examine A protocol of British democracy is that the House of Lords shows humility in recognition that its members are not elected, in exchange for which the Commons retains a degree of deference to the ancient pedigree of the upper house. This arrangement, underpinned by convention and statute, is tested whenever peers thwart some cherished government ambition. Such protocols did not prevent the Lords from sabotaging George Osborneâ€™s plans to cut tax credits last year. David Cameronâ€™s government threatened to retaliate with legislation making curtailment of peer power more explicit. Theresa Mayâ€™s government has now suspended that threat but with a proviso. Baroness Evans, leader of the Lords, has warned her upper house colleagues that they must exhibit â€œdiscipline and self-regulationâ€\\x9d, especially where scrutiny of Brexit is concerned. She is right that unelected peers would be unwise to adopt a wrecking stance towards a policy mandated by popular vote in the referendum. But there is no sign that the Lords have wholly obstructive intent, and they do have a right of critical engagement. An undertaking to comply with the prime ministerâ€™s Brexit timetable is not one the Lords can reasonably give, nor one that government should seek.',\n",

It was only last month that the bourbon brand announced the Oscar-winning star had signed a multi-year deal to â€œserve as the chief storyteller for Wild Turkey both behind the camera and in front of itâ€\\x9d. I wouldnâ€™t like to hazard how much Wild Turkey Matthew had in him to make the following statement, but itâ€™s good to learn how much of Matthew there seems to be in Wild Turkey. â€œWild Turkey has the history and qualities of a brand that depicts the dedication of someone to do something their own way,â€\\x9d he announced solemnly, â€œeven if that way isnâ€™t always the most popular.â€\\x9d Well quite. This is a bourbon still prickly about having spent most of the noughties imprisoned in second-tier romcoms with Kate Hudson, or defending its naked bongo-playing arrest. And so to Matthewâ€™s first commercial distillation of the brand, which is unlikely to win any prizes for originality, given that it opens with him drawling â€œWeâ€™re not in a rush to be most popular â€¦â€\\x9d Well, of course not. It is, after all, an immutable advertising law that dictates this type of hard liquor must always be styled as the laconic choice, the laidback choice, the almost insufferably slow-moving choice. And yet, as anyone who has ever had a proper night on the stuff will tell you, this could scarcely be more at odds with the user experience. The one thing you can bet your pickup truck on is that theyâ€™re sweeping up teeth come chucking-out time in Jack Daniels Hollow, where a mere naked bongo arrest must surely be regarded as having had a quiet one.',\n",
              "  'The view on the American presidential election It was a week when the 2016 American presidential election appeared to boil down to a contest between two individuals: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Both candidates achieved sweeping victories across the Super Tuesday states. Both immediately began to adjust their campaign rhetoric to better suit Novemberâ€™s national election, with an emphasis on inclusiveness and unity. In Trumpâ€™s case, however, this feigned switch towards moderation and bonhomie was short lived. By the weekâ€™s end, he was again insulting his rivals and almost unbelievably, given what is at stake, bragging about the size of his penis. It is true that forthcoming primaries in Florida, Ohio and elsewhere could upset projections of a Trump-Clinton showdown. It is still theoretically possible that Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz could somehow deny Trump the Republican nomination, even though they lag far behind in party polls. It would take a miracle for Bernie Sanders, the fireside socialist from what Time columnist Joe Klein calls New Englandâ€™s â€œlatte landsâ€\\x9d, to overhaul Clinton, but miracles do sometimes happen. And such is the hostility to Trump within the Republican hierarchy, an old-fashioned brokered (meaning manipulated) convention in Cleveland in July, fixed to deny him his partyâ€™s crown, cannot be ruled out. But these are all implausible scenarios. Barring accidents or other unforeseen events, American voters seem stuck with a choice few foresaw a year ago. Whereas Clinton was always hot favourite to succeed Barack Obama and lead her party in the autumn, Trump, a rank outsider who has never held political office, has come from nowhere to seize the spotlight, headlines and votes. Yet is this really as unusual as some commentators believe? US elections have a long history of producing unconventional, sometimes unpleasant anti-establishment candidates whose allure eclipses the professional political class. Strip away, if you can, Trumpâ€™s boorishness and gross insensitivity to complex issues such as the westâ€™s relationship with Islam and his iconoclastic, insurgent campaign does not look or sound very different from those waged by maverick rightwingers such as Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot in the 1990s. Nor, historically speaking, is his lack of experience a bar to the highest office. Non-politicians Dwight Eisenhower and Ulysses Grant both won the presidency thanks to their reputations as successful generals. Herbert Hoover, like Trump a wealthy businessman, was elected in 1928 for his supposed financial acumen. Hapless Hoover also promised to â€œmake America great againâ€\\x9d. Instead, the Wall Street Crash a few months later triggered the Great Depression. Given Trumpâ€™s ignorant views on immigration and his appeal among grassroots voters, defined as white, Protestant, working-class people lacking a college degree, a more exact precedent is found in the activities of the Know Nothing party, also known as the American party, in the early 1850s. The Know Nothings exploited public fears about unchecked immigration, promising to â€œpurifyâ€\\x9d society by halting the influx of Irish and German Catholics whom they claimed were secretly controlled by the pope. Know-nothing Trumpâ€™s verbal sparring with Pope Francis over Mexican border walls provides an intriguing echo of that time. Yet past experience does nothing to diminish the present-day anger and disillusionment of many American voters with the modern political establishment and the way things are now. This discontent is very real and very urgent. Understanding it, articulating it and, most importantly, acting to both satisfy and channel it in positive ways represents the biggest challenge for Trump and Clinton. But from where does this anger come? Is it simply that Washingtonâ€™s so-called elite are out of touch, that Congress is log-jammed and impotent and Obama is a discredited lame duck? Or is there a bigger, deeper cause of this malaise that any president would struggle to remedy? It would seem so. The unpalatable truth confronting Americans, if they care to face up to it (and many do not), is that their country, for so long regarded by them as unquestionably the foremost and best among nations, is under unprecedented pressure. Militarily, the US remains the worldâ€™s most powerful state. Yet it cannot or will not stop a resurgent Russia thumbing its nose at the west in Ukraine, Syria and the Baltic. In the South China Sea, another upstart rival, China, builds multiple island military bases with nonchalant impunity. In the Middle East, the sons of those same insurgents who resisted the 2003 Iraq invasion and swore allegiance to al-Qaida now fly the black banners of Islamic State, tearing up international human rights law, threatening civilian lives in every European and Arab capital and making a mockery of the post-Cold War pax Americana. At home, global forces beyond the control of any White House incumbent undermine the job security, pay and pensions of American workers once inured to international competition. The US national debt, estimated at a whopping $19.1tn, is in fact much higher. The government has pledged an astounding $41.9tn in social security and other retiree benefits over the next 75 years, money it simply does not have and will not receive on current revenue projections. That amounts to a total debt of $61tn, equivalent to more than three times US gross domestic product, much of it underwritten abroad. American society meanwhile continues to transform rapidly in myriad ways. Gone are the old, Germanic-inspired certainties of kitchen, church and country. No longer can violence against black people and other minorities, powerfully symbolised by police shootings, be quietly ignored. As Obamaâ€™s watershed election in 2008 foretold, in the making is a more integrated, more multiracial, multi-confessional, sexually liberated and politically diverse America than ever existed before. The wonderful irony is that the idea of the melting pot, for so long more myth than daily fact of life, seems finally to be coming into being. The bigger question for 2016â€™s voters, therefore, is not about Trump or Clinton, Republican or Democrat. It is about how to manage a changing, less homogenous, less wealthy and less dominant America in a highly competitive, often chaotic and dangerous 21st-century world. The American nation is living beyond its means at home and increasingly failing to project its will and interests abroad. This is a serious moment, perhaps even a turning point, as the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, suggests. The appalling Trump, in particular, must understand this. Bragging, bluster and bullying do not cut it. At this critical hour, America needs leadership.',\n",
              "  'Premier League, Football League and European football: clockwatch â€“ as it happened Thatâ€™s it from me; here are some match reports to help you make sense of this afternoonâ€™s action. Donâ€™t forget to join Rob Smyth for Arsenal v Norwich. That should be fun. Cheerio! Premier League Newcastle are out of the bottom three with 33 points Sunderland are a point behind with a game in hand West Ham are up to fifth, five points off Arsenal in fourth Championship Sheffield Wednesday join Derby and Hull in the play-offs League One Wigan are promoted from League One after beating Blackpool Burton need a point to guarantee promotion to the second tier Doncaster are all but down after 3-1 defeat at Crewe Blackpool and Fleetwood will fight to avoid last relegation place League Two Accrington, Oxford and Bristol Rovers still in the promotion race Plymouth, Portsmouth and Wimbledon are all in the play-offs Drama at Moor Lane, where Salford City scored twice in the last ten minutes to beat Workington 3-2, seal promotion to the Conference North, and finally restore a smile to Gary Nevilleâ€™s face. Championship Brentford 3-0 Fulham Bristol City 4-0 Huddersfield Ipswich 3-2 MK Dons Leeds Utd 1-2 Charlton Nottingham Forest 1-1 Wolves Reading 1-2 Preston Rotherham 0-1 Blackburn Sheffield Wednesday 3-0 Cardiff League One Barnsley 2-2 Colchester Burton 2-1 Gillingham Chesterfield 3-0 Bury Coventry 3-1 Sheffield Utd Crewe 2-1 Doncaster (latest) Millwall 3-0 Oldham Rochdale 2-2 Swindon Scunthorpe 1-0 Port Vale Shrewsbury 3-4 Peterborough Southend 0-1 Bradford City League Two Barnet 3-4 Yeovil (!) Cambridge 2-2 Plymouth Carlisle 0-2 Oxford Dagenham & Redbridge 3-0 Crawley Exeter 1-1 Morecambe Hartlepool 0-2 Portsmouth Leyton Orient 1-0 Mansfield Newport 0-1 Notts County Northampton 2-0 Luton Stevenage 0-0 Wimbledon Wycombe 0-1 Accrington York 1-4 Bristol Rovers Everton 2-1 Bournemouth Newcastle 1-0 Crystal Palace Stoke 1-1 Sunderland Watford 3-2 Aston Villa West Brom 0-3 West Ham Sheffield Wednesday are in the play-offs after beating Cardiff 3-0 at Hillsborough, while Luke Varney has grabbed a late winner for Ipswich. Burton are on the verge of promotion after beating Gillingham 2-1, while Tom Lapslie has scored a last-gasp equaliser for Colchester at Oakwell. The Uâ€™s are already down, and had a forward in nets for the last ten minutes, so thatâ€™s impressive. At Crewe, Doncaster have around 20 minutes to realistically save themselves from the drop. Everton win, but there are plenty of banners up around Goodison Park calling for Roberto MartÃ\\xadnez to go. Leighton Baines got the winner in the second half. All over at the Hawthorns, where West Ham keep their top four push alive thanks to two goals from Mark Noble, and one for Cheikhou KouyatÃ©. An Andros Townsend free kick, and a Karl Darlow penalty save from Yohan Cabaye, earn Newcastle a vital victory. Bryan Graham has more. Quite the game at the New Meadow, where Shrewsbury rallied from 3-0 down to level, only to slip 4-3 behind at the death. Now theyâ€™ve had Ian Black sent off. In League Two, itâ€™s finished Cambridge 2-2 Plymouth; the visitors will be in the play-offs, Cambridge will not. Villa snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, as Troy Deeney scores two stoppage-time goals to earn a useful win for Quique Sanchez Flores. Jermain Defoe wins and scores an injury-time penalty to earn a precious point for Sunderland. A Gareth Bale header settles a scrappy game, and Real are back on top in La Liga, for a couple of hours. Come on now, this isnâ€™t fair. Troy Deeney strikes again to earn Watford victory, and somehow make Villaâ€™s season worse. Scenes at the Pirelli Stadium, where Tom Naylor has put Burton 2-1 up in the 92nd minute! Iâ€™m so sorry, Villa fans. Troy Deeney nods a Berghuis cross into the net to equalise in stoppage time. Defoe takes an age to place the ball, then smashes it home to grab a point for Sunderland! Oh boy. Geoff Cameron brings down Defoe, who gets up to take the penalty... Real Madrid have a free kick to defend in added time, but Keylor Navas gets both hands to a near-post header. That should do it... At Stoke, Seb Larsson fires a free kick over, and Sunderlandâ€™s frustrations boil over, with a couple of minor skirmishes breaking out. Theyâ€™re running out of time, as are Doncaster, who have gone behind at bottom club Crewe. If they lose, theyâ€™re as good as down. It gets worse for Plymouth, with James Spencer putting the hosts ahead, two minutes after their equaliser. That goal could keep Cambridge in the hunt for a play-off place themselves. Big goals crash in at Oakwell â€“ where Barnsley lead 2-1 â€“ and the Abbey Stadium, where Cambridge have equalised against Plymouth. That could condemn Plymouth to the play-offs. In the Championship, Stephen Quinn has equalised for Reading at home to Preston, in a game theyâ€™re racing to get over and done with. Ten minutes to go in the Premier League. Can Sunderland level? Will Newcastle hang on? Are Everton about to win at home? Weâ€™re about to find out. League Two news: itâ€™s York 1-3 Bristol Rovers, and Accrington finally have the lead at Wycombe. All of the top six are winning, while thereâ€™s a cracker at Barnet, where Yeovil have just made it 3-3. Your thoughts â€œGareth Bale redeems himself with a header Ã  la Andy Carroll. Must be the topknotâ€\\x9d says Charles Antaki. â€œToooooooon!â€\\x9d bellows Sam Huscroft. The captain gets his second of the day, turning home Andy Carrollâ€™s chipped pass. You know what to do, Roy... A big goal in La Liga, as Gareth Bale gets it right this time to head a Lucas Vasquez cross into the top corner! Alex Revell gets his second, and itâ€™s inevitably Ipswich 2-2 MK Dons in a game between two sides who canâ€™t buy a win. And Sheffield Wednesday are bound for the playoffs, as Gary Hooper robs David Marshall of the ball and crosses, with Cardiffâ€™s Lee Peltier applying the unfortunate finishing touch. Oxford lead Carlisle 2-0, but they wonâ€™t be going up today â€“ Bristol Rovers lead 2-0 at York, and Plymouth lead at Cambridge. In League One, Shrewsbury needed a win to secure survival. Theyâ€™ve failed miserably, losing 3-1 at home to Peterborough. It had all been going too well for Aston Villa, and after Anya is put clear by Ben Watson, Cissokho brings him down with his trailing leg, and is sent packing by Anthony Taylor. Jackie Milburn, Alan Shearer... Karl Darlow. The understudy keeper denies Cabaye, and Newcastle stay in the lead. Moussa Sissoko handles from a Palace corner, and former Newcastle hero Yohan Cabaye is going to take it... Bristol City lead 3-0 over Huddersfield, Jonathan Kodjia with his second goal. Elsewhere in the Championship, Ipswich lead MK Dons 2-1 through Brett Pitman, and Forest have equalised against Wolves. No title for Bayern today, as Gladbach hold them to a 1-1 draw. Theyâ€™re five points clear of Dortmund with two games remaining. Eintracht Frankfurt are out of the bottom two, with Werder Bremen dropping into danger. Bayern 1-1 Gladbach Darmstadt 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt Dortmund 5-1 Wolfsburg Hannover 1-3 Schalke Hoffenheim 2-1 Ingolstadt Mainz 0-0 Hamburg â€œSunderlandâ€™s own Thomas MÃ¼ller has not scored yet but I am sure he is working hardâ€\\x9d honks Ian Copestake. Fabio Borini has now gone off, unappreciated once again. Big goal at Hillsborough, where Gary Hooper has put Sheffield Wednesday ahead, tucking away the rebound after Pudilâ€™s shot was saved. The hosts set for the play-offs alongside Hull, Derby and whoever finishes third. Leighton Baines puts Everton back ahead, placing an Aaron Lennon pull-back into the top corner with aplomb. Joe Mason puts Wolves a goal up at Nottingham Forest, while in League One, Barnsley equalise at home to Colchester. Thank me later, Newcastle fans. Andros Townsend puts the hosts ahead from a free kick! Bryan Graham has more. â€œGareth Bale has just missed not one sitter, but two in short order against Real Sociedad. Adopts the hands-behind-head plus anguished-distant-gaze appropriate to such occasionsâ€\\x9d reports Charles Antaki. He also looked for an offside flag to help him out â€“ absolutely textbook. Can Newcastle take advantage of Sunderland going behind? Theyâ€™re struggling at the moment. Get the latest with Bryan Graham. Itâ€™s a (relatively) good afternoon so far for teams already down: Bolton have won, Villa are winning, as are Charlton, Colchester lead at Barnsley, Crewe have equalised against Doncaster, and Dagenham & Redbridge lead Crawley 2-0. Hereâ€™s J.A. Hopkin with a fair point: Letâ€™s talk about how the other three Championsâ€™ League semi-finalists are playing today, but the FA and Sky Sports would not allow Man City to move tomorrow eveningâ€™s match away at Southampton to a Saturday kick-off. Howâ€™s that for supporting our home clubs in Europe? Manuel Pellegrini certainly isnâ€™t happy: West Brom offering no threat to West Ham, with Andy Carroll coming closest to scoring in the second half. Hard lines for Spurs fans... Two big goals in the Bundesliga relegation race â€“ Eintracht Frankfurt lead at Darmstadt, and Hoffenheim lead 2-1 at home to Ingolstadt. Elsewhere, Dortmund are sending a message to Mats Hummels â€“ theyâ€™re now 5-0 up over Wolfsburg. Gillingham grab an equaliser at Burton through Cody McDonald. If it stays like that, Wigan will be champions, and Burton will be nervous. In the Championship, Ademola Lookman has doubled Charltonâ€™s lead at Leeds. Grim news for Sunderland fans, Marco Arnautovic bullying Lamine Kone off the ball and firing Stoke into the lead. Aston Villa freewheeling at Vicarage Road, retaking the lead through Jordan Ayew, who fires a low shot beyond the grasp of Heurelho Gomes. Well then â€“ Gladbach have equalised through Andre Hahn, and Bayernâ€™s party is on hold. Weâ€™ve also got news from Crewe v Doncaster â€“ donâ€™t go thinking weâ€™ve gone all continental on you. Itâ€™s 1-0 to Doncaster, who look set to keep their survival bid on track. Real Madrid fail to make a first-half breakthrough in a dull 45 minutes at the Anoeta. Championship A couple of late goals, with Jonathan Kodjia putting Bristol City ahead, and Alex Revell equalising for MK Dons. Brentford 3-0 Fulham Bristol City 1-0 Huddersfield Ipswich 1-1 MK Dons Leeds Utd 0-1 Charlton Nottingham Forest 0-0 Wolves Reading 0-0 Preston Rotherham 0-1 Blackburn Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Cardiff League One Barnsley 0-1 Colchester Burton 1-0 Gillingham Chesterfield 2-0 Bury Coventry 2-0 Sheffield Utd Crewe 0-0 Doncaster (3.30 k/o) Millwall 2-0 Oldham Rochdale 1-2 Swindon Scunthorpe 0-0 Port Vale Shrewsbury 0-1 Peterborough Southend 0-1 Bradford City League Two Barnet 1-0 Yeovil Cambridge 0-0 Plymouth Carlisle 0-1 Oxford Dagenham & Redbridge 0-0 Crawley Exeter 0-0 Morecambe Hartlepool 0-0 Portsmouth Leyton Orient 0-0 Mansfield Newport 0-1 Notts County Northampton 2-0 Luton Stevenage 0-0 Wimbledon Wycombe 0-0 Accrington York 0-1 Bristol Rovers Everton 1-1 Bournemouth Newcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace Stoke 0-0 Sunderland Watford 1-1 Aston Villa West Brom 0-2 West Ham KouyatÃ© turns provider, teeing up Mark Noble who toe-pokes the ball into the bottom corner to put West Ham very much on top. Almen Abdi spoils Villaâ€™s party, equalising on the stroke of half-time with a fine free kick. Granit Xhaka curls a shot just wide of Manuel Neuerâ€™s far post, with Bayern still just a goal up. Dortmund keep up the pressure, Marco Reus making it 3-0 over Wolfsburg. Hope for Frankfurt, as Makoto Hasebe equalises at Darmstadt. Burton take the lead over Gillingham, Lucas Akins with the goal. Victory would put them six points and at least five goals ahead of Walsall, with two games remaining for the Saddlers. Millwall in fourth are 2-0 up over Oldham, but thatâ€™s no use unless Burton lose. Relegated Charlton lead Leeds 1-0 at Elland Road, in a match that Iâ€™ll wager is lacking a party atmosphere. At Goodison Park, Ross Barkley is trying to make something happen, but fires a shot into Stanley Park from a good position. â€œMy local team, Eintracht Frankfurt, seem to be doomedâ€\\x9d says Ian Copestake, who likes to spread his allegiances around. â€œFootball God Alexander Meier needs to channel his inner Jay Jay Okochaâ€\\x9d. Frankfurt are still a goal down at Darmstadt, and the marvellous Meier is set for a spell of being undervalued at a Premier League contender. Hereâ€™s our report from Bloomfield Road, where Wigan returned to the Championship in style, and Blackpool slid closer to League Two; they were in the Premier League five years ago. â€œThere appears to be some mistake,â€\\x9d says Chris Drew. â€œYouâ€™ve got Aston Villa as scoring a goal. And even more unbelievable, theyâ€™re in the lead.â€\\x9d Dimitri Payet collects the ball out on the right, and delivers a superb cross for Chiekhou KouyatÃ© to nod the Hammers in front. Real Sociedad enjoy a spell of pressure, with Sergio Ramos of all people conceding a clumsy free kick â€“ but two forwards get in each otherâ€™s way. One early goal in the Championship that passed me by: Blackburn lead Rotherham 1-0 through Shane Duffy. In League Two, Bristol Rovers lead at York, and Barnet are a goal up over Yeovil. In Scotland, Aberdeen arenâ€™t giving up the title today, and theyâ€™re working on the 39-goal swing, leading 2-0 over Motherwell. Surprise! Ciaran Clark gets his head to a corner and nods Villa into the lead! They havenâ€™t won away from home since August. Ben Watson hits the bar with an outrageous volley from distance, while at the Hawthorns, Jonathan Leko is lighting things up in an otherwise quiet game. David McGoldrick has put Ipswich a goal up against relegated MK Dons, while Sheffield Wednesday are knocking on the door against Cardiff. In San Sebastian, Gareth Bale flashes another header wide, the Welshman leading the line with Benzema and Ronaldo out today. â€œAre Leicester City going to party like its 1999 (see below), Manchester Unitedâ€™s treble winning year, when Manchester United, like Leicester City, only lost three matches during the Premier League season?â€\\x9d asks Raymond Reardon (presumably not that one). Letâ€™s not talk about Leicester. You want to, I want to, but... ah, what the hey, letâ€™s talk about Leicester. Peter Crouch flicks on Charlie Adamâ€™s cross, but Marco Arnautovic canâ€™t get their ahead of Mannone, before Kone throws himself in front of a Shaqiri shot. Nothing to trouble the scoreboard here, or at Newcastle, Watford and West Brom. At the Anoeta, Gareth Bale has planted a header just wide as Real Madrid search for an opener. Hereâ€™s the Bundesliga half times; Bayern are 45 minutes from the title. Bayern 1-0 Gladbach Darmstadt 1-0 Eintracht Frankfurt Dortmund 2-0 Wolfsburg Hannover 1-2 Schalke Hoffenheim 1-1 Ingolstadt Mainz 0-0 Hamburger SV Watford all over Aston Villa in the early stages, with the off-colour Odion Ighalo missing a couple of chances. In League One, Bradford lead at Southend, while in Scotland, Kilmarnock lead at Hamilton, pushing Dundee United closer to the drop. Itâ€™s a big day for Salford City â€“ theyâ€™re up against Workington in the Northern Premier League playoff final, seeking elevation to the Conference North. Itâ€™s 1-1 after 15 minutes at Moor Lane. Fulham and Sheffield United fans, time to go out and enjoy the sunshine. Fulham are 2-0 down at Brentford, the Blades behind by the same score at Coventry. It takes a while to be officially given, but Marc Pugh turns Callum Wilson in off Matthew Pennington to level immediately. Boos from the crowd over a potential push in the build-up. Tom Cleverley gives the hosts a welcome lead, firing into the bottom of the corner from the edge of the area. Early goals in Leagues One & Two: Oxford lead at Carlisle with promotion in sight, while Northampton lead Luton through Zander Diamond. The champions will get their hands on the trophy at full-time, as my colleague Dan Lucas keeps reminding me. More Hillsborough tributes at St. Jamesâ€™ Park: â€œRafa has made Newcastle my second team. The fans have just cranked out a thrilling rendition of Youâ€™ll Never Walk Alone. Wonderful to see this in footballâ€\\x9d says Ian Copestake. I feel a little discombobulated after that emotional Everton tribute, but letâ€™s press on with the football. All games are under way. At Goodison Park, a number of Hillsborough victimsâ€™ relatives are on the pitch, while the PA plays â€œHe Ainâ€™t Heavy, Heâ€™s My Brotherâ€\\x9d. During a minuteâ€™s applause, a banner is unfurled, it reads â€œJustice at Last 96 â€“ Brothers in Armsâ€\\x9d. â€œDue to unforeseen circumstances, that is, a win for Kilmarnock at Hamilton today, followed by a defeat for Dundee United at Dens on Monday, todayâ€™s Scottish football update has been cancelled. Sorryâ€\\x9d sobs Simon McMahon. â€œBut for anybody still interested itâ€™s still quite exciting in the race for the Championship play offs between Falkirk and Hibs, and the bottom of League One between Cowdenbeath, Brechin and Stenhousemuir.â€\\x9d Simon is too depressed to mention Celtic, who have beaten Hearts 3-1 at Tynecastle. They will be confirmed as champions if Aberdeen fail to beat Motherwell, but the Dons need four wins, three Celtic defeats and a 39-goal swing. You can forgive Celtic for celebrating early. Roberts is on the bench at the Hawthorns today, and PÃªl-droed is probably my favourite word for football in another language. Thomas MÃ¼ller has put Bayern 1-0 up early on in Munich. Dortmund, as usual, are chasing gamely â€“ theyâ€™re already 2-0 up in Wolfsburg, Shinji Kagawa and Adrian Ramos with the goals. Football League fixtures Championship Brentford v Fulham Bristol City v Huddersfield Ipswich v MK Dons Leeds Utd v Charlton Nottingham Forest v Wolves Reading v Preston Rotherham v Blackburn Sheffield Wednesday v Cardiff It finished Bolton 1-0 Hull in the early game; the visitors not exactly picking up speed as the play-offs approach. League One Barnsley v Colchester Burton v Gillingham Chesterfield v Bury Coventry v Sheffield Utd Crewe v Doncaster Millwall v Oldham Rochdale v Swindon Scunthorpe v Port Vale Shrewsbury v Peterborough Southend v Bradford City League Two Barnet v Yeovil Cambridge v Plymouth Carlisle v Oxford Dagenham & Redbridge v Crawley Exeter v Morecambe Hartlepool v Portsmouth Leyton Orient v Mansfield Newport v Notts County Northampton v Luton Stevenage v Wimbledon Wycombe v Accrington York v Bristol Rovers Wigan are promoted from League One after thrashing Blackpool 4-0 at Bloomfield Road. Itâ€™s straight back to Championship business for them. The Latics will be crowned champions if Burton fail to win today; victory for the Brewers over Gillingham would, more pressingly, put them on the edge of a first-ever season in the second tier. That canâ€™t be confirmed until Monday, when Walsall play Fleetwood. That also spares Blackpool for today, while Doncaster need a win at rock-bottom Crewe. Chesterfield and Shrewsbury can seal survival with victories over Bury and Peterborough respectively. With Middlesbrough drawing at Birmingham last night, and both Burnley and Brighton playing on Monday, thereâ€™s only issue to address in todayâ€™s Championship games. Sheffield Wednesday host Cardiff, knowing that a draw will seal a play-off place. In League Two, Accrington and Oxford could both go up today with victories, providing that Bristol Rovers and Plymouth stumble. Oxford are looking to return to the third tier after 15 years away; Stanley last played at that level in 1960. Defeat for Plymouth at Cambridge could keep the play-off race alive, with the Uâ€™s battling Wimbledon for the final place. Thereâ€™s more on all the possible ups and downs here. In La Liga, Real Madrid can return to the summit for a couple of hours with a win at Real Sociedad, who havenâ€™t won in their three games since beating Barcelona. Itâ€™s a clash between two of Spainâ€™s all-time big six: Real Madrid lead the way with 32 La Liga titles, their Basque opponents are sixth, with a whopping two. In Germany, Bayern are ready to make history; victory over Moenchengladbach would seal a first ever Bundesliga four-peat. Gladbach are in the race for fourth, and defeat will give Mainz and Schalke the chance to catch up, with current incumbents Hertha Berlin playing in-form Leverkusen later. At the bottom, Eintracht Frankfurt can boost their survival chances with a win at Darmstadt. In Ligue 1, Nice look set to miss out on ending a 56-year wait to return to the European elite; theyâ€™re 1-0 down at Nantes, chasing Lyon and Monaco for a top-three spot. At the Hawthorns, talented teenager Jonathan Leko makes his first Premier League start a week after his sixteenth birthday. Heâ€™s the first top-flight player born in 1999, which is a good enough reason for me: Bobby rolls those dice, with January signing Oumar Niasse starting ahead of Romelu Lukaku up front, and youngster Matthew Pennington in central defence. For Bournemouth, Callum Wilson starts for the first time since September. Everton v Bournemouth Everton: Howard, Besic, Stones, Pennington, Baines, McCarthy, Gibson, Lennon, Barkley, Cleverley, Niasse. Subs: Robles, Hibbert, Oviedo, Lukaku, Mirallas, Osman, Hassan.

Subs: Guzan, Richards, Sinclair, Veretout, SÃ¡nchez, Gil, Grealish. Referee: Anthony Taylor They told me that the classics never go out of style but they do, they do. Itâ€™s been a tough old season for the top flightâ€™s established elite, and it could still end with Newcastle and Sunderland joining Aston Villa in dropping out. That would leave a top division without those three giants for the first time ever. Ever? Ever. Newcastle host Alan Pardewâ€™s Crystal Palace (join Bryan Graham for that one), while Sunderland travel to summertime Stoke; the sort of fixtures one might hand pick in their situation, but on the flip side, games where defeat will leave either club with that sinking feeling. Another top-flight heavyweight could be about to end a record run; Everton havenâ€™t sacked a manager since 2002, but unless Roberto MartÃ\\xadnez can summon a fifth home win of the season against Bournemouth, it could be curtains. The reverse fixture, a 3-3 draw Everton refused to win, may go down as the MartÃ\\xadnez Yearsâ€™ defining moment. Another manager on the brink is Quique SÃ nchez Flores, reportedly set to be sacked by the ungrateful swines at Watford, with a first top-ten finish in 30 years still on the table. If they canâ€™t beat Aston Villa at home today, his departure could be inevitable, and almost forgivable. There are no such worries for fellow newcomer Slaven Bilic, who still harbours dreams of leading West Ham to a first ever Champions League place. West Bromâ€™s Tony Pulis will be looking forward to wrapping those dreams in a club shop scarf, and smashing them with a hammer. Thereâ€™s history to be made in Europe, the Football League and beyond too. Plenty to enjoy without even mentioning Leicester. Ah. Sorry. Team news to follow.

              "  'Cambridge University names Canadian academic as next vice-chancellor A Canadian expert in international law has been chosen as the next vice-chancellor of Cambridge university following a global search for a leader to navigate the Brexit-related challenges facing higher education. Prof Stephen Toope, who is director of the University of Torontoâ€™s Munk school of global affairs, will replace Sir Leszek Borysiewicz in October next year, following formal approval by the universityâ€™s governing body. He takes over one of the biggest jobs in higher education at a time when UK universities are facing unprecedented uncertainty in the wake of the referendum vote to leave the EU, as well as wide-ranging changes to funding and regulation. Toope will be required to build on Cambridgeâ€™s international reputation amid fierce competition in the global higher education market, particularly from established universities in the US and emerging institutions in Asia. Earlier this month, the QS world university rankings were published in which Cambridge fell out of the top three for the first time in 12 years, as other UK institutions slightly deteriorated in performance. Last week, arch rival Oxford was named the best university in the world in the Times Higher Education (THE) world university rankings â€“ the first time an institution from the UK has topped the THE rankings. Cambridge came fourth. The new vice-chancellorâ€™s brief is demanding. As well as advancing the universityâ€™s profile on the international stage, he will have to modernise an ageing estate, some of which has been reportedly described as â€œhistoric sites barely fit for purposeâ€\\x9d. Borysiewicz recently outlined the challenge facing Cambridge post-Brexit when he told MPs that the university had the largest number of awards from the EU of any institution in Europe, let alone the UK. â€œThe total financial sum is in the order of Â£100m, so the impact is quite significant in financial terms.â€\\x9d While the government has provided some reassurance in the short term, Borysiewicz expressed concern about future EU students coming to the UK and the disquiet among the 19% of staff at Cambridge who are EU nationals and still do not know what the future holds. Toope, a scholar specialising in human rights, international dispute resolution, environmental law and the use of force, was previously vice-chancellor of the University of British Columbia. He graduated from Harvard in 1979 and completed his PhD at Trinity College Cambridge. He was also on the UN working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances from 2002 to 2007. He said: â€œI am thrilled to be returning to this great university. I look forward to working with staff and students in the pursuit of academic excellence and tremendous international engagement â€“ the very mark of Cambridge.â€\\x9d Borysiewicz said: â€œWe are delighted to be welcoming a distinguished leader with such an outstanding record as a scholar and educator to lead Cambridge.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Stop worrying about fake news. What comes next will be much worse In my exploration of â€œfake newsâ€\\x9d, Iâ€™ve found some troubling things. And itâ€™s not just the rightwing news network thatâ€™s worrying. Iâ€™ve recently gone back and taken a preliminary look at the leftwing media ecosystem, trying to map the hyperlinks between these sites â€“ so Iâ€™m not trying to establish causation or assign blame as to what kinds of content these sites circulate. There are plenty of other people willing to do that. What Iâ€™m really looking for is a way forward. Iâ€™m primarily interested in the larger network that has enabled fake news to become such a salient topic. What Iâ€™ve found most troubling about fake news so far isnâ€™t the factual errors, the misinformation, or the propaganda involved. Itâ€™s not the politics either . And no, itâ€™s not Trump. Whatâ€™s scary about fake news is how it is becoming a catch-all phrase for anything people happen to disagree with. In this regard, fake news is sort of the stepbrother of â€œpost-factâ€\\x9d and â€œpost-truthâ€\\x9d â€“ though not directly related, theyâ€™re all part of the same dysfunctional family. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have been accused of being responsible for the result of the US election, the Brexit referendum outcome or events such as Pizzagate â€“ which led Hillary Clinton this week to describe fake news as â€œa danger that must be addressedâ€\\x9d. The worst part of this debate has been obscured by politics-as-usual, techno-dystopian Fahrenheit 451 tropes â€“ and to some degree, more misinformation. Reality bytes Did the sequence of events leading up to the 4 December #Pizzagate incident in Washington, DC mark the point when fake news became real? I think not. Fake news has been real since weâ€™ve had the capability to communicate language and tell stories. Itâ€™s an unfortunate reality that news reporting is often at odds with the interest trifecta of politics, profits, and public opinion. Whatâ€™s changed is the internet, which has altered the scale of the fake news problem, taking it to another level. While fake news might have been less visible in the past, it has always been with us. Where we might find Twitter bots today, weâ€™ll find AI-powered virtual assistants and ubiquitous natural language interfaces (ie, Alexa, Siri, and Google Home) tomorrow. Fake news will be our virtual friend In some ways, weâ€™ve already arrived. Is it fake news when Google Maps fails to provide us with the fastest route to a destination? Do we cry â€œfake newsâ€\\x9d when a deceptive review on Amazon influences our decision to buy an inferior product? What about when we go back after a negative experience and discover biased reviews on Yelp? Fake news is more about what we can confirm as real than what we can identify as fake. News is the fabric that weaves together our realities, and Google, Facebook, Twitter â€“ through always-on phone screens, activity trackers, and 24/7 GPS and indoor Bluetooth trails â€“ represents our interface with this brave new world. As global technology companies move forward with solutions to protect us â€“ and their advertising revenue â€“ from the scourge that is fake news, they must ensure that the smaller, less visible, alternative news outlets are not caught in their operational cleansing. Independent media that seek to distribute their own news content are already challenged by premium content delivery systems such as Facebookâ€™s Instant, 360 (Video), and Googleâ€™s AMP. The industryâ€™s filtering response to fake news could signal the end of legitimate news outlets that make an effort to draw attention to issues they feel are underrepresented or intentionally suppressed by the mainstream media. The new(s) pornographers Fake news is a lot like pornography â€“ especially in terms of how gatekeepers classify certain content (and known sources of content) they deem unsuitable for their audiences. Take, for instance, the Pulitzer prizewinning Vietnam war photo removed from Facebook. If a combination of human and machine detection has difficulty differentiating between child pornography and Vietnam war images, wait until we start pre-filtering (ie, preferentially censoring) news based on issue-based framing and community self-reporting. Fake news has certainly been attracting attention, including that of national policymakers. Marsha Blackburn, an American congresswoman, has gone so far as to imply that internet service providers should be held responsible for taking down fake news, saying: â€œIf anyone is putting fake news out there, the ISPs have the obligation to in some way get that off the web.â€\\x9d â€œIn some wayâ€\\x9d are the key terms here, but to be fair, Blackburn also suggested that itâ€™s time for platforms such as Facebook to look into having human editors and we know how thatâ€™s been going recently. Yet hiring an editorial team to moderate content is in direct opposition to the hands-off algorithmic meta-business models of most online companies. Why? Because they primarily sell peopleâ€™s attention. Facebook has emphasised that it is not â€“ and never plans to become â€“ a media company. Is there a practical solution to fake news? I canâ€™t say. But I can see where we might be headed: the suppression of alternative voices and the censorship of content that addresses certain issues. In the 2016 infowars, if we arenâ€™t vigilant, the result of fake news is likely to be yet another layer of filtering. And this time around, the filters wonâ€™t be to segment audiences for advertising purposes or to target voting electorates; it wonâ€™t be to display the news articles, â€œlikesâ€\\x9d and intra-thread @replies that algorithms think we want to see first. The filters in the future wonâ€™t be programmed to ban pornographic content, or prevent user harassment and abuse. The next era of the infowars is likely to result in the most pervasive filter yet: itâ€™s likely to normalise the weeding out of viewpoints that are in conflict with established interests. This isnâ€™t a just problem limited to the centre, the left, or the right. Rather, this is a new reality. So, as everyone barricades themselves further into algorithmic information silos, encrypted messaging services, and invite-only social network sites, itâ€™s at least worth a thought. In the coming decade, Al-powered smart filters developed by technology companies will weigh the legitimacy of information before audiences ever get a chance to determine it for themselves.',\n",
              "  'Denial then panic: how the EU misjudged the British mood European leaders and officials have had a rocky ride leading up to the EU referendum in the UK. First, there was complacency and denial, then a sense of panic, and now a muddled attempt to prepare next steps, whatever the result of the vote. Six months ago, when David Cameron was trying to wrap up his renegotiation with the EU, the mood in European capitals was one of barely hidden annoyance â€“ the â€œBritish questionâ€\\x9d needed to be dealt with swiftly so that the EU could get back to addressing more serious and pressing challenges than the requests coming from London. Yet later, as opinion polls in Britain narrowed, the reaction shifted to a mixture of panic and bewilderment that Brexit might actually happen, bringing far-reaching consequences for the whole EU bloc. Now, days before the vote, minds have started to focus on what should be done to strengthen the European project, whichever way the referendum goes. But the answer to the question of â€œthe day afterâ€\\x9d remains blurry â€“ not least because of the shaky state of the Franco-German engine, which has always been key to the EUâ€™s solidity. For months, EU leaders kept mostly silent. They saw the prospect of a UK referendum as a tedious, unnecessary sideshow distracting attention from the more urgent and deeper matters the continent was confronted with â€“ the Greek euro crisis, dealing with Russia, terrorism, migration and asylum questions. European officials wanted the British question out of the way as fast as possible. The widely shared assumption was that Britons would be pragmatic enough to see pulling their country out of the EU was an utterly irrational and self-damaging move. Cameron had discreetly asked fellow EU leaders to refrain from wading into the referendum debate, for fear their input would be counterproductive. His hopes rested on the message Barack Obama would deliver while in London. But as time passed, it became obvious that hadnâ€™t done the trick. When concern grew, prominent European voices started openly sending warnings. At an event commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Verdun, the leaders of France and Germany criticised opponents of the EU. â€œThey denounce Europe as the source of evil, without realising that Europe was created out of the ravages of evil,â€\\x9d said FranÃ§ois Hollande. â€œIt is important for the survival of the European Union that we not retreat within ourselves but remain open to the other,â€\\x9d said Angela Merkel. Hitting an economic nerve, Germanyâ€™s finance minister made plain that if Britain quit the EU, it would deprive itself of access to the single market. Following the Swiss or Norwegian model â€œwonâ€™t workâ€\\x9d, said German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble: â€œIn is in, out is outâ€\\x9d. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, said that if it quit the bloc, â€œthe United Kingdom wonâ€™t be handled with kid glovesâ€\\x9d. EU leaders have in fact been struggling to find the right balance between two conflicting priorities: the need to demonstrate that Brexit could not be painless, to discourage other member states from contemplating a special status or from withdrawing from the bloc; and the need to limit the damage in case of a British departure by stating that cooperation would be preserved regardless. Perhaps nowhere in the EU is the geopolitical fallout of a possible Brexit being watched with more anxiety than in the Baltic states. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia, a country of 1.5 million where concern over Russian aggression has ridden high, said last month that over the past two decades heâ€™d never been less optimistic about Europeâ€™s prospects. He listed â€œthe rise of populism and serious talk of the UK leaving the EUâ€\\x9d among the most worrying developments. In eastern Europe, â€œcountries that had finished a 15-year odyssey to rejoin Europeâ€\\x9d suddenly felt that â€œthe world around us began to unravelâ€\\x9d, Ilves said. Britainâ€™s withdrawal would mark a weakening of Europeâ€™s liberal democratic order, many participants agreed. Some pointed to how Russian propagandists were trying to capitalise on European divisions, anticipating Brexit as a watershed. â€œThe sands of Europe are shifting under our feet,â€\\x9d said one speaker. Britain is the only country that ever committed to carrying out an in/out referendum, but surveys show there are many in favour of holding similar consultations in other countries (53% in France; 49% of Swedes). Last week, leaders of Europeâ€™s largest far-right and populist parties gathered near Vienna to urge Britons to leave the 28-nation bloc. The meeting, called the Patriotic Spring, was designed to strengthen cooperation among anti-immigration, Europhobic movements that have been on the rise across Europe and see Brexit as a decisive, galvanising factor. The leader of Franceâ€™s National Front, Marine Le Pen, told the crowd that â€œthe peoples of Europeâ€\\x9d should â€œtake back their libertiesâ€\\x9d just like â€œthe United Kingdom is regaining its libertyâ€\\x9d. Hosted by Austriaâ€™s Freedom party, which came close to winning presidential elections in May, the event was attended by representatives from nine countries, including from Germanyâ€™s Alternative for Germany party and Italyâ€™s Northern League party. For many on the continent, Britainâ€™s specific identity â€“ being â€œofâ€\\x9d Europe rather than fully â€œinâ€\\x9d it â€“ was never much in doubt, but there has been deep annoyance about how Cameron has put the very destiny of the EU at stake by falling into a political trap of his own making, ever since he called for a referendum in 2013. The irony, many European diplomats and experts say, is that if it were to leave the EU now, Britain would be shunning a club that has arguably never been as â€œBritishâ€\\x9d in its mindset. Events and crises have forced the EU to focus on trying to deliver concrete, pragmatic solutions to immediate problems rather than entertain abstract notions such as â€œever closer unionâ€\\x9d that the British dislike. Once emphatic talk of deepening political integration, for example, through initiatives meant to strengthen eurozone governance or to work on a common European defence and security policy, has become cautious. Thatâ€™s because France and Germany do not necessarily see eye to eye on how to proceed. Their leaders are faced with important elections next year and the rise of Eurosceptic movements in both countries is having a paralysing effect. Pro-EU statements will surely follow the British vote, whichever way it goes, but rapid and effective decision-making seems highly uncertain, say diplomats. One widely shared sentiment is that Brexit would represent a deep danger to Europeâ€™s democratic ideals because of possible domino effects and because of the overall popular loss of confidence in the EU it would signal. Karel Schwarzenberg, a former Czech foreign minister who was a close friend of VÃ¡clav Havel, once an important voice of Europeâ€™s moral conscience, takes the historical perspective: â€œWe in Europe have had the great opportunity over the last half-century to create a sense of common identity and interest â€“ why throw that away?â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Donald Trump links Mexico border wall plan to Israel's 'successful' separation barrier Donald Trump attempted to draw parallels between Israelâ€™s separation barrier and his much-touted border wall pledge on Sunday after both presidential nominees met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In Trumpâ€™s hour-long meeting with Netanyahu at his Trump Tower penthouse, the two reportedly discussed â€œat length Israelâ€™s successful experience with a security fence that helped secure its bordersâ€\\x9d, according to the Trump campaign. Israelâ€™s separation barrier runs for 440 miles (700km) partly along the 1949 armistice lines set after Israelâ€™s war for independence and partly through territory occupied by Israel after the 1967 war. It is a fence most of its length. In contrast, Trump has pledged to build a wall of concrete and rebar as high as 55 feet (17 metres) along the nearly 2,000 mile border between the US and Mexico. The meeting was the first of two that Netanyahu held with presidential candidates on Sunday, the day before the first presidential debate. Contrary to custom both meetings were closed to the media, the Trump campaign has prevented reporters from any access to his meeting with Netanyahu and aides to the Israeli prime minister reportedly went on to insist Clintonâ€™s campaign abide by the same rules Trump insisted upon. According to a readout provided by the Republicanâ€™s campaign, the nominee signaled support for the controversial moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as the real estate developer â€œacknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israelâ€\\x9d. Despite the fact Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism upon her marriage to property developer and top Trump campaign aide Jared Kushner in 2009, he has made some missteps so far in the campaign on Middle East policy and appealing to Jewish voters, who make up a key demographic in American elections. In 2015, speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump referred to stereotypes relating to Jews and money and told the audience: â€œYouâ€™re not going to support me because I donâ€™t want your moneyâ€\\x9d, suggesting they wanted to control politicians. In 2016, speaking before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel advocacy group, Trump gave a notably stilted performance in what was his first speech using a teleprompter. Clintonâ€™s meeting, which lasted just under an hour on Sunday night, was held at the W Hotel in Union Square. In the meeting, which was described by the Clinton campaign as an â€œin-depth conversationâ€\\x9d, Clinton â€œstressed that a strong and secure Israel is vital to the United States because we share overarching strategic interests and the common values of democracy, equality, tolerance, and pluralismâ€\\x9d. The Democratic nominee also reaffirmed her support for a two-state solution â€œthat guarantees Israelâ€™s future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignityâ€\\x9d. She stressed â€œher opposition to any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the UN security councilâ€\\x9d. After decades in public service, the former secretary of state has a far more extensive record on Israel and Middle East. She defended her pro-Israel bona fides in a March speech to AIPAC, saying: â€œI feel so strongly that America canâ€™t ever be neutral when it comes to Israelâ€™s security or survival.â€\\x9d In July 2015, she wrote a public letter condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. In the US, the BDS movement is a fringe issue pursued by left wing groups. It seeks to equate Israel with apartheid South Africa and has drawn significant concern in the American Jewish community. In the meeting, Clinton â€œstressed her commitment to countering attempts to delegitimize Israel, including through the BDS movementâ€\\x9d. However, unlike Trump, Clinton did support the controversial Iran nuclear deal that the US reached in 2015 as a part of an effort to prevent the Iranian regime obtaining nuclear weapons. Supporters of the deal have insisted that it provides the mechanisms to stop Iran building such armaments. Critics say it provides the regime, which is still listed as a state sponsor of terrorism, with an undeserved windfall in sanctions relief and does not contain enough nuclear safeguards. The US has long maintained a close alliance with Israel and the maintenance of that relationship has long been a crucial issue for many American voters. Despite a difficult personal relationship between the Obama White House and the Netanyahu government, including conflict over the Iran deal, the US pledged a record increase in military aid to Israel earlier in September. â€¢ This article was amended on 4 November 2016 to clarify references to Israelâ€™s separation barrier and to the BDS movement.\",\n",

The film reunites Crazy, Stupid, Love stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and is pitched as a tribute to Hollywoodâ€™s golden age of musicals but will have a contemporary setting. It will premiere in competition on 31 August. This yearâ€™s jury will be headed up by Sam Mendes. Gosling will play a jazz pianist who falls for Stoneâ€™s aspiring actor but the two face problems when they become more successful. JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for his role in Whiplash, and the singer John Legend also star. â€œLa La Land is a film that does not merely reinvent the musical genre, it gives it a brand new start,â€\\x9d said Alberto Barbera, Venice artistic director, in a statement. â€œIf Whiplash was the revelation of a new filmmaker, La La Land is his definitive, albeit precocious, consecration among the great directors of Hollywoodâ€™s new firmament.â€\\x9d Last yearâ€™s festival was opened by the survival drama Everest, which received middling reviews and box office, but previous years have seen Oscar winners Birdman and Gravity kick things off. The 31-year-old Chazelle made his name with the acclaimed drama Whiplash, which won three Oscars and was nominated for two more, including best picture. He also co-wrote the hit sci-fi thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane. Gosling was most recently seen in action comedy The Nice Guys and will next be seen in Terrence Malickâ€™s Weightless as well as Blade Runner 2.

              "  'Edward Albee obituary Edward Albee, who has died aged 88, has been described as both the first modern American playwright and the last great American playwright after Eugene Oâ€™Neill, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. In reality he was probably neither, although he was undoubtedly a substantial talent, who burst on to a stagnant American theatrical scene with The Zoo Story in 1959 and followed it up three years later with that major masterpiece of marital disharmony, Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Although Albee was to continue writing all his life, and had minor success with plays such as the Pinteresque A Delicate Balance (1966) and All Over (1971), it was not until 1991 that he had a late creative blooming and another theatrical hit with Three Tall Women. Like much of Albeeâ€™s best work, Three Tall Women was strongly autobiographical, drawing on his privileged but loveless childhood and memories of his mother, Frances, a domineering, Junoesque beauty who preferred horses to people, and almost anyone to her adopted son. He was born in Washington, to Louise Harvey, and immediately given up for adoption. Aged 18 days, he was handed into the care of Reed and Frances Albee, of Larchmont, New York. Reed was the wealthy, womanising son of the vaudeville theatre-owner and manager Edward Franklin Albee, and Frances (nee Cotter), better known as Frankie, was his third wife. It was rumoured that she had married Reed for his money. A childhood friend of Albeeâ€™s was subsequently to remark: â€œItâ€™s lucky he was adopted. He would not get much talent from those two.â€\\x9d A dreamy child with a penchant for drawing and music, the young Edward may not have wanted for material wealth, but grew up an observant outsider in his own home, ignored by his monosyllabic father and reviled by his mother. â€œMy mother and I disliked and mistrusted each other,â€\\x9d said Albee in an interview many years later, recalling that she would frequently tell him: â€œJust you wait until you are 18, and Iâ€™ll have you out of here so fast that itâ€™ll make your head spin.â€\\x9d In fact Albee was 20 before he left home, after an argument. Apart from a chance encounter, he never saw his father again, and he had no further contact with his mother for 20 years, although she was regularly to appear in different guises in his plays: as Mommy in The American Dream (1961), Martha in Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Agnes in A Delicate Balance and, most famously, as Three Tall Women, written shortly after her death in a creative act that Albee likened to an â€œexorcismâ€\\x9d. Mother and son may never have reached rapprochement, let alone anything approaching love, but Frankie was as much a muse for Albee as she was a monster. Albee spent the next 10 years living in and around Greenwich Village, bolstered by the $25 a week interest payments from a trust fund he had inherited from his grandmother, and occasional work as a telegram boy for Western Union. The ordinary people he met while tramping the city, their desperation and loneliness, became the inspiration for The Zoo Story. But he was also moving in artistic circles. By 1952 he was living with, and in the shadow of, the talented young composer William Flanagan. After the success of The Zoo Story, the myth grew up that it was Albeeâ€™s very first play, apart from a three-act sex farce written when he was 12 and destroyed by his mother. In reality, between 1949 and 1959, he served an intense apprenticeship, writing at least nine plays as well as short stories and poems. The Zoo Story, about two men sitting on a bench in Central Park, was started a month before his 30th birthday as, Albee was later to claim, a birthday present to himself. He was immediately aware that, for the first time, he had written something â€œworthwhileâ€\\x9d. New York theatre producers took longer to persuade, and The Zoo Story received its world premiere in a German translation at the Schiller theatre in Berlin on 28 September 1959. It was part of a double bill that included Samuel Beckettâ€™s Krappâ€™s Last Tape. It was not until January 1960 that the play had its US premiere, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village. As was to be the case with almost all of Albeeâ€™s subsequent work, the reviews were mixed, but the positive ones were enthusiastic enough to turn him from an unknown into a hot young playwright who was being mentioned in the same breath as Beckett and Ionesco. America had its first avant-garde playwright in the European mode. The playwright John Guare was to subsequently write of â€œthe debt that every American playwright writing after 1960 owes to Edward Albeeâ€\\x9d. The British playwright Tom Stoppard, whose early work was strongly absurdist, has said that it was seeing The Zoo Story that made him determined to become a playwright. But the Beckettian undertones of The Zoo Story, the Ionesco-influenced The American Dream, and A Delicate Balance, with its Pinter-like dialogue and sense of menace, left many wondering whether Albee was anything more than a clever imitator hitching a ride on the coattails of the latest theatrical fashion. The tendency to imitate was apparent even in his later work. Reviewing The Play About the Baby, which premiered at the Almeida in 1998, Michael Billington in the suggested that Albee was self-referring and cannibalising his own work. â€œThe play is more a treasure trove for Albee scholars and biographers than something of universal concern.â€\\x9d In his 20s, Albee had taken up again and then dropped his childhood hobby of drawing and painting. He was later to remark: â€œI realised I felt nothing beyond a certain curiosity, and I was making imitations that looked, to my eye, every bit as good as the originals.â€\\x9d This question of authenticity was always to raise itself in critical assessments of Albeeâ€™s plays. Although his defenders hailed him as a distinctive theatrical voice and great experimenter who refused to be pigeonholed, his detractors claimed that he remained derivative in form and content. Yet if there was any play that countered that latter view, it was Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? It also provided Albee with his only major commercial success, and gave the lie to the notion that he was incapable of writing a full-length play. The title came from a piece of graffiti that Albee had spotted in a Greenwich Village bar some years previously. Set on the campus of a small American college, it has middle-aged Martha, the daughter of the dean, who is married to George, the assistant professor of history, arriving back home after a party. In tow are the new young biology teacher, Nick, and his wife, Honey. What follows is a bilious and drunken few hours in which Martha and George indulge in game playing and fantasy, wounding both their guests and each other. Martha reveals a son that the pair have invented, a revelation that George tops by â€œkillingâ€\\x9d the imagined boy off. This imaginary or absent son was to become a recurring figure in Albeeâ€™s work. His friend Mel Gussow, the critic, said that, although Albee was to write many more plays, â€œVirginia Woolf was the cornerstone of his career: one play feeds all. In it, we can see strands reaching back to The Zoo Story (the act of confession, death as the final relief) and The American Dream (the household as microcosm) and forward to A Delicate Balance (the meaning of friendship and loyalty) and Three Tall Women (the price of parenting, the tricks of memory).â€\\x9d Although it was a commercial success and in 1966 made into a film directed by Mike Nichols and starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as George and Martha, Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? had by no means wholly ecstatic reviews. A lack of critical appreciation of his work was something that Albee learned to accept. â€œI have been both over-praised and under-praised. I assume by the time I finish writing â€“ and I plan to go on writing until Iâ€™m 90 or gaga â€“ it will equal itself out.â€\\x9d He almost managed it: Me, Myself and I, another play drawing on mother and son relationships, was produced in 2008, when he was 80. But at one point it seemed unlikely that Albee would be writing plays in his later years. After Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, his career went into serious decline and for the next 20 years his ability to write was affected by his love affair with alcohol, which had begun while he was still a child and would be asked to mix cocktails for his parents. Tiny Alice, premiered on Broadway in 1964 with John Gielgud and Irene Worth, was greeted with such incomprehension that Albee found himself forced to hold a press conference to explain its meaning. Even the author could not satisfactorily explain the bizarre story of a lay brother who is sent by a superior to the house of a wealthy woman and is enmeshed in a scenario of sexual hysteria, religious ecstasy and martyrdom. A Delicate Balance, described by Kenneth Tynan as â€œan exquisite fandango of despairâ€\\x9d, saw Albee return to the familiar territory of his adoptive parentsâ€™ life style. A beautiful play about â€œwhat happens when we turn our backs upon ourselvesâ€\\x9d, it was a success and won Albee the Pulitzer prize he had been unjustly denied for Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Although Albee continued to write plays and have them produced, most notably the death-watch drama All Over and his second Pulitzer-winner, Seascape (1975), a play in which two lizards intrude upon a marriage, his reputation was in free fall. Seascape ran for just two months. The disaster of The Man Who Had No Arms, about a man who sprouts a limb and achieves celebrity, only to see it wither as his arm atrophies, which closed on Broadway after just 16 performances in 1983, suggested that it was all over for Albee too. He did not need to write plays. Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? had made him a wealthy man, and he was renowned as a discerning collector of 20th-century art. For the next 10 years, the focus of his life shifted from writing plays to teaching and encouraging younger playwrights. He was a committed and generous teacher. After his fatherâ€™s death in 1961, Albee had resumed some contact with his mother, but the relationship remained difficult, not least because of Frankieâ€™s refusal to acknowledge her sonâ€™s homosexuality or his long-term partner, the painter and sculptor Jonathan Thomas, who did much to help Albee overcome his dependency on alcohol, and who predeceased him. Her death in 1989 spawned Three Tall Women, a poignant and entirely fictionalised armâ€™s-length look at Frankie as a 92-year-old, by now bed-ridden and incontinent, who is also glimpsed aged 52 and 26. In 1994 it was awarded a Pulitzer prize. There was another unexpected and late career gift in The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?, seen in New York in 2002 and at the Almeida in London and in the West End in 2004, about a successful architect in an apparently happy marriage who falls in love with a goat and has passionate sex with it. The London production boasted a brilliant central performance from Jonathan Pryce and an early stage appearance from a young Eddie Redmayne as his gay teenage son, in a savagely funny and dark examination of the limits of tolerance and the monsters that lurk beneath the exterior of modern middle-class everyday life. It was every bit as powerful and harrowing as Albeeâ€™s masterpiece. If his upbringing ensured that intimacy remained a problem for Albee all his life, with even some of his closest friends referring to him as â€œmysteriousâ€\\x9d or â€œunknowableâ€\\x9d, in his best work he was always present and always painfully revealing of his lost childhood and the barren, unhappy lives of his parents and their friends, and the best and worst that lurks in all of us. His strength as a playwright was that he continued to experiment with form and content all his life. A lazier, less passionate playwright might have contented himself with rewriting Whoâ€™s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in different ways, or just quit when the critical reception got rough. Albee may never have been able to summon the emotional openness to match Williamsâ€™s honesty, grotesque comedy and lyricism, nor the political commitment to match Millerâ€™s state-of-the-nation acuteness, but he was no also-ran. Rather he was one of the triumvirate who changed and shaped postwar American playwriting. The Zoo Story, A Delicate Balance and Whoâ€™s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? will never want for production; they dissect our desire to hide behind illusion with a devastating and unflinching accuracy. â€¢ Edward Albee, playwright, born 12 March 1928; died 16 September 2016',\n",
              "  'NBN Co executive likely to be called as witness after US utility disaster The executive appointed by Malcolm Turnbull to run NBN Co appears likely to be called as a witness in legal actions now under way in the US, flowing from one of the worst utility disasters in the countryâ€™s history. Legal actions have begun in San Francisco involving Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), a company Bill Morrow joined in 2006 as chief operating officer, before becoming chief executive a year later. Morrow left PG&E in September 2008. Morrow was appointed to run Australiaâ€™s largest infrastructure project, the NBN roll out, in December 2013, by the then communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull. NBN Co confirmed on Wednesday that Morrow expected to be called as a witness in the PG&E proceedings in the US, which are expected to last between six and eight weeks. According to US media reports, PG&E faces 13 criminal counts in the trial, including 12 charges the gas utility violated safety regulations and one charge of obstruction. The company has pleaded not guilty. PG&E is facing various legal actions relating to pipeline explosions in 2008 and 2010. The San Bruno explosion killed eight people and destroyed or damaged more than 100 homes. The two explosions occurred after Morrow left PG&E and NBN Co said on Wednesday he is not named in the current case being heard in San Francisco. His only involvement is as a witness. Various detailed investigations in the US have been critical of the companyâ€™s priorities, practices and decision-making over a period spanning more than a decade, including the two years when Morrow was in key executive positions at the utility. A California Public Utilities Commission report alleged that $100m was diverted by PG&E from safety and pipeline maintenance over 15 years. It suggested maintenance spending was under significant pressure in 2008 and in the two years immediately after Morrowâ€™s departure. â€œGas safety funding was heavily constrained in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 budget process,â€\\x9d says an audit undertaken by Overland Consulting for the CPUC. â€œIntegrity management and maintenance project budgets were viewed as discretionary funding that could be reduced to meet the overall budget targets set by executive management.â€\\x9d On Wednesday an NBN spokeswoman issued a short statement about the US legal proceedings. â€œMr Morrow is awaiting direction from the court and will appear as a witness in the US court case, if required,â€\\x9d she said. â€œBill has not been named as a party to the proceedings, he is attending only as a witness. As the matter is currently before the court, itâ€™s not appropriate for us to comment further.â€\\x9d The developments in the US once again thrust the NBN into the heat of the Australian election campaign. On Wednesday Fairfax Media revealed the NBNâ€™s chairman, Ziggy Switkowski, breached caretaker conventions by attacking whistleblowing in a published opinion piece. The revelation follows contentious police raids undertaken earlier in the campaign after a succession of leaks from the organisation placing questions marks over the pace and costs associated with the NBN roll out. Martin Parkinson, the head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, has confirmed that NBN management gave an advance draft of Switkowskiâ€™s opinion piece to the Department of Communications and the Arts, which in turn sought and received advice from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that the publication of the article would not be consistent with the established practices associated with the caretaker conventions. Parkinson says the view was â€œstrongly conveyedâ€\\x9d to the NBN management that the conventions applied to its chairman and its chief executive, and he knows that view was passed to Switkowski. But Switkowski wilfully ignored that advice by publishing the piece. â€œIn my judgment some of the comments in the opinion piece are not consistent with established practices around the caretaker conventions, which are directed at protecting the apolitical nature of government bodies and preventing controversies about the role of those bodies distracting attention from the substantive issues in the election campaign,â€\\x9d Parkinson wrote in a letter to Laborâ€™s finance spokesman, Tony Burke. â€œI have conveyed this view directly to Dr Switkowski.â€\\x9d Labor had complained to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that Switkowskiâ€™s opinion piece was a â€œclear breachâ€\\x9d of the caretaker conventions. They also complained that Switkowski had used his role as NBN chairman â€œto run a contestable script to the specific advantage of the prime minister and the Liberal partyâ€\\x9d. Campaigning in Perth on Wednesday, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, was critical of Switkowski. â€œAustraliaâ€™s internet speeds have seen a slip from 30th to 60th and we now have the NBN Co doing everything they can to cover up the facts,â€\\x9d the Labor leader said. â€œI think, for an otherwise respected businessman, Dr Switkowski, I think this is a shameful breach. Yet again NBN Co are doubling down on the cover-up, the denial.â€\\x9d On Wednesday afternoon, an NBN spokeswoman defended Switkowskiâ€™s decision to publish his opinion piece, saying it had to be done to protect the companyâ€™s reputation. â€œAny accusation that the companyâ€™s staff, management, its board and (by implication) its shareholder departments have conspired to keep large cost increases secret from the Australian people is not only plainly and demonstrably false, but is a serious accusation in light of the Corporations act,â€\\x9d the spokeswoman said. â€œThis is obviously not acceptable and the opinion piece addressed the allegations in a manner commensurate with the mode in which they were made; that is, publicly in the national media.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Commercial property prices could fall 20% after EU vote - analysts Fund managers are being warned by the City regulator not to embark on fire sales of office blocks and shopping centres to meet the demands of customers trying to cash in investments from property funds. Since the EU referendum on 23 June, more than half a dozen commercial property fundshave taken steps to adapt to the changing economic backdrop. Some have prevented customers withdrawing their cash by suspending trading; others have announced fund devaluations, including Aberdeen Asset Management, which devalued by by 17%. The Financial Conduct Authority reissued guidance to remind the investment industry of their duty to treat all customers fairly â€“ including those who want to remain in a fund. â€œIt is the duty of the fund manager to ensure that assets are valued fairly and accurately and to ensure that any subscriptions or redemptions of units take place at a fair price. Failure to do so may lead to some investors gaining at the expense of other investors in the same fund,â€\\x9d the FCA said. â€œIf a fund has to dispose of underlying assets in order to meet an unusually high volume of redemption requests, the manager must ensure these disposals are carried out in a way that does not disadvantage investors who remain in the fund or are newly investing in it,â€\\x9d the regulator added. Its new chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said earlier this week that the structure of these funds â€“ which offer instant redemption on assets that are difficult to sell â€“ might need to be reviewed. The commercial property sector has been a focus since the Brexit vote and there are predictions that some properties could fall by 20% in the wake of the UKâ€™s vote to leave the EU. Analysis by brokers at UBS found that some Brexit clauses were being triggered in commercial property transactions, causing some deals to fall through. UBS also expects the outlook to remain uncertain until negotiations over passporting rights â€“ which give firms in the City of London the ability to transact across the EUâ€“ are finalised. The UBS analysts said they expected London office values to fall by 20% â€“ an increase on their previous 15% estimate. Falls in the price of other commercial properties would not be so large. But, they said: â€œAt this early stage, there is limited evidence to point towards, to assess the potential magnitude of the impact on the commercial real estate market.â€\\x9d The analysts said: â€œWe have heard of some so-called Brexit clauses being triggered, causing deals to fall through. The long-term demand picture in London is uncertain as banks investigate the potential impact of a withdrawal of passporting rights, while the near-term outlook is also difficult. So the direction is certainly down, but the magnitude is uncertain.â€\\x9d The scale of the fall is not expected to reach the 44% decline that took place from 2007-09 when the financial crisis was at its peak. Since then, the market has changed, with banks making up less of the lending to the sector: the Bank of Englandâ€™s data shows bank exposure has fallen to Â£85bn from Â£150bn in 2011. Mike Prew, an equity analyst at Jefferies, has said up to Â£5bn of buildings could be sold to find the cash to repay investors in the funds, which some experts have warned could be closed until the end of the year. But Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the reduced prices might not result in actual sales of properties. â€œThe mark down in asset prices is really an educated guess, and it may not be borne out by real-world transactions, for better or worse, though with such sharp adjustments there appears to be a lot of bad news in the price.â€\\x9d UBS said that between 2008 and 2015, overseas buyers constituted two-thirds of office property transactions in the UK, so for them, the market is effectively already 10-13% cheaper because of the fall in sterling. This may encourage them to keep coming into the market although the caveat is that their rental return is also 10-13% lower. The UBS analysts said: â€œOf course, sterling weakness may be a short-term impediment to investment if investors expect the currency to weaken further.â€\\x9d They calculate that the shares of stock market-listed property companies are pricing in a 25-30% decline in property value.',\n",
              "  \"UK's big four banks face Â£19bn in compensation, fines and legal costs The UKâ€™s four biggest banks face paying out Â£19.5bn in fines, compensation and legal expenses this year and next, taking the total since 2011 to more than Â£75bn, according to the ratings agency Standard & Poorâ€™s. Over the five years to 2015, Barclays, HSBC and the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland have together incurred costs of Â£55.8bn to cover so-called conduct and litigation issues, after being penalised for rigging Libor and foreign exchange markets, and having to compensate customers for misselling payment protection insurance. â€œThis staggering amount represents around 9% of these banksâ€™ revenues during this period and about 90% of all conduct and litigation charges for the UK banking system,â€\\x9d S&P said. The total cost for the UK banking industry was Â£62.5bn. While the ratings agency is now predicting charges of Â£19.5bn by the end of 2017, it also describes this year as the â€œlast year for mega chargesâ€\\x9d. This is, in part, because of an expectation that the cost of the PPI scandal, which has reached Â£34bn, will ease off. â€œWe maintain our view that 2016 will likely be the last year for mega conduct and litigation charges. That said, we also believe that conduct and litigation matters have become a â€˜way of lifeâ€™ for UK banks,â€\\x9d S&P said. â€œWe do not believe that future retail conduct redress, including relatively new issues such as packaged bank accounts, will come close to the scale of PPI,â€\\x9d it added. S&P published its report as the big four banks prepare to publish their first-quarter results, which will be scoured for signs of any further PPI provisions.\",\n",
              "  \"Surgery in the womb: miracle maker for NHS's tiniest patients Prof Kypros Nicolaides studies the overhead monitor. â€œThe head of the baby is down, and it is much easier to do when the head is up. So, there are two things we can do.â€\\x9d He pauses and an expectant silence falls. â€œWe can all concentrate and chant. Do you want to chant? Like Hare Krishna?â€\\x9d Tension in the room immediately dissipates, replaced with slightly bewildered, muted laughter. â€œOr,â€\\x9d he continues, â€œI will press the baby to bring the head up.â€\\x9d He firmly kneads the pregnant belly, slowly encouraging the foetus until: â€œBingo. OK.â€\\x9d This is room one in the Harris Birthright research centre at Kingâ€™s College hospital, London, where patients are among the tiniest and most vulnerable of all treated by the NHS. Traumatised parents find themselves here after the hammer blow that their unborn child, or children, may not survive pregnancy or birth. In the dedicated hands of Nicolaides, 62, known simply as â€œProfâ€\\x9d and an internationally renowned foetal medicine consultant, they are offered hope. No absolute guarantees, but good odds, his skill and a little of his trademark banter. Crucially, though, they benefit from his many years of pioneering research and experience, which reassures them they are giving their babies every chance in the world. Nicolaides has been called a miracle maker, and a genius at the forefront of in utero surgery within the NHS for about 40 years. In dimly lit room one, with its huge bright screens and a control panel straight from the USS Enterprise, science, technology and experience coalesce as he prepares to perform the operation. He is working to counter the potentially fatal abnormality congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), with a procedure currently undergoing randomised trials. CDH is rare. About one in 4,000 unborn babies will develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. A third of those cases could benefit from the FETO (fetoscopic tracheal occlusion) surgery Nicolaides has played a leading role in developing. The daughter of Luissa Galloso, 31, from Windsor, is one such case, and in the next 30 minutes Nicolaides will achieve something unimaginable a decade ago. He will insert a miniature latex balloon through the wall of the uterus down through the mouth of Gallosoâ€™s baby daughter and position it delicately in the windpipe then inflate it. There the balloon will stay, wedged tight like a little cork. Normally inserted at about 26-28 weeks, it will be removed at around 35 weeks. It will trap fluid in the babyâ€™s lungs that would normally escape through the mouth, so forcing the lungs to expand and develop. Nicolaides estimates that in the most severe cases of CDH, it can increase survival rates from 15-20% to about 50%. An interactive guide to the procedure â€œSee, that is the spine, the heart is on that side â€¦ and next to it, this black thing, that is the stomach. It should not be there, it should be further down. Thatâ€™s the issue,â€\\x9d he tells Galloso, who is on her back, looking at her baby on the overhead monitor as her fiance, Stuart, and her mother, Jill, sit alongside, their eyes glued to the grainy ultrasound images. First he must put the baby to sleep. It is crucial she remains completely still. A long needle is inserted into the womb and he guides it towards the babyâ€™s shoulder then administers the anaesthetic. Once the baby is asleep, local anaesthetic is applied to Gallosoâ€™s side and a thin tube is inserted. Through this Nicolaides feeds the fetoscope, a miniature telescope measuring just 2mm in diameter, and a 3D image of the sleeping baby suddenly bursts out from the screen. Precision is everything. Nicolaides expertly guides the fetoscope towards the babyâ€™s mouth and an incredible visual journey begins. â€œThat is the nostril. That is the upper lip there. That is the mouth, see the gums,â€\\x9d he says as the fetoscope continues over the babyâ€™s tongue, past the uvula and tiny vocal cords and epiglottis. â€œNow we are going down the windpipe,â€\\x9d he says. â€œAnd there. That is where we will put the balloon.â€\\x9d A long, narrow flexible catheter is introduced, at the end of which is the tiny, deflated balloon, which is smoothly guided to its placement site. All eyes are fixed on the monitor as water is dripped into the balloon until it expands to about 2cm long and 5mm wide. Once it is securely in place, the fetoscope makes its reverse journey up through the mouth, and out. The whole procedure is minimally invasive to the mother, who experiences only a small skin incision of about 3mm. â€œThe biggest problem with this procedure,â€\\x9d muses Nicolaides, as eyes nervously flick towards him, â€œis my wet trousersâ€\\x9d he adds, pointing to leaked fluid from the procedure that has dripped on to him. â€œNow, when I go back outside, what do you think people will think, at my age?â€\\x9d And once more, the tension dissipates. â€œThatâ€™s it. All over.â€\\x9d If successful, such surgery can mean babies with severe CDH can be safely delivered, though they may have to undergo surgery after birth to correct the hernia and reposition internal organs. Research is everything, according to Nicolaides. â€œUnless you have research, you cannot progress.â€\\x9d Based at Kingâ€™s College hospital three days every week, Nicolaides also has a private practice, the Fetal Medicine Centre, with profits ploughed into his Fetal Medicine Foundation charity, which supports research and training to identify abnormalities as early as possible and develop minimally invasive procedures to correct them. Among such procedures is fetoscopic laser treatment, used to coagulate blood vessels shared by identical twins who have the rare and potentially fatal twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which occurs in 50 out of 100,000 pregnancies. In TTTS, the blood goes from one twin to the other, but one baby receives more blood than it gives up. Crook and victim, he calls them, but both are at risk. Since his first experiments with the procedure, in 1992, he estimates he has performed it more than 2,000 times. He uses a fetoscope with a fibre-tipped laser inside the uterus, again inserted through a tube, to identify the shared blood vessels and cut them so the babies are on their own. Claire Burgonâ€™s twin boys are 17 weeks, but the discrepancy between their size is 39%. Speed is of the essence. She and her husband, David, who are from Gillingham, Kent, were referred from their local hospital only the previous day, and are now in room one. â€œMy doctor said you were the best in the world,â€\\x9d she tells Nicolaides. â€œI pay him, I pay him,â€\\x9d he responds. He examines the ultrasound screen. â€œSo, this is the crook that is stealing blood, and that is the victim on the other side,â€\\x9d he points out. One has hardly any fluid around it, the other too much. â€œSo we have to put a telescope inside the uterus between the two and find the blood vessels that join the two circulations and just try to separate them.â€\\x9d He traces the blood vessels with the endoscope. â€œSee them branch out there. And see that white line. That is the sac of the big baby. That white line is the collapsed membrane. See how the blood vessels are crossing over from this side and going over. So, that is where we will be cutting. â€œYou will hear some buzzing noises, but you wonâ€™t feel anything,â€\\x9d he reassures Burgon. Like all of Nicolaidesâ€™s patients, Burgon, 30, and her husband have been on a rollercoaster journey to this point, and this procedure is not without risk. â€œIâ€™ve had the wobbles. But it is the best thing to do,â€\\x9d Burgon says after the operation. â€œIf we didnâ€™t, the risk of losing both was a lot higher. So, I have just got to run with it now.â€\\x9d Her husband adds: â€œIt is a case of just sit there and hope, really. Look and hope.â€\\x9d Nicolaides, born in Paphos, the son of a Cypriot doctor, was a medical student at Kingâ€™s. In his last year of studies, medical students had to choose an â€œelectiveâ€\\x9d for three months. â€œMost used this to go on a big holiday to the Bahamas, or the Seychelles, or Hawaii to â€˜observeâ€™ medicine there. I was scared of flying,â€\\x9d he said. So he stayed at Kingâ€™s, just as a pioneer of obstetric and gynaecological ultrasound, Prof Stuart Campbell, arrived. Nicolaides was â€œoverwhelmedâ€\\x9d by the concept of seeing a foetus before birth, and within a few years was one of the worldâ€™s leaders in foetal medicine. Today, his office walls are adorned with photographs of smiling babies, including many twins and triplets. His successes. â€œThey all send me pictures. I have thousands,â€\\x9d he says. But with success comes the weight of expectation. â€œIt puts a lot of pressure on us in terms of the knowledge that many babies would still die. Sometimes when they do die you feel, obviously, extremely bad. You become very personally attached to the patients. â€œOther times, you try to work out whether you have done something wrong or if there is something you have to change to improve the technique. And, yes, other times you become the target of their anger, because if you are seen as being the miracle maker, when things donâ€™t work out you are not viewed as a normal doctor that has tried. You can become the opposite of the miracle maker. You can become the devil.â€\\x9d Forty years on, he has no regrets about his chosen path. â€œIt has been a very exciting journey to be at the forefront of a lot, a lot of developments, the creation of this new field â€¦ A lot of anxieties when we were developing new techniques. I think it is mainly rewarding. There are moments of distress, there are moments when you are excited. There are moments of depression when things donâ€™t go right. But overall, it has been a fantastic trip. â€œThere is no better reward in life than a woman coming along to show you her baby,â€\\x9d he says, â€œand sending photographs to say: â€˜Thank you, this baby would not have been born.â€™ How can you judge that? Against what? That is the ultimate reward.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'The lies Trump told this week: from murder rates to climate change Military and law enforcement personnel â€œIâ€™m proud of the fact that Iâ€™ve always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.â€\\x9d â€“ 11 October, interview with Fox News Trump has not always treated members of the military and law enforcement with respect. Last year he insulted John McCain, who endured torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam; this summer he derided the Muslim parents of a soldier who died in the Iraq war; he has called top generals â€œembarrassing to our countryâ€\\x9d and said they have been â€œreduced to rubbleâ€\\x9d; and he has repeatedly impugned the ethics of federal investigators and even public safety officers such as fire marshals. Crime â€œYou look at the crime and you wonder why. And by the way, do you know, it was just announced that murder is the highest itâ€™s been in our country in 45 years?â€\\x9d â€“ 11 October, Panama City, Florida â€œWe have the highest murder rate in this country in 45 years. More people are being murdered now than being murdered in 45 years.â€\\x9d â€“ 12 October, Lakeland, Florida Trump has distorted an FBI statistic to make a false claim: in September the agency reported that murders and non-negligent manslaughter rose in the US by 10.8% in 2015, the largest single-year increase since 1971. That is not the same as saying there are more murders in the US than at any point since 1971: 15,696 murders were reported in 2015, down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24,703 and 24,526. There were more murders in 1971 (17,780) than in 2015. The murder rate declined 42% from 1993 to 2014, even though the population increased by a quarter. During this weekâ€™s debate Trump almost cited the statistic accurately, saying: â€œWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.â€\\x9d But the FBI figure is a national one, not restricted to cities. Climate change â€œClimate change. Now I want, and just so you know, do you know that Iâ€™ve won numerous environmental awards? Iâ€™m a believer in the environment. Itâ€™s gotta be within reason. Iâ€™m a believer.â€\\x9d â€“ 12 October, Ocala, Florida Trump has claimed off and on to be an environmentalist since at least 2008, when he was battling with officials in Scotland to build a golf course and resort on land that had been home to a variety of wildlife. He has maintained for years that the US should drill for oil wherever possible â€“ an opinion that falls well out of line with even the moderate environmentalism of Hillary Clinton, who has taken oil and gas exploration on a case-by-case basis. He has claimed to have received environmental awards since 2011, though the only award that could be found seems to be a 2007 prize given to the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey by the Metropolitan Golf Association Foundation. That award was received by the grounds director, Greg Nicoli, for preserving 45 acres of bird habitat on the property. A few years later, Trump cut down a small forest in Virginia for the sake of another golf course, and in May of 2011 New Jerseyâ€™s department of environmental protection fined him for repeated violations. He has also called for dismantling basic Environmental Protection Agency programs and rules. Trump has repeatedly said he does not believe in climate change, which is more pertinent to the environment than a New Jersey golf course. In 2014 he called it a â€œhoaxâ€\\x9d, and in 2012 he claimed it was invented by China to trick Americans into caring about environmental regulations. The Earth is warming at an â€œunprecedented rateâ€\\x9d, Nasa reported in August, sea ice is disappearing, and more than 97% of climate scientists agree that the climate is warming dangerously. Researchers are already drawing links between such climate change and disasters such as Louisianaâ€™s deadly flooding in September. Endorsements â€œAnd by the way, ICE just gave us their endorsement, first time ever, and the border patrol, all the agents, 16,500 agents just gave us their support.â€\\x9d â€“ 12 October, Lakeland, Florida Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a government agency. It does not endorse political candidates. A union representing about 7,600 ICE officials endorsed Trump in September. A group representing 16,500 of 21,000 border patrol agents similarly endorsed Trump. This does not represent all the agents.',\n",

According to Variety, the film, which opened to Oscar buzz and enthused reviews at this yearâ€™s Sundance film festival, has been bought for a reported $17.5m, the biggest purchase the festival has ever seen. Actor Nate Parker, best known for roles in Non-Stop and Beyond the Lights, took on the story as a passion project. As well as writing and directing, he plays the lead role of Nat Turner, who led a slave uprising in 1831 that led to 60 white deaths and stricter laws on how slaves could be controlled. Parker invested his own money in the production, which also stars Armie Hammer, Gabrielle Union and Jackie Earle Haley. The bidding war was reportedly between Fox Searchlight, Sony, The Weinstein Company and Netflix. Fox Searchlight picked up the worldwide rights with hopes of pushing it for next yearâ€™s Oscar race. It would make for an interesting inclusion, given the debate over the 2016 Oscars and the filmâ€™s largely African-American cast. â€œItâ€™s cultivation,â€\\x9d said Parker at the festival. â€œI think diversity is more than a colour palette. Itâ€™s a celebration of heritage and culture and thatâ€™s the one thing that we donâ€™t do so often. Before that we have to heal. There are wounds that exist because of the legacy of slavery in this country.â€\\x9d Other big purchases of the festival include Kenneth Lonerganâ€™s Manchester-by-the-Sea, starring Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck, and Whit Stillmanâ€™s Love & Friendship, both picked up by Amazon.',\n",
              "  'How Donald Trump emboldens bigots across the world If there were a United Nations of the global far right, Donald Trump would be its undisputed leader. His message does not just resonate in the forlorn rust-belt towns of rural America: it travels far beyond the countryâ€™s shores. It is bigotry without borders. Consider the incredible prayer session organized for him in New Delhi by a nationalist Hindu group last week. Amid prayer bells, incense and chanting, good wishes fluttered from the Indian capital all the way to the US. A poster made for the occasion declared Trump to be the â€œhope for humanityâ€\\x9d. Despite his unwavering â€œAmerica Firstâ€\\x9d nationalism, Trumpâ€™s message has struck a chord with the Hindu right because they share a common enemy. Long at odds with religious minorities in the country, it is no surprise that some Hindu nationalists approve of Trumpâ€™s plan to ban Muslim immigration to the United States. â€œHeâ€™s the only man who can put an end to Islamic terrorismâ€\\x9d, said Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta. â€œHe is the savior of mankind.â€\\x9d They are not the only ones to hold Trump in high esteem. The far-right Greek Golden Dawn party support him. The founder of Franceâ€™s Front National, Jean-Marie Le Pen, said he would vote for him. The Dutch leader of the Party of Freedom and anti-Islam campaigner, Geert Wilders, now tweets things like â€œMake The Netherlands Great Again!â€\\x9d. Meanwhile the head of Italyâ€™s anti-immigrant Northern League party, Matteo Salvini, says he considers Trump â€œheroicâ€\\x9d and added â€œwe are on the same wavelength when it comes to many thingsâ€\\x9d. Before Trump arrived on the scene, Vladimir Putin was the uncrowned leader of the illilberal factions of the western world. A motley crew of European fringe parties leaps to legitimize him at every turn. When Putin annexed Crimea, representatives from 12 European parties flocked there to act as observers during the referendum â€“ giving it the veneer of legitimacy. Now, it appears Putin has competition from across the Atlantic. The populistsâ€™ admiration for Trump should not be a surprise: he has been doing their bidding on issues that matter to them most. Trump backs Brexit â€“ he said the UK would be â€œbetter off withoutâ€\\x9d the EU â€“ and criticized Angela Merkel for making â€œa tragic mistake with the migrantsâ€\\x9d. That mistake, of course, was to let them into Europe in the first place. But itâ€™s not just the far right that is watching him closely. Even mainstream conservative politicians are looking to the Trump phenomenon for cues â€“ if not always successfully. In the race to be Londonâ€™s mayor, Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative party parliamentarian, ran what his Muslim opponent, Sadiq Khan, and liberal commentators called a campaign â€œstraight out of Donald Trumpâ€™s playbookâ€\\x9d. The strategy backfired miserably, but it is telling that Trumpâ€™s tactics found an echo in Goldsmithâ€™s campaign in the first place. Trump emboldens those who sow seeds of division and hate. He has brought the vile, the vulgar and the downright venomous into polite company. One white nationalist in the United States recently noted that his members used to feel demoralized â€“ presumably because their views made them pariahs. Not any more. They walk with newfound confidence now. There is a multiplier effect at work in Trumpâ€™s victories. As the far right make common cause with each other â€“ fighting each othersâ€™ battles, echoing each others slogans â€“ no advance in one corner of the globe is without its consequences in another. Remember Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian terrorist and white supremacist who killed 77 people in 2011? In his hate-filled, rambling manifesto he wrote about an unlikely ally in the fight against Islam: the Hindu far-right. â€œIt is essential that the European and Indian resistance movements learn from each other and cooperate as much as possible. Our goals are more or less identical.â€\\x9d Breivik was on to something: many of the goals of the far right are identical. The group praying for Trump in New Delhi understands that well. That is why, in the fight against Trump in the United States, liberals and progressives should join forces with those battling their own bigots overseas. It will take a global effort to overcome a threat that has implications for us all â€“ no matter where we live.',\n",
              "  'Your bra could kill you â€“ and other breast cancer myths busted A diagnosis of breast cancer can be frightening, and many of the known risk factors â€“ genetics, ageing, being a woman â€“ are beyond our control. That is why myths are attractive. They sell us the idea that there is something simple we can do to protect ourselves from cancer. We look at three of the most common myths. Your bra could be killing you The idea that wearing an underwired bra can cause breast cancer has been around since 1995, when Sydney Singer and Soma Grismaijer published their book Dressed to Kill, which claimed there was a link. The idea was revived last year when a practitioner of alternative medicine wrote an essay on Gwyneth Paltrowâ€™s website, Goop. What these people have in common is that none of them is a cancer researcher or medical doctor. Singer and Grismaijerâ€™s â€œstudyâ€\\x9d was not reviewed by medical experts and published in a respected journal, as is the norm for bona fide scientific discoveries. According to a version of their story now doing the rounds on Twitter, they interviewed more than 4,000 American women and discovered that women who donâ€™t wear bras have a â€œ1 in 168 chanceâ€\\x9d of developing breast cancer, as opposed to a â€œ3 in 4 chance for those who wear a bra 24 hours a dayâ€\\x9d. Their explanation is that underwired bras block circulation of lymphatic fluid, causing breasts to swell with â€œtoxinsâ€\\x9d (a word more associated with pseudoscience, in my experience, than genuine medical knowledge). It is unlikely, though, that that lymph fluid would be trapped by an underwire, because it doesnâ€™t flow in that direction, and a properly fitting bra prevents breast ligaments from overstretching. Scientists have also criticised Dressed to Kill for not taking into account known risk factors for breast cancer, most notably obesity, which increases the likelihood a woman will wear a bra for longer periods. A comprehensive 2014 study by the globally respected Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre in Seattle found that no aspect of bra-wearing was associated with breast cancer risk, and Breast Cancer Now, Cancer Research UK, the American Cancer Society, and the US National Institutes of Health are just a few of the organisations that have stressed the lack of evidence that wearing bras increases cancer risk. American obstetrician and gynae-cologist Dr Jennifer Gunter has described this myth as â€œcruelâ€\\x9d, saying that it scares women and could cause women with a breast cancer diagnosis to blame themselves for wearing a bra. If you find your bra is painful, you should not panic that you have cancer, but you should head to the high street and get measured for a new bra. Sweat-free armpits or healthy breasts? You have to choose The idea that antiperspirants cause breast cancer is usually justified either by the idea that preventing underarm stickiness blocks â€œtoxinsâ€\\x9d from being sweated out, or that the aluminium salts used to block the sweat glands are absorbed through the skin and trigger cancer. The source appears to be an email hoax which spread so quickly that cancer charity helplines were overwhelmed by anxious callers worried they had been doomed by their personal hygiene routines. The vast majority of harmful substances in our bodies are flushed out by the liver and kidneys (which is why we drink lots of water when we are hungover), not sweated out through our armpits. Almost all the studies purporting to show that antiperspirants cause cancer are from a single laboratory, with Dr Philippa Darbre often the only named author. One of the studies that, at first glance, shows aluminium is present in breast tissue is, on a second look, inconclusive because the authors didnâ€™t compare normal (non-cancerous) tissue. Unless there is significantly more of something in a tumour compared with normal tissue, it isnâ€™t wise to speculate that it has a role in cancer. A 2002 study published by the Journal of the National Cancer Institute studied 1,606 women and discovered there was no link between the use of antiperspirants and cancer. Another study, in 2006, compared women with and without breast cancer and found that 82% of women who were cancer-free had used antiperspirant whereas only 52% of the women with breast cancer had, which certainly doesnâ€™t support the theory that antiperspirants increase cancer risk. Mammograms emit cancer-causing radiation, or squeeze tumours so the cancer spreads Finding breast cancer early reduces your risk of dying from it by up to 25% â€“ which makes the myth that mammograms cause cancer, or make it spread, a particularly dangerous one. The consensus in the medical community is that the benefits of mammograms far outweigh any risk. An annual, 20-minute mammogram involves a tiny dose of radiation, less than a chest X-ray and nowhere near enough to increase the risk of developing a cancer. The process of metastasis, in which cells break off a tumour, spread, and settle in a different place in the body to create a secondary tumour, is biologically complex and canâ€™t be caused by squeezing a tumour. Mammograms are frightening because of the potential that they will find a cancer â€“ but the mantra that early detection saves lives is true and one of the reasons that what used to be a death sentence is now survived by eight out of every 10 women diagnosed with breast cancer. If you are worried about cancer, you can find reliable information from NHS Choices, or the websites and helpline of registered cancer charities such as Cancer Research UK, the Irish Cancer Society or Macmillan Cancer Support. As always, speak to your GP if you have any concerns about your health. â€¢ Naomi Elster is a writer and scientist researching for a PhD in cancer medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland, supported by the Irish Cancer Society',\n",
              "  'How your vote could count â€“ in every country in the world Imagine if you could vote in other countriesâ€™ elections. Or, to be precise, to vote on other countriesâ€™ elections: of course we donâ€™t have the power directly to elect anyone or remove them from office â€“ but power comes in many forms these days, and the influence of an international electorate could be surprisingly strong. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m offering people the chance to do just that. Every month or so, I will be picking an election somewhere in the world, or occasionally a referendum: weâ€™re choosing mainly presidential elections for the time being because theyâ€™re simple to explain. Then we feature that election on our website, Global Vote, with a snapshot of each candidate giving very succinct information about who they are and what they appear to stand for. Each candidate is also invited to answer two standard questions: 1. If you are elected, what will you do for the rest of us, around the world? 2. What is your vision for your countryâ€™s role in the world? In the absence of answers to these two questions, we will do our best to summarise the candidateâ€™s views on these topics, as faithfully and neutrally as we can, from their published statements and interviews. We encourage our voters strongly to find out as much as they can about each candidate, and we provide links to start this process. Then our participants vote on their chosen candidate, and we release the results, usually the day before the electorate goes to the polls. For each election, thereâ€™s a magic tipping-point where global voters actually outnumber the electorate: every time we reach this point, the world has â€“ in my opinion â€“ officially changed a little, and we are one step closer to acknowledging our essential interdependence. Why am I doing this? Because we live in an infinitely connected world, and the choices made by the leaders of all countries, large and small, near and far, rich and poor, affect all of us sooner or later. Their energy policies affect our shared climate; their defence policies affect our collective peace; their trade policies affect our prosperity and employment prospects; their stance on migration either helps or hinders the collective effort to manage the crises of human movement that continually sweep across the world. And because we are all affected by those policies, we must all make our views known about what sort of leaders we prefer our neighbors to choose. Our voters are encouraged never to make their selection on the grounds that one or another candidate will do a better or worse job of running that particular country â€“ thatâ€™s the concern of the electorate alone â€“ but on the grounds that he or she will remember the rest of humanity and the planet when running their country. Today, I believe, all leaders have a dual mandate. They are primarily responsible, as they always have been, for their own people and their own slice of territory: but in our hyper-connected world, they are also responsible, to some degree, for every living thing in the world, and for every square mile of the planetâ€™s surface and the atmosphere above it. And those two mandates are by no means mutually exclusive: incorporating the international dimension can make better domestic policy, not just unhappy compromises. Itâ€™s very tempting, in an age of constant crisis and terrifying global challenges, to retreat into selfishness, tribalism, fear and hostility towards the rest of our own species. And of course, in times like these, we are never short of politicians who win support by echoing that fear and hostility: but since our problems are global and our challenges are shared, theyâ€™re moving in the wrong direction. We need leaders with minds that telescope, not minds that microscope: a lot more collaboration and cooperation between countries, and a little less competition, is the only way forward. This global vote aims to ensure that this critical attribute is never forgotten when we choose our leaders. Rightwing or leftwing, conservative or progressive, the politics are secondary to the main question: are you with humanity or against it?',\n",
              "  'Give children a stake in society to improve their mental health Pressure on mental health services for young people is increasing (â€œCare for children with mental health problems is woeful, say GPsâ€\\x9d, News, last week). But it is no good calling for more money for services without attending to the causes. Widespread social insecurity is bad for health â€“ mental and physical. The canary in the mine is the phenomenal explosion of despair among teenage girls, who are turning up to hospital emergency departments, self-harming and suicidal. As community child and adolescent mental health clinics turn patients away, more of them are admitted in crisis to general hospital wards, with patchy mental health expertise to call on. Norman Lamb MP was a coalition government mental health minister when these trends began, so it is rather weak of him now to complain that â€œrationing of care in such a vital area of care is scandalousâ€\\x9d. While most political pressure will be on community funding, what is urgently required is specially skilled mental health and social service professionals in hospital paediatric departments. Though tax havens, state terrorism, migration, global warming and inequality may be far from their minds, these young people are warning us of the danger we all face: the vicious cycle in which people across the social spectrum become less interested in the public good that they are expected to pay for in taxes, because they can see nothing good in it for them. The poison in the social atmosphere that is hitting teenagers is their unprecedented lack of prospects in education, employment and housing. Dr Sebastian Kraemer NHS consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, 1980-2015 London SW2 A quick swipe can stop touts Secondary sale of tickets for big events has been set up to facilitate the tout industry (â€œHow ticket touts are bleeding fans dryâ€\\x9d, Special Report, last week). It makes no difference to performers, as they get the same cut from the original ticket price whether or not touts are involved. If performers care about fans they should insist that ticketing for any gigs mirror the simple and transparent system for buying cinema tickets online. Payment is taken from the credit card, then the ticket is collected when your credit card is swiped at the venue. There is no possibility of ticket transfer unless you trust a friend to use your credit card. Buyer beware.

My Mexican wife and I have survived 40 such years. The upside is that, like travel, cross-cultural marriage broadens the mind, and the children, ideally bilingual, learn to function across cultures as cosmopolitan world citizens. Joseph Palley Richmond, Surrey High value of online petitions Catherineâ€™s Bennettâ€™s criticism of online petitions as clickbait is unjust (â€œPeople power can be toxic: sign here if you agreeâ€\\x9d, Comment, last week). Organisations such as 38 Degrees have achieved some remarkable results by informing, encouraging and mobilising vast numbers of people who would otherwise succumb to apathy in the face of toxic corporate and rightwing self-interest. It is a sad fact of modern-day life that only a small minority of people take an active and regular part in campaigns that promote a fair and compassionate society. Online petitions make ordinary people feel as if they have a voice, so itâ€™s at least one step better than indolence. I donâ€™t like the tone or purpose of the petition to sack Laura Kuenssberg, but unfortunately there are always going to be some, like â€œJoeâ€\\x9d, who use (misuse?) petitions in this way and the websites cannot easily prevent them without losing their valuable impartiality. I would have gladly signed a petition to sack the odious Jeremy Clarkson and felt justified in doing so. Would that campaign have been â€œunfair and uglyâ€\\x9d? Michael Pollard Wareham, Dorset BAâ€™s i360 boon to Brighton The letter â€œCouncil spending on towersâ€\\x9d (8 May), contains misleading information. First, the public funding referred to comes from the Public Works Loan Board, which funds projects that generate a commercial return. It is not local taxpayersâ€™ money, nor was it a case of the council choosing to fund British Airways i360 instead of paying for local services. The statement that this arrangement will cost residents Â£1.4m a year is false; in fact, quite the opposite is true. Brighton and Hove city council will earn about Â£1m a year from brokering the loan, which will be reinvested back into the city at a time of public cuts. In addition, 1% of British Airways i360â€™s ticket sales will be paid to the council in perpetuity, even after the loan has been repaid. We also estimate that the attraction will bring Â£25m per year in economic benefit to the city; it will support local businesses and generate hundreds of new jobs that pay the living wage. David Marks Chairman, Brighton i360 Age does not dictate politics I will be 72 by the date of the EU referendum and am getting tired of reading articles that seem to portray everyone of my age as a reactionary isolationist (â€œâ€˜Our grandparents should not be deciding our futureâ€™â€\\x9d, News, last week). I am not. I firmly believe that the days when Britain achieved dominance by exploiting half the world and fighting the other half have long gone and our only hope for the future is through cooperation with out nearest neighbours. And I couldnâ€™t support a cause backed by Duncan Smith, Gove, Farage and Johnson. If you want to make your voices heard, get off your apathetic arses and do something about it.

              "  'Dancing to the Coen brothersâ€™ tune: Channing Tatum on his role in Hail, Caesar! Seemingly force-fed into sailorsâ€™ whites, Channing Tatumâ€™s first appearance in a Coen brothers film has already triggered dropped jaws across the world. Tip-tapping his way across the screen, Tatum makes good use of his dance skills as the star of an On-the-Town-ish film-within-a-film, one of several that punctuate Hail, Caesar!, which is set mostly within the confines of a single Hollywood studio in the early 1950s. The homoerotic subtext is never far from the surface of Tatumâ€™s scenes, and Hail, Caesar! gets lots of yuks out of it. â€œPeople now canâ€™t believe it,â€\\x9d says Tatum. â€œThe 50s were very square and conservative, but audiences loved these guys. The dancing is so elegant and dainty, but guys on the street would love it without irony. Itâ€™s such a fascinating juxtaposition that 50s men could like Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. All that â€œIâ€™m gonna dance with you, palâ€\\x9d type stuff.â€\\x9d Casting Tatum was bit of a masterstroke on the Coensâ€™ part, in keeping with their tradition of big-name cameos. But Tatum is something of a conundrum: he may look like a jock, but his willingness to hoof it up on film â€“ from Step Up to Magic Mike â€“ has been instrumental to his success. â€œThereâ€™s not a lot of actors that dance, I guess,â€\\x9d he says, â€œthough I have never actually danced like this. When we started, the Coens werenâ€™t sure if they wanted it to be tap dancing, but they did know they wanted it to be Gene Kelly-esque and athletic. Originally, it was going to be on a battleship, with me running up the sides, me on a big huge gun. But then it started to change to a tap dancing and singing thing. That I was really panicked about, but it worked out OK.â€\\x9d Tatum is a highly rated actor these days, thanks to an astute association with a string of auteurish American directors alongside his more obviously commercial romcoms and action movies. He has made three films with Steven Soderbergh (Magic Mike, Haywire, Side Effects), Foxcatcher for Bennett Miller, Jupiter Ascending with the Wachowskis and, most recently, The Hateful Eight with Quentin Tarantino. â€œIâ€™ve been really blessed to work with so many different types of director. Itâ€™s fascinating. The way the Coens work is really precise, and they really try to bring you into the process. We get pages every morning, and on the back is the entire storyboard for the scene. But, within that, you can try anything, they donâ€™t lead you that way. With Quentin, heâ€™ll give you a note that is so specific: I want you to pick this up on the first syllable, I want you to walk all the way across the room, set it down, then say the last syllable. Itâ€™s just different styles. Everyone has their way.â€\\x9d â€¢ Hail, Caesar! is released in the UK on 4 March.',\n",
              "  \"Cannes 2016: festival chief defends return of 'usual suspects' Cannes film festival head Thierry FrÃ©maux has dismissed suggestions that one of the industryâ€™s most famous events routinely presents work from the â€œusual suspectâ€\\x9d directors to the detriment of new talent. Interviewed by the Hollywood Reporter, FrÃ©maux said the presence of Cannes favourites such as Jim Jarmusch, Pedro Almodovar, Ken Loach, Andrea Arnold, Nicolas Winding Refn and Olivier Assayas in competition for this yearâ€™s Palme Dâ€™Or was in no way indicative of a closed-shop attitude. â€œEvery film we pick up is because of the film and what the film means in terms of schedule, programming and selection,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWhat about the names people ignore? What about the Brazilian film-maker [Kleber MendonÃ§a Filho], the German director [Maren Ade]. No one asks me about the new names.â€\\x9d FrÃ©maux said it was unfair to criticise organisers for inviting back Sean Penn, whose film The Last Face made the competition slate a decade and a half after his 2001 film The Pledge debuted on the Croisette. â€œItâ€™s only the second time, and the last time was 15 years ago,â€\\x9d he said. â€œSo there are not that many â€˜usual suspectsâ€™, and we of course make efforts to put new names in the selection.â€\\x9d The artistic director said Jarmusch had two entries in the festivalâ€™s official 2016 selection: bus-driver drama Paterson and Iggy Pop documentary Gimme Danger, to show his diversity as a film-maker. â€œLike a writer, he can do both a novel and sometimes reportage in the press,â€\\x9d said FrÃ©maux of Jarmusch. â€œItâ€™s the same expression and is part of the territory of creation. Itâ€™s good to have documentaries, because sometimes things can only be expressed by reality. I think we have to open windows. We have to show what a film-maker can be.â€\\x9d Cannes has been criticised in the past for a perceived bias against female directors. In 2012, there were none at all in the main competition for the Palme dâ€™Or. The festival chief said one-fifth of this yearâ€™s films were directed by women, which he said was â€œthree times the proportion of what it is in the industryâ€\\x9d. â€œTo have more women in Cannes, we have to have more women in cinema. Cannes is not the problem, do not blame Cannes. Cannes is the consequence,â€\\x9d he said.\",\n",
              "  'Call for new powers to protect company pensions after takeovers The Pension Regulator should be given new powers to block company deals so that employees and pensioners are better protected in the wake of events such as the collapse of BHS, the former chair of the Pension Protection Fund has said. Lady Judge, who stepped down last month, said the regulator was not equipped to deal with situations such as that at BHS, sold by Sir Philip Green to Dominic Chappell for Â£1 last year and now left with an estimated Â£571m pensions black hole. â€œThe regulator should have the right to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction that might disadvantage pensioners,â€\\x9d the Financial Times quoted Judge as saying. â€œIf it had had the power, we would not be in this situation.â€\\x9d However, the pensions minister, Ros Altmann, suggested such an approach would be too strong. â€œI would be nervous about saying a transaction could not take place. But we must be clearer [to companies] about the consequences of failure to get clearance for a deal. â€œIf we need to give the regulator more powers we will, but it is not clear yet. Any changes would need to be done with careful consideration and not kneejerk reaction.â€\\x9d Lady Altmann said the regulator needed to be given the chance to carry out its report on the BHS pension scheme. But Judge said pensioners needed more protection. â€œWe need to take care of [pensioners] as a country and not let unscrupulous big corporates put them in a position where they wonâ€™t be able to have a reasonable future,â€\\x9d she said. In a separate interview, Altmann said Britainâ€™s vote to leave the European Union would place greater strain on companies with defined benefit pension schemes, driving deficits higher if the economy weakens and interest rates stay lower for longer. She said that under such circumstances, businesses should not be forced into putting too much money into schemes. â€œI do think itâ€™s important that when weâ€™re making plans for the future the government recognises that employers are having, in some cases, a really difficult time supporting the pension promises they have made. â€œPart of the reason for that is the trend in interest rates. What we donâ€™t want to do is offset some of the stimulus by forcing companies to put too much money into their pensions in the near term if they canâ€™t afford it, so thereâ€™s that delicate balancing act.â€\\x9d Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has signalled that Threadneedle Street is ready to pump more money into the economy following the shock Brexit vote. Immediately after the result was announced Carney said the Bank was prepared to provide UK banks with an additional Â£250bn of liquidity. The governor has also hinted that interest rates could be cut from their record low of 0.5%. Another option available to the Bank would be more quantitative easing, where new money is created to buy assets such as government bonds.

              "  \"Starship Troopers reboot on the way as Hollywood's 90s nostalgia train rolls on Starship Troopers is being rebooted with hopes that it will launch a new franchise. The 1997 original, directed by Paul Verhoeven, was an adaptation of Robert A Heinleinâ€™s novel which, according to the Hollywood Reporter, will act as the more direct source of the new version. The script will come from Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, who have also written the upcoming Baywatch movie. Itâ€™ll be produced by Neal H Moritz, whose credits include Sweet Home Alabama and Battle Los Angeles. Verhoevenâ€™s film, which starred Casper van Dien and Denise Richards, received critical acclaim for its surprising satire but was a disappointment at the box office, making just $121m worldwide from a $105m budget. It spawned three sequels, without the directorâ€™s involvement which didnâ€™t receive a theatrical release. Verhoevenâ€™s other sci-fi hits Robocop and Total Recall have also been remade, receiving disastrous reviews. â€œSomehow they seem to think that the lightness of say Total Recall and Robocop is a hindrance,â€\\x9d Verhoeven said about the remakes in an interview. â€œSo they take these somewhat absurd stories and make them much too serious â€¦ Both those movies needed the distance of satire or comedy to situate it for audiences.

              "  'Spotlight review â€“ Catholic church called to account over child abuse Spotlight is a movie of clarity and force: the true story of the Boston Globeâ€™s â€œSpotlightâ€\\x9d team and its 2002 campaign to investigate a church cover-up of child abuse by Catholic priests. Its value was obvious at the Venice film festival last year, but it has grown in my mind since: what seemed like a plodding pace is actually a shrewd approximation of the steady drumbeat that effective reporting creates. This is what the police work of investigative journalism looks like: the documents, the phone calls, the pre-web clippings, the expense of shoe leather in going out to interview people who donâ€™t want to be interviewed. Spotlight doesnâ€™t have the sensational thrills of Alan J Pakulaâ€™s All the Presidentâ€™s Men (1976), or for that matter David Fincherâ€™s Zodiac (2007). And there are a few journo cliches. But it has the sinew of a really good procedural, underpinned by genuine moral outrage. Michael Keaton plays veteran reporter Walter â€œRobbyâ€\\x9d Robinson, working alongside hot-tempered Mike Rezendes, played by Mark Ruffalo, and Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams, who has an extraordinary scene when she persuades an abuser-priest to come to the door and talk. Boston was a clubbable world in which a smile on the golf course, or a pat on the back and a meaningful look at the church social was enough to enforce silence. It takes a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) â€“ non-Boston, non-Catholic â€“ to shake things up and insist on doing the child abuse story properly, and paradoxically reveal the paperâ€™s own former shortcomings. The film has real insights to offer: the cast powerfully convey the journalistsâ€™ horror at realising the abuse stretches back decades or even centuries and also how abuse is as much about power as sex and that homosexuality is beside the point: the abusers have evolved the choice of boy victims because boys are reticent, more likely to swallow their shame and not speak out. A powerful story.',\n",
              "  'Kung Fu Panda 3 chops Allegiant down to size at UK box office The winner: Kung Fu Panda 3 While the February half-term holiday this year saw Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks Animation all sit out the contest â€“ ceding the field to Foxâ€™s Chipmunks franchise â€“ itâ€™s a different story this Easter. Good Friday sees the arrival of Disney Animationâ€™s Zootropolis, and itâ€™s already begun popping up in previews, with more to follow. Itâ€™s been preceded by DreamWorks Animationâ€™s Kung Fu Panda 3, which cruised to an easy win at the box office with Â£3.18m from 583 cinemas, plus Â£1.59m in previews, for a total of Â£4.77m. The weekend number is very similar to previous entries in the franchise, although more aggressive previews on the earlier films pushed those totals higher. Kung Fu Panda debuted in July 2008, with Â£3.11m plus Â£2.96m for a Â£6.07m total. Kung Fu Panda 2 began in June 2011, with Â£3.07m plus Â£3.12m in previews for a Â£6.19m total. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the whole Easter school holiday ahead of it â€“ two solid weeks when families will be available for cinema visits, although it will face fierce competition from Zootropolis. The runner-up: Allegiant Landing a place below Kung Fu Panda 3, and with about half the box office, is Allegiant, the latest in The Divergent Series. This third entry in the franchise has begun with Â£1.58m, plus Â£262,000 in Thursday previews, for a four-day total of Â£1.84m. Stakeholders may have concerns that the franchise is now moving in the wrong direction, since the original Divergent kicked off in April 2014 with Â£1.77m, and Insurgent just under a year later with Â£2.55m plus previews of Â£385,000, for a Â£2.94m total. Ignoring previews, Allegiant has opened 38% below its predecessor. If previews are included in the calculations, itâ€™s a very similar story: Allegiant is 37% behind Insurgent. The budget of Allegiant has not been confirmed, but the first film is believed to have cost $85m, and the second $110m. These films have a significant physical cost, and are a lot more expensive than rival franchise Maze Runner, for example. Both Maze Runner films outgrossed both in the Divergent series so far, going by worldwide box office. The wisdom of splitting the final novel in Veronica Rothâ€™s YA trilogy into two films â€“ Allegiant and next yearâ€™s Ascendant â€“ may be called into question. If audience interest continues to flag, this hardly looks like the easy commercial win that resulted from the extending of the Harry Potter, Twilight and Hunger Games film franchises. The real runner-up: London Has Fallen Although Allegiant occupies second position in the official comScore chart, it does so only by virtue of the filmâ€™s Thursday previews. Going by Friday-to-Sunday takings only, the runner-up honours belong to London Has Fallen, which grossed Â£1.80m, taking its 11-day tally to Â£6.44m. The Gerard Butler actioner fell just 34% from the previous frame â€“ the gentlest decline of any film in the top 10. Thatâ€™s remarkable for several reasons. First, London Has Fallen is a sequel, so you would expect business to be front-loaded, with fans rushing out in the first week. Second, itâ€™s a mainstream action picture, which is a genre that tends to skew to the kind of audiences (including young males) that are traditionally quick to see films, swiftly moving on to fresh releases. Third, reviews have been largely hostile, often an indication that word-of-mouth will be weak once the film begins to engage beyond the core fanbase. The filmâ€™s IMDb user rating remains a decent 6.4/10, and the MetaCritic score is 28/100 â€“ evidently the audience and the paid professionals continue to disagree on the filmâ€™s merits. London Has Fallen has already overtaken the lifetime total here of predecessor Olympus Has Fallen (Â£6.22m). The film may be benefiting from a local boost in the UK, but the numbers suggest that further cities may soon be welcoming a dishevelled Butler trotting around familiar landmarks with US president Aaron Eckhart, while dispatching evil terrorists. The scary movie face-off: The Witch v The Ones Below Finding the perfect release date is never easy, but observers did wonder whether it was wise for distributor Icon to position its London-set chiller The Ones Below on the same weekend as Universalâ€™s supernatural horror The Witch. The films are very different, but they both classify as â€œelevated genreâ€\\x9d, having premiered respectively at the Toronto and Sundance film festivals. Wouldnâ€™t the audiences overlap? In the end, the potential clash was solved by the very modest programming of The Ones Below â€“ David Farrâ€™s film was released into just 11 cinemas, all in London. Whether that was a strategic choice made by the distributor, or one forced on it by the indifference of cinema programmers, is hard to say. The Ones Below enjoys a 71% Fresh critical rating at Rotten Tomatoes, but a weak 38% approval rating among the siteâ€™s users. UK opening gross is a poor Â£7,000. The Witch debuts with Â£448,000 from 179 cinemas, including modest previews of Â£11,000. Site average is a decent Â£2,501. Given the low production cost, this looks like a canny acquisition for Universal, which has multiple foreign rights. The indie challenger: Anomalisa While Hail, Caesar! continues to be the top attraction for fans of independent cinema, Charlie Kaufmanâ€™s stop-frame animation Anomalisa is now positioned as a plucky alternative. Curzon Artificial Eye pushed the film out into 80 cinemas, delivering a debut of Â£223,000, including previews of Â£30,000. Assessing that result is a distinct challenge, since there are no real directly comparable titles you can point to. The Kaufman-directed Synecdoche, New York began in May 2009 with Â£123,000 from 30 venues, including previews of Â£10,000 â€“ but that was live action, with a rich ensemble cast including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener and Michelle Williams. Reviews were significantly more ecstatic this time around, but a stop-frame animation about a male midlife crisis, with David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh in the voice cast, was never exactly a commercial slam-dunk. The future Thanks to the arrival of Kung Fu Panda 3, takings are a nice 26% up on the previous frame, and a very healthy 94% up on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when the top new releases were Run All Night and Suite Francaise. (This outcome is essentially a blip, caused by an earlier Easter, and hence the earlier release this year of a big animated film.) Among official releases, cinema bookers will have big hopes pinned on the JJ Abrams-produced 10 Cloverfield Lane, a â€œspiritual successorâ€\\x9d to gene hit Cloverfield. Alternatives include fellow genre offering The Boy; religious-themed historical actioner Risen; and Ben Wheatleyâ€™s starry JG Ballard adaptation High-Rise.

This perception is to some extent shared by the medical community, which canâ€™t quite make its mind up whether depression is a physical â€œillnessâ€\\x9d, rooted in neurochemistry, or a negative habit of thought that can be addressed by talking or behavioural therapies. Iâ€™m not concerned about which of these two models is the more accurate. Iâ€™m still not sure myself. My primary task here is to try to explain something that remains so little understood as an experience â€“ despite the endless books and articles on the subject. Because if the outsider cannot really conceptualise serious depression, the 97.5% who do not suffer from it will be unable to really sympathise, address it or take it seriously. From the outside it may look like malingering, bad temper and ugly behaviour â€“ and who can empathise with such unattractive traits? Depression is actually much more complex, nuanced and dark than unhappiness â€“ more like an implosion of self. In a serious state of depression, you become a sort of half-living ghost. To give an idea of how distressing this is, I can only say that the trauma of losing my mother when I was 31 â€“ to suicide, sadly â€“ was considerably less than what I had endured during the years prior to her death, when I was suffering from depression myself (I had recovered by the time of her death). So how is this misleadingly named curse different from recognisable grief? For a start, it can produce symptoms similar to Alzheimerâ€™s â€“ forgetfulness, confusion and disorientation. Making even the smallest decisions can be agonising. It can affect not just the mind but also the body â€“ I start to stumble when I walk, or become unable to walk in a straight line. I am more clumsy and accident-prone. In depression you become, in your head, two-dimensional â€“ like a drawing rather than a living, breathing creature. You cannot conjure your actual personality, which you can remember only vaguely, in a theoretical sense. You live in, or close to, a state of perpetual fear, although you are not sure what it is you are afraid of. The writer William Styron called it a â€œbrainstormâ€\\x9d, which is much more accurate than â€œunhappinessâ€\\x9d. There is a heavy, leaden feeling in your chest, rather as when someone you love dearly has died; but no one has â€“ except, perhaps, you. You feel acutely alone. It is commonly described as being like viewing the world through a sheet of plate glass; it would be more accurate to say a sheet of thick, semi-opaque ice. Thus your personality â€“ the normal, accustomed â€œyouâ€\\x9d â€“ has changed. But crucially, although near-apocalyptic from the inside, this transformation is barely perceptible to the observer â€“ except for, perhaps, a certain withdrawnness, or increased anger and irritability. Viewed from the outside â€“ the wall of skin and the windows of eyes â€“ everything remains familiar. Inside, there is a dark storm. Sometimes you may have the overwhelming desire to stand in the street and scream at the top of your voice, for no particular reason (the writer Andrew Solomon described it as â€œlike wanting to vomit but not having a mouthâ€\\x9d). Other negative emotions â€“ self-pity, guilt, apathy, pessimism, narcissism â€“ make it a deeply unattractive illness to be around, one that requires unusual levels of understanding and tolerance from family and friends. For all its horrors, it is not naturally evocative of sympathy. Apart from being mistaken for someone who might be a miserable, loveless killjoy, one also has to face the fact that one might be a bit, well, crazy â€“ one of the people who canâ€™t be trusted to be reliable parents, partners, or even employees. So to the list of predictable torments, shame can be added. There is a paradox here. You want the illness acknowledged but you also want to deny it, because it has a bad reputation. When I am well, which is most of the time, I am (I think) jocular, empathetic, curious, well-adjusted, open and friendly. Many very personable entertainers and â€œcreativesâ€\\x9d likewise suffer depression, although in fact the only group of artists who actually suffer it disproportionately are â€“ you guessed it â€“ writers. There are positive things about depression, I suppose. It has helped give me a career (without suffering depression I would never have examined my life closely enough to become a writer). And above all, depression, in nearly all cases, sooner or later lifts, and you become â€œnormalâ€\\x9d again. Not that anyone but you will necessarily notice. But on the whole itâ€™s a horror, and itâ€™s real, and it deserves sympathy and help. However, in the world we live in, that remains easier to say than do. We donâ€™t understand depression partly because itâ€™s hard to imagine â€“ but also, perhaps, because we donâ€™t want to understand it. I have a suspicion that society, in its heart of hearts, despises depressives because it knows they have a point: the recognition that life is finite and sad and frightening â€“ as well as those more sanctioned outlooks, joyful and exciting and complex and satisfying. There is a secret feeling most people enjoy that everything, at a fundamental level, is basically OK. Depressives suffer the withdrawal of that feeling, and it is frightening not only to experience but to witness. Admittedly, severely depressed people can connect only tenuously with reality, but repeated studies have shown that mild to moderate depressives have a more realistic take on life than most â€œnormalâ€\\x9d people, a phenomenon known as â€œdepressive realismâ€\\x9d. As Neel Burton, author of The Meaning of Madness, put it, this is â€œthe healthy suspicion that modern life has no meaning and that modern society is absurd and alienatingâ€\\x9d. In a goal-driven, work-oriented culture, this is deeply threatening. This viewpoint can have a paralysing grip on depressives, sometimes to a psychotic extent â€“ but perhaps it haunts everyone. And therefore the bulk of the unafflicted population may never really understand depression. Not only because they (understandably) lack the imagination, and (unforgivably) fail to trust in the experience of the sufferer â€“ but because, when push comes to shove, they donâ€™t want to understand. Itâ€™s just too â€¦ well, depressing. â€¢ In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

              "  \"How Silicon Valley's parents keep their children safe online Even in Silicon Valley, parents struggle to navigate the online risks and opportunities for their children. The internet might be the first place to turn for homework and entertainment, but how much should parents intervene to protect their children from adult content, cyberbullying and being contacted by dangerous strangers? Thirteen-year-old Nicole Lovell was murdered by two students who authorities say met her on the messaging app Kik. One in 25 young people aged 10-17 have received aggressive sexual solicitations online, researchers found. And 34% of students aged 11-15 say they have experienced cyberbullying. So how should parents handle this digital minefield? We asked the Silicon Valley experts. â€˜Trying to control access is massively complexâ€™ Jon Gillespie-Brown is a British entrepreneur and author who has been in Silicon Valley for nine years. He lives in Portola Valley, California, with his wife and two sons aged 13 and 15 My kids have access to pretty well everything. Both my wife and I work in technology â€“ she in gaming, I in software â€“ and weâ€™ve got every gadget going. The kids have got smartphones, laptops, iPads and game boxes, and every one of them is connected to the internet. Trying to control all that access across a mishmash of platforms and devices is massively complex. I am a programmer. I know how to program every single one of these things but the tools weâ€™ve used to try and restrict access to certain types of sites â€“ such as porn sites â€“ are ineffective and block content needed for them to do their homework. Now our method for control is training. Both our kids have been curious and looked at pornography. We try to teach them about the internet just like youâ€™ve got to teach them about sex, drugs and rockâ€™nâ€™roll. Our older son uses Ask.fm, Snapchat and Instagram a lot, and there was lots of inappropriate texting and commenting in his early use of social media. However, heâ€™s also really into sports and wants to go to college, so heâ€™s starting to control his use as he knows that the schools [universities] are going through social media and using it as a means to exclude people. So heâ€™s gone through every account and deleted all the bad language and inappropriate content. Because there were some cyberbullying cases at school â€“ and lawsuits when parents found out â€“ a lot of the chat has moved to Snapchat, which is like the magically disappearing piece of paper I used to pass round when I was a kid. The Bay Area is a very aggressive environment for children and their parents, and there have been a lot of teen suicides. Parents are all working very long hours in stressful jobs and donâ€™t have as much time to be with their kids.We have drilled into them what is appropriate and what is legal, and that if they get caught sending stuff online itâ€™s a legal document and will be used against them in a way that whispering something mean canâ€™t be. â€˜We told our son to use Snapchat, not Twitterâ€™ David DeMember founded digital agency Toi, where he builds apps and websites with his wife, Betty. They live with their three boys, aged five, 14 and 17, in Millbrae, California We try to treat our children as adults. I donâ€™t believe in spying on your kids unless you have to. Itâ€™s crazy that parents think they should have their passwords and use tracking tools. Before these things existed were you bugging your kids? Itâ€™s absurd that this is the norm these days. The main concerns when it comes to the web are: overusage, pornography, the fact that you donâ€™t know who you are talking to online and cybersecurity. I am mostly concerned about usage and security. There was a weekend when our middle son played nine hours of video games â€“ World of Warcraft and Gears of Warâ€“ so we are now monitoring his usage. We also ask them not to take their phones into their bedrooms at night because it affects their quality of sleep. If you binge on anything too much â€“ TV, computer, phone, candy, fatty food, salt, whatever â€“ itâ€™s bad for your body and mind. If you are constantly playing games eight or nine hours every day it will erode your interests in other things. With porn, we know they are going to watch it â€“ itâ€™s natural to be curious. So we talk to them about how certain kinds are better than others. If we tell them not to watch it, it may push them into the darker corners. You canâ€™t shelter your kids from the world. The internet is accessible everywhere and they know how to use private browsing. There was a time when our eldest son and his friends started to use Twitter and would post anything â€“ some of it borderline. A fellow player on the football team posted about spilling bong water in the car and lots of kids were using the N-word. So we talked about that. We reminded him that everything you post online is there forever and if he wants to have those conversations he should use Snapchat (which might sound crazy). Weâ€™re fairly liberal people, both politically and in our parenting style, so you would think our kids would be crazy. But I believe that by creating a more inclusive conversation weâ€™ve demystified some of this stuff. â€˜We know her passwordsâ€™ Tiffany Shlain is a film-maker and founder of the Webby Awards and the Moxie Institute Film Studio. She lives with her husband, UC Berkeley robotics professor and artist Ken Goldberg, and their two children, aged 13 and 10, in Marin County, California Our 13-year-old daughter has a phone that just texts and calls â€“ not a smartphone. Many of her friends have smartphones and are on them the whole time. She has a laptop and uses Twitter for social media, which of course we follow and we find the whole experience quite interesting. She also loves to write and watch short videos on YouTube. We know her passwords and she isnâ€™t allowed to take her laptop into her room â€“ it is only used in spaces we all are, so it canâ€™t be this private world she dives into. If Iâ€™m ever worried about a particular website I will check with Commonsense Media to see what age rating they give it. We are in our seventh year of doing something we call â€œTechnology Shabbatsâ€\\x9d, where we all turn off screens Friday night to Saturday night. That has been amazing for our family and all of us in so many ways. This is the one day we all appreciate being present with each other in a way that I think is waning in our world â€“ with no screens to pull us away from what weâ€™re doing. We read, play board games, do art projects, bike rides, and just hang out. And then each week she (and everyone in the family) re-appreciates technology all over again by the end of the day on Saturday. â€˜Neither of my kids are on Facebookâ€™ Sanjay Dholakia is the chief marketing officer of Marketo, which makes marketing automation software. He lives in Bend, Oregon, with his wife and two kids, a 13-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son My daughter has a school-issued iPad which is relatively heavily locked down by the school district. She also has a smartphone. We encourage her not to use WhatsApp and Snapchat at this point as we donâ€™t think itâ€™s age appropriate, although she does text her friends regularly. We want to teach her to self-select the groups that sheâ€™s part of. My six-year-old has a Wi-Fi-enabled smartphone that no longer has cell connectivity which he uses to email his family. They both play games such as Minecraft and my daughter uses an app called Lark to write art-inspired poetry. Neither of my kids are on Facebook, or any places where they could be exposed to a lot of people â€“ they are too young. Itâ€™s just not appropriate. However weâ€™re just entering a zone where some of my daughterâ€™s friends are getting Facebook accounts and we probably wonâ€™t let her have one for a little bit longer, until she gets to high school. Iâ€™m on the board of directors at a high school and cyberbullying is a big problem for older children, particularly on these big social networks. You canâ€™t watch over your children or be with them 100% of the time, so we need to teach them how to make good decisions and know when things might be dangerous. My kids are growing up digitally native and the learning curve is so steep that our main job is to teach them good decision-making. I donâ€™t want my children to see the online worlds as a scary place they need protection from â€“ there are positives and negatives. â€˜The prevalence of in-app payments is really troublingâ€™ Bret Taylor is the former chief technology officer of Facebook, credited with inventing the â€œlikeâ€\\x9d button. He left in 2012 to set up his own company Quip, which makes a hybrid communication, collaboration and productivity service. He lives with his wife and kids, aged six and four, in Lafayette, California My wife and I both come from the technology industry and we want to make sure our kids donâ€™t have too much screen time. We have experimented with giving our kids access to Netflix, but we noticed they were finding things that were a bit more mature than we were comfortable with. So we got rid of all of the internet-connected apps such as YouTube and Netflix, and now only download shows weâ€™ve pre-approved. One issue weâ€™ve consistently encountered is the prevalence of in-app payments, where weâ€™ve found the kids have bought things without really knowing what they were doing â€“ I find it really troubling. These are games designed for kids aged six or seven. They are not paying for it, nor do they have the capacity to work out if itâ€™s worthwhile. The ironic thing is that most people in the tech industry restrict their kidsâ€™ technology usage, while our friends outside of the tech industry are much more liberal and all their kids use smartphones. No matter how good the technology is, itâ€™s a parenting problem as much as a tech problem. Your kid will run into content thatâ€™s too mature and it creates the need for difficult conversations. The internet is messy and filled with a lot of different stuff so you need to have those conversations early â€“ at eight, nine or 10, rather than when they are 12, 13, 14. â€˜They can only use their tablets in a child-friendly modeâ€™ Aaron Bromberg is the senior manager of product management for Amazon Devices. He lives in Palo Alto, California, and has two kids, aged seven and five We donâ€™t let our kids use the internet without our supervision, but there hasnâ€™t been a strong pull from either of them. They both have the Kindle Fire Kids Edition tablet which they use in FreeTime mode (this restricts access to the web browser and disables in-app purchases, social features and location-based services). They use the TV and Fire Stick to get online to watch streaming video. Weâ€™ll also use YouTube or show them things on the internet together as a family with our supervision. We often just spend a bit of time after dinner watching clips â€“ most recently we watched a load of break-dancing videos. Looking ahead for when they are older, Amazon has just released a kid-friendly web browser within the FreeTime service. This lets them have access to a limited set of sites that Amazon has reviewed. The main thing we try to impress upon them is that when they share things with their friends or family, they know who they are communicating with. When they share things online they donâ€™t know who they are communicating with. Everyone is listening to the online conversation. We review friends lists and some communications Brendon Lynch is chief privacy officer at Microsoft. He lives with his wife and two children, aged nine and 13, and in the Bay Area Weâ€™ve had first-hand experience with cyberbullying, unfortunately, but luckily we were able to get it quickly addressed. The learning for us was understanding just how important it is for kids to look out for each other and to involve an adult if they are at all concerned. I feel that stranger danger is reasonably well managed with a combination of restrictions, monitoring and education. Our kids have all Microsoft devices, of course. The 13-year-old has a phone and they both use either a tablet or laptop and are both Xbox fans, although the nine-year-old cannot accept Xbox friends or download apps without a parent approving it â€“ and they canâ€™t play multiplayer online games. The 13-year-old has fewer restrictions but can only participate in multiplayer online games with audio off (to protect from inappropriate language) and canâ€™t access content with age-inappropriate ratings. We use family safety tools to report on websites visited. We also review friend lists and some communications, in a transparent way. My main advice is to be actively engaged and interested in their lives, which includes life online. â€˜We donâ€™t let our kids use social mediaâ€™ Richard Freed is a child and adolescent psychologist who lives in Walnut Creek with his wife and two daughters, aged eight and 12. He is author of the book Wired Child, looking at the negative impact of technology on children Our kids use computers at school and our older daughter has a phone without a data plan, but we restrict their use at home. Weâ€™ve really worked hard to have our kids not on social media and that is driven by my research and clinical practice. Itâ€™s remarkably clear to me that kidsâ€™ use of social media pulls them away from the two most important things in life: family and school. We have this belief in our country that kids hit their teens or preteens and they should be engaging with peers and technology. Thatâ€™s a modern fabrication. Kids have always needed family first, and kids who spend more than two hours on a social network a day have high levels of psychological distress. My main concern with social media and gaming is that they are increasingly developed by psychologists and user researchers who focus on making sure that the product is not put down. Itâ€™s nearly impossible to use just a little bit. Moderation sounds good, but I donâ€™t think it applies. For me itâ€™s the same as giving kids a little bit of alcohol. Iâ€™ve seen that blow up in the faces of families that have truly lost their kids. I also see an increasing number of kids in my practice getting hooked on pornography â€“ boys and girls, starting at about 11. The filters just donâ€™t work; they are not effective. I recognize that our family has much stronger limits than most. My kids have, as a result, gravitated towards other kids who donâ€™t spend a bunch of time with screens. They are friends with people who are more involved in school, family and sports.\",\n",
              "  'Shaking, crying, panic â€“ the trauma of a benefits assessment with PTSD Looking through the letter marked â€œAtos healthcareâ€\\x9d, Lucia â€“ who has severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety â€“ can only remember fragments of the assessment for personal independence payments (PIP) she had two months ago. A normal day is often hard enough for the 34-year-old. Luciaâ€™s husband Daniel, a former hospital administrator, had to leave work three years ago to become her full-time carer. Sheâ€™s been relying on disability living allowance (DLA) â€“ the benefit the government is replacing with PIP â€“ for six years to pay for weekly therapy sessions. On the days running up to her Atos medical, Lucia tells me she â€œwasnâ€™t functioningâ€\\x9d because of the stress: she couldnâ€™t get dressed, wash, or leave the house. But within a few minutes of the assessment itself, she began to panic: she could hear voices coming from the room next door. Due to a shortage in facilities, the assessor told her and Daniel that the assessment room had been divided in two and without soundproofing â€“ so as Lucia had her medical, she could hear another disabled person being assessed. That would be uncomfortable for anyone, but for Lucia it was impossible: a symptom of her PTSD is that she hears internal â€œvoicesâ€\\x9d and conversations. As Lucia began to shake and cry, Daniel was told no other rooms were available. The assessor offered to reschedule the appointment but as having to go through an assessment again would further trigger Luciaâ€™s condition, she had no choice but to continue. â€œI was trapped,â€\\x9d she says. For the rest of the assessment, Lucia had to answer the assessorâ€™s questions with earphones in, playing music from an MP3 player to distract herself from the voices with calming â€œwhite noiseâ€\\x9d. â€œI couldnâ€™t concentrate. I went blank,â€\\x9d she says. â€œDaniel had to help me with responses. I donâ€™t even remember it.â€\\x9d The next day, Daniel wrote to Atos on behalf of Lucia about their concern that this situation would affect the result. A week later, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) informed Lucia sheâ€™d been rejected for PIP. Sheâ€™d scored zero points in the assessment. â€œTo have your decision based on such a flawed assessment is ridiculous,â€\\x9d Lucia says. â€œThey should have cancelled before I got there. They knew [my condition]. They knew what would happen.â€\\x9d But she tells me the report by Atos barely mentions any of it. â€œ[The report has] one sentence: â€˜The claimant had difficulties with this assessment.â€™ Thatâ€™s it. The only reference to the room,â€\\x9d she says. â€œI had a complete breakdown in the medical and they didnâ€™t even put that in.â€\\x9d Now without her benefit, she has no way to pay the Â£45 needed each week for her therapy. â€œI had my last session on 11 April when my last DLA went out. I donâ€™t have PIP, so I canâ€™t have it,â€\\x9d she says. She pauses. â€œIâ€™ve had a relapse â€¦ My symptoms are getting worse. I only ever felt able to go out with my husband and now it feels impossible. Itâ€™s taking so much effort just to function.â€\\x9d Among all the rhetoric on so-called â€œbenefit reformâ€\\x9d, what the Conservatives donâ€™t mention is that DLA â€“ and now PIP â€“ is whatâ€™s in technical terms â€œa gateway benefitâ€\\x9d. That means that when disabled people such as Lucia are rejected for transferring to PIP, they donâ€™t just lose DLA â€“ they can also lose several other benefits that theyâ€™ve been relying on for years. As Lucia puts it to me: â€œItâ€™s a bit like dominos.â€\\x9d The same day her DLA was stopped, Danielâ€™s carersâ€™ allowance was too. Because that went, so did Luciaâ€™s income support. The coupleâ€™s housing benefit was also suspended (itâ€™s since been reinstated after the council assessed them as needing support). In the space of a day, Lucia says, â€œeverything that we had before has stoppedâ€\\x9d. Thatâ€™s almost Â£300 a week. â€œWeâ€™re not living. Weâ€™re just surviving.â€\\x9d Currently, this survival is coming from money they saved from the previous monthâ€™s DLA â€œin case the worstâ€\\x9d happened with PIP. Lucia knows this will soon run out and the couple is now cutting back on food. â€œWeâ€™re lucky because thereâ€™s a place down the road that sells food past its best-before date so itâ€™s still legal to sell it,â€\\x9d she says. Lucia plans to appeal against her rejection for PIP but before she can, she must first go through what the DWP call mandatory reconsideration â€“ a compulsory process where the decision is â€œreconsideredâ€\\x9d. She receives no money in the meantime. â€œThey backdate it if you win but what goodâ€™s that now?â€\\x9d she says. â€œIt should only take a month. Now [they say] itâ€™s nine weeks because of a lack of staff. They say theyâ€™ve got more work than they were expecting.â€\\x9d It took until last Wednesday for Lucia and Daniel to get a reply from Atos â€“ weeks after sheâ€™d already been rejected. The firm apologised and said the room division was a temporary measure (that wonâ€™t be repeated) caused by a lack of available computers. When I contacted Atos, a spokesperson told me that theyâ€™d reviewed the assessment report produced â€œwhich was appropriately detailed and justifiedâ€\\x9d. But taking into account the concerns raised, they will now ask for Luciaâ€™s case to â€œbe sent back to us so that we can look to schedule a reassessment as a home consultationâ€\\x9d. They apologised again. â€œThey were under pressure to have that appointment then. Thatâ€™s what it felt like,â€\\x9d Lucia says. â€œEveryoneâ€™s under pressure. The government set the targets and Atos follow.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Scientists edge closer to creating effective Zika virus vaccine Scientists have edged closer to an effective Zika virus vaccine after demonstrating that three different formulations can protect monkeys from the disease. The results suggest that the virus can be repelled by even low levels of immunity and have boosted confidence that a viable vaccine for humans is on the horizon. Tests on 16 animals found that all three experimental vaccines offered complete protection against Zika infection one month later, though how long the protection could last for remains an urgent question for longer-term trials. â€œWe donâ€™t want to overstate it, but we hope for protection that is long-lasting,â€\\x9d said Dan Barouch, who co-led the studies at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. â€œIdeally weâ€™d have protection induced by a single shot vaccine or a two shot vaccine and for that to last for years.â€\\x9d When vaccinated, the animals churned out antibodies that were more than sufficient to overwhelm the virus. The Zika virus has swept through Latin America and left behind a trail of birth defects, such as microcephaly, which causes children to be born with small heads. This week, Florida reported the first US cases of local transmission of Zika virus. All previous cases were in people who had travelled to affected regions. Of the three vaccines tested by Barouch and others, the most conventional and ready for development is a whole, killed Zika virus, which is being pursued by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland. The other two vaccines are more novel. In one, a single and harmless Zika virus gene is stitched into a loop of DNA. When injected into the body, cells take up the DNA loop and from it produce Zika proteins that trigger an immune response against them. The third and final vaccine adds the Zika virus gene to a harmless adenovirus. This behaves like a Trojan horse and smuggles the DNA into cells, which then produce antibodies to wipe out the whole virus. No DNA or adenovirus vaccines have been approved for use in humans before, but clinical trials are underway. The vaccine based on the whole, killed virus will go into human trials this autumn. Barouch said the findings increase optimism that a safe and effective human vaccine against Zika virus might be successful. â€œOur data encourage the development of these vaccines in clinical trials as quickly as possible,â€\\x9d he said. Details are reported in the journal Science. Gavin Screaton, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the results were â€œpositive early stepsâ€\\x9d, but whether the vaccines will work in humans and offer long term protection against Zika must still be determined. â€œA human response will need to last years to be useful,â€\\x9d he said. Despite the encouraging progress, the path to a viable vaccine in humans may not be straightforward. Recent work by Screatonâ€™s group found that previous exposure to dengue virus could potentially make Zika infections more serious. If the opposite holds too, as some researchers suspect, a vaccine that floods the body with antibodies against Zika virus could make common dengue infections life-threatening. The problem arises because Zika and dengue, which both belong to a group called flaviviruses, are so similar at the genetic level. This can confuse the immune system. Should a person catch dengue and later catch Zika virus, their body may attempt to fight off Zika with â€œoldâ€\\x9d antibodies raised against dengue. Rather than overwhelming the Zika virus, the antibodies might simply draw them into cells and cause the infection to take hold more quickly. Known as cross-reactivity, this raises a second potential hurdle: a person who has fought off dengue or similar flavivirus infections may have antibodies that destroy the Zika vaccine before it has had time to work. Another issue scientists face comes from the natural immunity people will acquire to Zika as the infection spreads through the population. When people are already immune to a virus, it can be very hard to tell whether a vaccine on trial is helping to protect them. â€œWhilst these vaccine studies are promising there are some really important questions that need to be addressed,â€\\x9d said Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham.',\n",
              "  'Marouane Fellaini and Robert Huth banned for three matches over clash Marouane Fellaini and Robert Huth have accepted three-match bans after deciding not to contest their charges of violent conduct. The pair were charged by the Football Association after an off-the-ball incident during the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday, when the German defender pulled the Manchester United midfielderâ€™s hair and Fellaini responded with an elbow to the face. The incident was not seen by match officials but was caught on video. Fellaini is still available for the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace because United, who are fifth in the table, have three league games left. Fellaini will miss the visits to Norwich and West Ham before the home game against Bournemouth on the last day of the season as United chase Champions League qualification. Huthâ€™s team Leicester, who were crowned champions on Monday, play Everton and Chelsea. The United manager Louis van Gaal had earlier defended the Belgian midfielder by saying: â€œItâ€™s not in the books that someone has to grab by the hair and then pull it behind â€“ only in sex masochism.

              "  'Will politicians use this time to swap poison for serious debate? On the recommendation of a Labour veteran, who had already spotted that she was a star in the making, Iâ€™d got to know Jo Cox a little since she arrived in parliament. Everything that everyone has said about her is true. She was a dedicated local MP, extremely proud to represent the part of Yorkshire where she grew up. She fizzed with a zest to make a difference. She was very engaging, not least because she put so much effort into engaging with others. So it is right that her killing should be the prompt for deep soul-searching about how casually we, as a country, have been seduced by the corrosive cliches about all our politicians being worthless or worse. As in every walk of life, so with MPs. There are excellent ones and there are rotten ones. They are human beings, in her case, a highly impressive example of humanity. The very fact that she was killed outside a constituency surgery held in a public library gives the lie to another lazily destructive trope about politicians: that they are all members of an â€œout of touchâ€\\x9d elite engaged in a wicked and treacherous conspiracy against the people. Here was an MP trying to serve her people. Here was an MP killed doing her job. Iâ€™d add a couple more things about her. While she was serious about her causes, she also appreciated that modern politics is often a surreal comedy and sometimes the only way to cope with its absurdities is to embrace them. The day before her killing, Nigel Farage took his mini armada of Outer boats down the Thames for one of the funnier stunts of the referendum campaign. Jo waved off her husband, Brendan, as he went down the river with their two children to join the rival flotilla mustered by the In crowd. A boat from the Farage gang showed what lovely people they are by hosing the Cox family with grey Thames water. She also understood that politics is complex. She didnâ€™t pretend that every question has glibly simple answers and that she was already in possession of them all. She worked with politicians from other parties. She was passionate for her causes, but also collaborative and consensual, not an especially fashionable style at the moment. Sheâ€™d worked for aid agencies for more than a decade, often in some of the worldâ€™s most dangerous conflict zones. She represented one of the less privileged parts of Britain. She knew that life throws up choices that are rarely straightforward and anyone telling you there are instant solutions to difficult challenges is either a liar or a fool. Which unavoidably draws us to contrast her approach to public service with the poisons brought forth during the debate over Europe. Let me be clear. I am not making a causal link between her death and the toxic manner in which the campaign has been conducted, though you may be struck by the hypersensitive reaction from Leave propagandists when anyone suggests that there might be a link. I am saying that her example demonstrates that British democracy can be a whole lot better than the ugliness with which we have been assailed during this campaign. You will have probably gathered by now that I think this is the most significant choice for our country in at least a generation and that it would be bad for Britain, Europe and the world if we amputated ourselves from our continent. I have also acknowledged that there are cons as well as pros to membership. A referendum campaign that served this country well would have seen a rational debate grounded in the facts to help the British people make an informed decision about which of the options on the ballot paper was the best for their countryâ€™s future. That we have not had from a campaign dominated by the stoking and exploitation of fear. There is fault on both sides. The Remain campaign has not always been a source of pristine information, nor has it been strong on a positive vision. The Inners defined their task as making Brexit sound as scary as possible. Some of their forecasts of the impact of departure have been reasonable; some have escalated into hyperbole. But the Outers, with their ruthless endeavour to crush any rational debate, have been so much worse. The way they have conducted their campaign has increasingly suggested that they have consciously attempted to destroy intelligent argument by unleashing nihilism. The governor of the Bank of England cautions that Brexit will be a hazard to trade, investment and jobs. He is perfectly entitled to do that, just as the Outers are perfectly entitled to challenge his analysis. But thatâ€™s not what they do. They try to shout him into silence by disputing his right to express an opinion and denounce him as a mouthpiece for a sinister plot against the people. The boss of the NHS says he thinks Brexit would not be good for the health service. Do the Outers argue with his assessment? No, they venomously dismiss him as another establishment lackey. He, along with all the professional bodies in the NHS, is just an operative of the conspiracy against the people that is apparently so vast that it also encompasses the Greens, the Lib Dems, the Nationalists, Jeremy Corbyn and the major trade unions. The impeccably independent Institute for Fiscal Studies is another voice of caution about the consequences of Brexit. Do the Outers engage with the analysis? No, they denounce the IFS as yet another stooge of Brussels, a claim so ludicrous that even some Outers are too embarrassed to repeat it. The president of the United States joins the chorus of friendly foreign countries saying that they believe the smart choice for Britain is to stick with the EU. Is the most powerful man on the planet engaged with on a rational level? No, he is sneeringly dismissed by Boris Johnson on the grounds that he is â€œpart-Kenyanâ€\\x9d. We can see why the Outers chose this course. They saw a path to victory by feeding on and amplifying the anti-politics mood that seethes in an angry segment of the electorate. When you have so little expert opinion on your side of the argument, I suppose your only recourse is to trash the very notion that anyone can possess expertise about anything. â€œThe people of this country have had enough of experts,â€\\x9d scoffed Michael Gove when the lord chancellor struck his implausible pose as the tribune of the oppressed against the elite. Does he really think that expertise has no value? Of course not. Should he ever need a medical operation, I fancy Mr Gove will seek the services of a surgeon, not hand the scalpel to Nigel Farage and ask his new best mate to do his worst. The Outers have had another calculation as they spray everyone with their dirty water. Once you have created an anarchic world where no one has any authority to speak about anything, there is no one who can be trusted to offer any facts. In a fact-free, post-truth, Trumpian world â€“ they have borrowed liberally from his playbook â€“ you can make up anything you like in the pursuit of votes. Iâ€™ve covered a lot of campaigns and regularly been witness to the bending of the truth and sometimes the breaking of it. In my experience, though, the telling of bare-faced lies has been rarer in our politics if only for fear among its protagonists of what will happen to their credibility when they are found out. This campaign has introduced a novelty to British politics: the persistence with a lie even when it is verifiably a lie. The Out campaign know that the number on the side of their battle bus is a lie. But on the side of their bus that lie is still painted. The Outers know that it is a lie to say that Turkey is about to join the EU as it is also mendacious to suggest that 77 million Turks are on their way to the UK. Yet they persist with those whoppers too. Then there is the overarching duplicity of their campaign â€“ the mendacity that will haunt them and Britain if they win â€“ when they pretend that all the fears and resentments that they have exploited will magically evaporate if we choose Brexit. The more thoughtful people among the Outers might ask themselves whether they are really happy that the overall effect has been to depress respect for politicians on both sides. The suspension of campaigning is a last opportunity to rethink and reset. The life of Jo Cox is an example to us that we donâ€™t have to conduct our politics in such a malignant way. She crackled with passion for her causes. She also pursued them through persuasion and reasoned argument that had respect for both the facts and the right of others to hold a contrary opinion. That has usually been the British way of democracy. You might even say it has been the genius of British democracy. I agree with those who say that her death should force some reflection on the way we conduct politics. If that is to mean something, when campaigning resumes, the debate ought to be concluded in a serious way that reflects the gravity of the question confronting the United Kingdom. The economy, security, immigration and influence are all on the ballot paper on Thursday. Thereâ€™s something even larger there too. We will be saying what sort of country we are and want to be.',\n",
              "  \"Trump supports Dakota pipeline â€“ but claims it's not due to his investment in it Donald Trump has said he supports a controversial oil pipeline that runs next to a Native American reservation in North Dakota â€“ a project that the president-elect is personally invested in. A briefing from Trumpâ€™s transition team said that the real estate magnate supports the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline and that his backing â€œhas nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americansâ€\\x9d. Financial disclosure forms released earlier this year show that Trump has a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, and Phillips 66, which will hold a share of the project once completed. Trumpâ€™s investment in Energy Transfer Partners dropped from between $500,000 and $1m in 2015 to between $1,500 and $50,000 this year. His stake in Phillips 66, however, rose from between $50,000 and $100,000 last year to between $250,000 and $500,000 this year, according to the forms. The financial relationship has run both ways. Kelcy Warren, chief executive of Energy Transfer Partners, gave $103,000 to elect Trump and handed over a further $66,800 to the Republican National Committee after the property developer secured the GOPâ€™s presidential nomination. However, Trumpâ€™s transition team dismissed any conflict of interest. â€œThose making such a claim are only attempting to distract from the fact that president-elect Trump has put forth serious policy proposals he plans to set in motion on day one,â€\\x9d said a briefing note that was sent to campaign supporters. Mary Sweeters, a spokesperson for Greenpeace, said Trumpâ€™s support showed that â€œcrony capitalism will run his administrationâ€\\x9d. â€œThis is the definition of corruption,â€\\x9d she said. â€œThe president of the United States should not be trading favors with oil and gas corporations. Millions of people will lose access to a clean water supply, including the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and the rest of America will face the impacts of catastrophic climate change from burning fossil fuels.â€\\x9d A protest camp has grown in North Dakota since April, amid fears that the $3.8bn Dakota Access pipeline will threaten the water and cultural artifacts of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The 1,170-mile pipeline will take oil from North Dakotaâ€™s Bakken fields to a refinery in Illinois and will cross the Missouri river â€“ the main source of water for the tribe. The long-running protest has unified Native American tribes against the project, with repeated clashes between protesters and police. This week, North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple ordered the immediate evacuation of the protest camp, amid accusations of police violence from the mass arrests and water cannon deployment that have echoes of the civil rights protests of the 1960s. Barack Obama has suggested that the pipeline be rerouted to allay the fears of tribes but Energy Transfer Partners has vowed to push ahead and has accused the federal government of imposing costly delays upon the project. Trump has promised an â€œAmerica firstâ€\\x9d energy policy that will attempt to boost domestic oil, coal and gas production. The president-elect has already stated he wants to â€œlift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects to move forwardâ€\\x9d, including the Keystone pipeline, another controversial fossil fuel project. North Dakota senator John Hoeven, a Republican, said that he met with Trump and successfully urged him to support the Dakota Access pipeline. â€œMr Trump expressed his support for the Dakota Access pipeline, which has met or exceeded all environmental standards set forth by four states and the Army Corps of Engineers,â€\\x9d Hoeven said. â€œAlso, it is important to know that the new administration will work to help us grow and diversify our energy economy and build the energy infrastructure necessary to move it from where it is produced to where it is needed. The result will be more jobs, a more vibrant economy and affordable energy for the American people.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Black magic surgeon: Doctor Strange brings the occult back to the big screen This weekâ€™s release of Marvelâ€™s latest, Doctor Strange, brings magic, sorcery, extra-dimensional travel and, most importantly, well-tailored robes into the comic book film universe. Those who are au fait with the paranormal tend not to be the heroes in stories like these. One need only think back to this summerâ€™s Ghostbusters reboot to recall a film in which science, reason and expensive technological breakthroughs triumph over mystical hoo-ha. But the whole point of Doctor Strange is that the titular protagonist enlightens himself through black magic. The character rose to prominence just as the American counterculture was beginning to dabble in forms of spirituality outside of the Judeo-Christian establishment. The adventures of Stephen Strange tapped into eastern mysticism, psychedelic trips into alternate realities, and the absolute certainty that there is more to existence than what you can see with your eyes. (In fact, Doctor Strange possesses a third eye â€“ the Eye of Agamotto, an amulet he wears around his neck that gives him special abilities such as time travel.) The mystical might not be in fashion today (save for your Williamsburg or Silver Lake denizens carving out a weekend to take ayahuasca), but in the 1960s it was at the forefront of the national conversation in the US. The world of the supernatural and the darkly spiritual loomed large on the pop culture landscape around the time of Doctor Strangeâ€™s creation. Acts such as the Doors, David Bowie and Jefferson Airplane were singing about all manner of mind-expanding experiences. Movies such as Rosemaryâ€™s Baby, the Exorcist, the Omen, the Wicker Man and the Devils portrayed black magic, paganism and the like in direct opposition to the benign tenets of Christianity. In these movies, the devil is real and he uses his power to seduce the physical realm with impunity. One could point to the fallout from the hippie movementâ€™s fascination with psychotropics and the aftermath of the Charles Manson killings as the impetus for the interest in such things, but Rosemaryâ€™s Baby (directed by Roman Polanski, whose pregnant wife Sharon Tate was a Manson victim) came out before Manson, Altamont and the end of the so-called Summer of Love. Unlike those films, which were targeted at adults, Doctor Strange was (and is) for children. Selling a story about black magic to kids was no easy feat, especially one that existed in an approximation of the real world rather than a made-up realm where the â€œnatural rulesâ€\\x9d, as theyâ€™re referred to in the Strange film, donâ€™t apply. In 1974, Steve Englehart, Neal Adams and Frank Brunner created the character Sise-neg (Genesis spelled backwards) in the pages of the Marvel Premiere series starring Doctor Strange. Sise-neg was a sorcerer rival of Strange who used time travel to destroy the universe, then recreate it in his image. In the end, he merely recreates the universe as it was, broaching the question of whether or not this being was actually God itself. The religious implications were so controversial that Marvel editor Stan Lee considered retracting the entire story until Englehart and Brunner published a fake letter from a fictional minister praising the work. Itâ€™s Doctor Strangeâ€™s connection to our conception of reality that opens him up to such criticism. Setting a fantasy story in a far-off land, alternative universe or parallel reality affords the writer a freedom from allegations of apostasy or heretical thinking. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Golden Compass and countless other stories that might seem blasphemous to the true believer get off the hook because they donâ€™t exist in our conception of reality. Often, these works dabble within a world that resembles the distant past, which further removes it from those thorny questions of divinity. Star Wars pulled off that sleight of hand while still getting to play around with sci-fi iconography by explaining in the first frame of the movie that it was a story from â€œa long time ago, in a galaxy far far awayâ€\\x9d. George Lucas could invent an entire religion that governs the fate of the universe while never once having to connect that to peopleâ€™s actual belief systems. Star Trek (and also Asimovâ€™s seminal Foundation trilogy), on the other hand, is a covertly atheist story about humanity overcoming conflict through science and reason. By the 80s, the Indiana Jones series posited that pretty much every religious or occult myth was real â€“ the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, Hinduism, etc. Does it matter that Jesus, Kali Ma and aliens from another dimension all exist? I guess not. Perhaps theyâ€™re all pals in some far-off land. In the 90s, The Blair Witch Project, The Craft, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the hugely popular X-Files series all carried the banner of the occult in culture. The X-Files made a lot out of the debate over faith v science and religion v the paranormal, often cracking the audience over the head with a giant wooden cross of thudding symbolism. In 2016, Charlie Brookerâ€™s Black Mirror generates scares by showing that our greatest inventions will be our undoing, or more accurately, that our hubris and desire to overcome our physical limitations are ultimately destructive â€“ a notion film-makers such as David Cronenberg were playing with parallel to the last occult boom in pop culture in the body horror works of Videodrome and Scanners. The occult retains a modicum of its power to terrify in the age of the iPhone, though. Even though the Blair Witch sequel/reboot failed to relaunch that franchise, 2015â€™s The Witch was very much in the tradition of the classic occult horror films while also succeeding at the specialty box office. The Doctor Strange film digs up these old-timey notions of spirituality and inverts them. Here, the occult can set you free. It can be used to save humanity. More importantly, it exists in a world very much like our own. Sure, Doctor Strange hangs out in the Sanctum Sanctorum and his battles with Dormammu or Baron Mordo usually take place in some other realm, but that Sanctum sits on Bleecker Street in a fictional version of the real Manhattan. Heâ€™s just a regular guy who learned to manipulate the spiritual realm through years of study, not a wizard designated as such by genetics. Notions like fate and familial superiority, which are prevalent in Star Wars and Harry Potter, are forsaken in favor of the more traditionally puritanical American ideal of hard work. His sidekick, Wong, might tell him heâ€™s born to study the mystical arts, but thatâ€™s not because his dad was a sorcerer. There may not be the hi-tech gadgets of something like Ghostbusters, but Doctor Strange shares with those futuristic paranormal fantasies the idea that no matter what the discipline, knowledge is power.',\n",
              "  'I wish I could do more to protect your loved ones in mental health crisis Iâ€™m the worker you donâ€™t want turning up on your doorstep: it means you, or someone you love, is severely mentally unwell, possibly suicidal or experiencing severe psychosis. I work in an NHS mental health crisis team; we visit people at home to try to help them through their darkest times, as an alternative to sending them to a psychiatric hospital. We use talking therapies, deliver medication and monitor whether people take it, and address issues such as debt, drug use, homelessness, abuse and isolation. Sometimes weâ€™re simply there with someone. Itâ€™s a difficult job, but I love it. I have been yelled at, ignored, pleaded with, chased out of homes and thanked â€“ sometimes all by the same person. There are lows, like finding Mariam collapsed on her living room floor after an overdose, unable to cope with her isolation, bullying family and attacks from her abusive ex-husband. But itâ€™s worth it for the highs of seeing her two-year old daughter, Asma, regain a functioning parent after support has been put in place. We probably all know someone affected by mental health problems: one in four of us experience them at some point in our lives. Working with Matthew, for example, taught me that no one is immune, even if they are relatively well-off and well-educated. A consultant oncologist, he began planning his suicide after financial pressures and the shock of retirement caused him a psychotic depression, making him paranoid about his family and anyone trying to help him. Threats to your housing and income â€“ which are becoming increasingly commonplace â€“ increase your susceptibility to mental health problems, as well as making it harder to access help. It is very difficult, for instance, for my team to make appointments with Alex, a young homeless woman with a criminal record and without a mobile phone, who suffers horrific hallucinations of abuse. We try regardless, but the cuts affecting homelessness provision, income support and rehabilitation programmes are making it harder. Mental health is severely underfunded compared with physical health. Responsible for 22.8% of the disease burden in the UK, mental illness receives just 11.1% of the NHS budget, according to a 2013 paper from the Royal College of Psychiatrists (pdf). With so few hospital bed spaces for mental health patients, very unwell people can be left waiting for days or weeks at home, in police cells or in hospital A&E departments, while we look for a safe place they can stay. I remember Andrew, a man with a history of attempted suicide who was staying in a shed at the bottom of a friendâ€™s garden after losing his job, family and home. He took long walks every day to distract himself from suicidal thoughts, but sometimes his walks took him dangerously near a cliff edge. It was weeks before we could find a hospital bed for him, as other patients kept taking priority. As a professional, and as a human being, it is terrifying to be forced to take risks with someoneâ€™s life like that. We always put our written plans in place to show weâ€™ve managed the risk as best as we can â€“ also known as covering our backs â€“ but ultimately if someone dies in such a situation we would certainly feel morally culpable, if not legally liable. Cuts are also impacting on our ability to provide long term support. Anna, a young woman with a history of childhood abuse and trauma, who lives precariously in and out of various hostels until they get sick of her challenging behaviour, often calls my team when she feels at risk of seriously harming herself. We do our best to talk her through it, but sometimes she is already at the point of jumping off a tall building when she phones, and we need to get the police involved to ensure her immediate safety. We can help a little in the short term, but really she needs intensive therapy and a secure living environment â€“ preferably all in one place â€“ to help her deal with her past and develop better ways to cope and move on with her life. Such placements are few, far between and expensive, and pointless debates about whether itâ€™s the NHS or social services who should pay for it do not speed up the process of finding somewhere for her. Meanwhile, police, ambulance and crisis team resources are all being used inappropriately. In a recent costly and short-sighted reorganisation, my team was asked to do more work with the same budget. Unqualified staff took on tasks previously done by nurses, social workers and occupational therapists. They are working for less money, including night and weekend shifts for no extra pay: no junior doctorsâ€™ strike has protected them. We lack even basic resources like seats and desks: staff are forced to work on laptops in public areas. One of my experienced colleagues, Andrea, stays late for hours after every shift, comes in on her days off, and phones up at night to ask whoever is on duty to check on her patients. Not only her emotional wellbeing, but her judgement is being affected: it would be much better for her to share her workload with others more realistically. So much damage has been done to staff morale and turnover that many newer members of staff who started on poorer terms and conditions left very quickly, threatening consistency of care â€“ particularly vital with mental health when trust is so crucial to recovery â€“ and informal knowledge about people who use services is so important. When Martin, a regular caller, phones us he is often too distressed for even his name to be understood. Having someone on the other end of the phone who recognises his voice can make the difference between being helpful and being worse than useless. Like many of the people we try to help, my colleagues and I are engaged in a constant battle to stay positive. Despite the chaos of trying to function without enough resources, I know I still have a hugely rewarding job. I rarely get angry at patients shouting or threatening me, but Iâ€™m furious at seeing the skills, motivation and experience of my colleagues being thrown away for no good reason. If you are frustrated that not enough is being done to help your loved one, believe me, the people not doing enough are frustrated about it too. We wish our service was better, and weâ€™re pushing our managers and policymakers not to make cuts that will cost us all more in the long run. Although you might be fine right now, it doesnâ€™t take much for any of us to fall off the edge. If that happened to me, I know I would want to be with a dedicated, calm, and experienced person, with plenty of time to sit with me and try to help. So that is what I try to be.

              "  'Future of 4chan uncertain as controversial site faces financial woes The anonymous message-board site 4chan has come to represent the darkest corners of internet subculture, rife with the misogyny, web taste and the politically incorrect humor of the alt-right. Now it appears to be in financial trouble, according to the siteâ€™s new owner, Hiroyuki Nishimura, who said on Sunday that the site can no longer afford â€œinfrastructure costs, network fee, servers cost and CDN [servers that help distribute high-bandwidth files such as video]â€\\x9d. The post begins: â€œThank you for thinking about 4chan. We had tried to keep 4chan as is. But I failed. I am sincerely sorry.â€\\x9d Nishimura outlined three options for the future of the site: halving traffic costs by limiting upload sizes and closing some boards, adding many more ads including pop-up ads, or adding more paid-for features and â€œ4chan passâ€\\x9d users. An unlikely savior for the site may have already emerged in the form of Martin Shkreli, the controversial former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who rose to fame after his company bought the patent to an HIV drug and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill, causing mass outrage. Shkreli announced on Twitter that he was â€œopen to joining the board of directors of 4chanâ€\\x9d. He then reached out to Nishimura directly, who responded: â€œI have replied your DM. Thank you for supporting 4chan @MartinSkreli.â€\\x9d 4chan was founded in 2003 by an American schoolboy, Chris Poole, as an English-language version of popular Japanese image-sharing board 2chan, and split into a number of sub-category boards based on interest, many of the most popular ones pornographic. It was sold by Poole to Nishimura, the founder of 2chan, in 2015. Nishimura did not respond to requests by the to comment. The siteâ€™s influence in shaping the identity and culture of the internet as we know it today is vast. It is the internetâ€™s sweaty engine-room. It has birthed global movements: the hacktivist group Anonymous originated here, and the group is named for the â€œAnonymousâ€\\x9d tag attached to 4chan posts. More recently its anonymous message boards, especially the far-right leaning politics board /pol/, gave early succor to GamerGate and its spawn, the so-called alt-right movement, which have emerged in 2016 to ally themselves with Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign. It produced Pepe, the frog meme that was picked up by white supremacists and trolls and was later condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate symbol. Pepe is by no means the only meme 4chan has produced. Rickrolling (the practice of tricking someone into clicking on a link leading to a video of Rick Astleyâ€™s Never Gonna Give You Up, leading to nearly 250m views on YouTube and an unlikely revival of Astleyâ€™s career), LOLcats, and innumerable other memes and slang and inside jokes originated here. It is the internetâ€™s id, a place where anonymity runs free in its purest form. The true nature of mankind can be glimpsed there, in all its horror and glory and depravity. Predictably, the response to Nishimuraâ€™s message on the site was mixed. Posters from some boards â€“ many of which have loyal, almost tribal user-bases â€“ called for other boards to be closed. One suggestion was to close /b/, the wildly popular random topic board, to which other users expressed immediate worry that /b/ users would spread to other boards. â€œOh godâ€\\x9d, one posted. â€œHOW MANY PORN BOARDS DO WE NEED? NOT THIS MANYâ€\\x9d read another post. Some heatedly discussed the perils of pop-up advertising, while a few suggested merchandising as a way to solve the siteâ€™s revenue problems. Others just seemed worried. â€œPlease donâ€™t fuck this website up for us,â€\\x9d one user plaintively posted. Another wrote: â€œHiro please. Donâ€™t ruin this for us. This is our only home.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Why donâ€™t I sleep well? You asked Google â€“ hereâ€™s the answer We all have different sleep patterns, and almost anyone can improve theirs. So letâ€™s begin with the three keys to better sleep which might work for an â€œaverageâ€\\x9d person. The first is a healthy life style. Youâ€™re more likely to sleep well if you eat healthily, exercise, and have time for a good social and/or family life. Good nutrition and food habits benefit all bodily functions, including sleep and health; exercise helps reduce stress; and good relationships do the same â€“ while also improving mood, and enabling relaxation before sleep. The second key is the length of time you sleep, with about eight hours a night being a good amount for the average person. Donâ€™t be surprised if you sleep less though. Most working people in modern society are sleep deprived by an hour or two each day. But six hours of sleep is too little. Sleep matters more than we realise, so making time to sleep for about eight hours is good advice for almost everyone. The third key is the time you try to go to sleep (if you think of shift work and the problems this causes people, itâ€™s obvious that this is important). Most people have two different time patterns â€“ one during the working week, the other for weekends and holidays. Itâ€™s no surprise that holiday timing is better for sleep. As a rule of thumb, waking at 8am and going to sleep at midnight is about right for the average person. You may need to adjust these timings if youâ€™re different from the norm. Some of us are morning types (naturally getting up and going to sleep earlier) and others are evening types (naturally getting up and going to sleep later). These types are formally known as chronotypes. To find out if you are a morning type (â€œlarkâ€\\x9d) or evening type (â€œowlâ€\\x9d) itâ€™s worth looking up the MCTQ short questionnaire. This is probably the best way for a morning person to find out accurately if they are an extreme early, very early, early, slightly early or normal type â€“ and find appropriate sleep timings (the same applies for evening types). These timings are given in the MCTQ results: the average person wakes at 8-9am and goes to sleep at midnight to 1am. In contrast, some extreme early types wake at 5am and go to sleep at 9pm. This shows the huge difference between chronotypes that occur naturally in a large population. These differences can affect many people. For example, some moderate late types would wake up at 11am and go to sleep at 3am, if allowed to adhere to their natural rhythms, and this group makes up more than 5% of the population. Of course, these MCTQ timings are not rigid rules, only a rough measure of times to guide you to understanding your own sleep better. They might also help you understand people in your family. This is particularly true for teenagers and young adults whose sleep patterns can alter to dramatically later times. Letâ€™s consider some examples. Ella is in her 30s, and works in a busy office in London. â€œUntil two years ago,â€\\x9d she says, â€œI could sleep like a baby for 14 hours, but I think stress and the occasional glass of wine have had an impact on my sleep. What I find now is that itâ€™s not hard to get to sleep, but I wake up three or four times during the night, and never feel hugely rested in the morning. I donâ€™t remember the last time I had a full, uninterrupted nightâ€™s sleep. And in terms of the times I sleep best, Friday night is definitely always the best, and Sunday night is the worst.â€\\x9d Ella is typical in many ways. People working in busy office jobs are very frequently stressed, and on Friday nights they sleep best, because there is less stress, while on Sunday night the prospect of a demanding week causes poor sleep. Alcohol tends to lead to disrupted sleep, not to relaxing into good sleep. External pressures from Ellaâ€™s work are causing a problem â€“ and drinking before sleep makes it worse. Annie works in the same office as Ella, and says sheâ€™s suffered from insomnia since she was a teenager. â€œI wake up at 3am, and canâ€™t get back to sleep. This used to stress me out, which obviously exacerbates the problem, so as Iâ€™ve got older Iâ€™ve stopped worrying about it so much. This doesnâ€™t make the problem better, but it means I just accept that there are nights when I wonâ€™t get a good enough sleep. Sunday night is always my worst nightâ€™s sleep, and I try to be strict with myself â€“ I stop myself going online for a few hours before I go to bed, and I donâ€™t read anything work-related in that period either. I try to avoid email, especially, because thereâ€™s always pressure to get back to emails immediately, and once youâ€™re in that zone, youâ€™re wired.â€\\x9d  Annie took the MCTQ test, and this showed she is an early type, who would, if left to her own devices, naturally wake up earlier than 85% of the population. This would have been particularly striking as a teenager, feeling tired and ready for sleep when everyone else was staying up later and later. She is very perceptive in her acceptance of her sleep patterns, especially her sleeplessness, and when it comes to Sunday nights, her strictness with herself is excellent â€“ we should all do that. Understanding your sleep can put things in context. The next step is to consider whether there are changes you can make to your daily life that will help you sleep well. You can probably make a list based on the three keys: better lifestyle, making eight hours of sleep possible, and knowing your chronotype. What next? Work or education timings are the biggest barrier to good sleep in modern society. This is because the start times are generally too early. For example, if you are an average person, your wake time would be about 8am. If your current job starts at 8 or 9am, it isnâ€™t possible to keep to this wake time and be on time. These early starts punish almost everyone: the employee (too little sleep leads to poorer performance and greater health risks), the employer (as staff are not at their best), and the shareholders (as productivity wonâ€™t be as high as it could be). Better work times are better for all. Even work shifts can be improved using staff chronotypes, as has been shown recently in Germany, where a brilliant sleep researcher called Till Roenneberg came up with the idea of using the chronotypes of workers in the steel industry to ensure that evening type workers did more night shifts, and early types did more early starts. The result? The workers sleep an hour longer each night and arrive at work feeling better. Greater flexibility regarding working hours makes sense, and is a growing trend. For example, a company in London called dRMM architects allows employees to manage their work hours â€“ as long as they meet their targets. If youâ€™re struggling with sleep, it might (depending on your situation) be worth asking your employer for a more flexible approach. And if you run a big business, consider flexible hours for employees, to boost productivity, health, mood and performance. If you work in education, itâ€™s worth actively looking at later start times for secondary students. There is a clear scientific case for later start times and an exciting opportunity to join Oxfordâ€™s project Teensleep, which is recruiting 100 secondary schools to try out 10am starts and sleep education in a random controlled trial to improve sleep, health and performance. If youâ€™re based in the US, try looking at Start School Later, a campaign to move school starting times to later than 8.30am. Seattle school district, for example, has just moved all its secondary school starts to a later time, recognising that early starts increase health risks and emotional harm, while lowering academic and sports performance. There are a number of other things you can do in your daily life to improve your sleep. Direct sunlight, especially in the morning, helps keep your sense of time tuned to the 24-hour day, so try to be outside then. In the last hour or two before your natural sleep time have a routine that helps you settle, such as a quiet, dark, comfortable bedroom. In the last hour, donâ€™t use screen technologies or bright lights. As a general rule, donâ€™t use drugs unless prescribed by your doctor. In the morning, donâ€™t use stimulants like cigarettes to wake you up, or depressants like alcohol and sleeping pills at night. Coffee and tea in the morning are fine. Sleep is only a part of our daily pattern of work and rest; tiredness and alertness; and the various 24-hour rhythms of our body. We tend to think differently about wake and sleep events, though there is no reason to do so. If you sleep in the day â€“ a nap â€“ we tend to think of it as a treat and wise. If we wake at night â€“ as most of us do â€“ then we can feel as if something is wrong and worry. So if you do wake up and canâ€™t sleep just then, get up and do something until you feel like going back to sleep. The benefits of sleep are now understood to include better memory, insight and health. Sleep helps clean our brains of toxins, and enables us to create long-term memories (while forgetting trivia). If you need more help, itâ€™s always worth talking to your doctor and getting their advice. Sleep is your friend: treat it well.',\n",

Like Kazakhstan â€“ two sides of which can be seen in the films of Yermek Tursunov: Zhat (Stranger) is a scenic wilderness adventure in the vein of Kurosawaâ€™s Dersu Uzala; and Little Brother (Kenzhe), an urban hitman thriller. There are also new features from Myanmar (monkâ€™s story Panchagavya), Tajikistan (rural womenâ€™s tale Chilla), Mongolia (rockumentary Live From UB) and even a short from Saudi Arabia. Offerings closer to the sort of thing you might expect include an eye-opening documentary on South Koreaâ€™s celebrity pro-gamers (State Of Play) and Japanese schoolgirl anime The Case Of Hana And Alice, while rising Chinese star Zhang Wei is one of many directors in attendance here, with his sweatshop social drama Factory Boss. Various venues, Mon to 28 Feb Borderlines Film Festival, Herefordshire, Shropshire & Powys Bringing relief to the arthouse-starved Welsh borders, this festival has a â€œletâ€™s put the film on right hereâ€\\x9d spirit, making use of village halls, community centres, theatres and whatever else is around. There are about 100 films in this yearâ€™s programme, mostly recent hits (Room, Joy, Youth), previews (High-Rise, Victoria, Son Of Saul) and world cinema with a rural bent (Icelandâ€™s Rams and Ethiopiaâ€™s Lamb would make a dream ovine double bill). In Hereford thereâ€™s also a Tarkovsky retrospective and a focus on Romani cinema, the latter of which brings unseen work such as Hamlet-inspired Slovakian drama Gypsy.

              "  'Ex-Co-op Bank chief barred from top accountants institute A former chief executive of the Co-operative Bank has agreed to a six-year ban from membership of a key accountancy body after admitting to misconduct during his tenure at the top of the troubled bank. Barry Tootell â€“ who has already been banned from holding senior roles in the City â€“ will not be able to describe himself as a chartered accountant after his exclusion from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). The Financial Reporting Council, which oversees investigations into misconduct and has made the recommendation to the ICAEW, will receive Â£20,000 from Tootell to help recoup costs. It is not clear how much the investigation cost. Other bans recommended by the FRC, which had considered a seven-year ban for Tootell, have ranged from three to 10 years. Tootell, who could not immediately be reached for comment, was finance director and then acting chief executive of Co-op Bank for 14 months. He took on the role full-time in September 2012 but was placed on gardening leave in May 2013 after the bank was downgraded to junk status. The bank, then fully owned by the Co-operative Group, later had to be bailed out by hedge funds when a Â£1.5bn hole appeared in its books in 2013 . Gareth Rees, FRC executive counsel, said: â€œThe period of exclusion imposed in this case sends a clear message to accountants of the high standards of professional conduct expected of them when undertaking important roles within business. â€œThe sanction reflects the significance of the misconduct by a CFO [chief financial officer] and CEO of a major UK bank, and the need to promote public and market confidence in the accountancy profession and the quality of corporate reporting in this sector. Mr Tootell engaged in the FRCâ€™s settlement process by accepting his misconduct, which has led to a considerable saving of time and cost.â€\\x9d Tootell was banned by the Bank of England â€“ along with Keith Alderson, who ran the Co-opâ€™s corporate and business banking division â€“ in January by its Prudential Regulation Authority. They were not found to have deliberately or recklessly breached the rules and the regulator did not make findings of dishonesty or lack of integrity. The FRC said the Bank of Englandâ€™s conclusions were â€œconclusive evidence of misconductâ€\\x9d. The Bank found Tootell contributed to a culture that focused on the short-term financial position (pdf) and did not adequately oversee the corporate loan book that the Co-op took on when it merged with Britannia in 2009. The period of censure covered January 2009 and May 2013. At the height of the Co-op bankâ€™s crisis, the then chancellor George Osborne announced an independent investigation into what went wrong. The review has not yet started as the Financial Conduct Authorityâ€™s investigation into individuals remains ongoing. The FRC said its investigation into the bankâ€™s auditors, KPMG, was also ongoing. Co-op bank, which reported a Â£177m loss for the first six months of the year, said the FRCâ€™s ruling was related to the way it had operated in the past. â€œWe have said before, the investigations by the regulators into what went wrong at the bank are very important. They indicate the extent of the previous problems at the bank and emphasise that the turnaround is a lengthy and difficult process,â€\\x9d the bank said. â€œThe findings relate to previous management and the current management team has, over the last three years, progressed the turnaround, having raised additional capital, achieved considerable de-risking, delivered mobile and digital banking capability and strengthened the bankâ€™s appeal to customers.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Bank of England bans two former Co-op Bank chiefs from top City jobs Two former bankers at the Co-operative Bank have been banned by the Bank of England from holding senior positions in the City after being found to have posed an unacceptable threat to the companyâ€™s financial position. The Bank is fining Barry Tootell, a former Co-op Bank chief executive, Â£173,802, and Keith Alderson, who ran the corporate and business banking division, Â£88,890. This is the first time Threadneedle Street has used its new powers to take action against individuals and Tootell is the first boss of any bank to be formally censured since the 2008 crisis. Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, said: â€œBanks that are not well governed have the potential to pose a threat to UK financial stability. The actions of Mr Tootell and Mr Alderson posed an unacceptable threat to the safety and soundness of the Co-op Bank, which is why we have decided a prohibition is appropriate in these cases.â€\\x9d The Co-op Bank had to be bailed out by hedge funds when a Â£1.5bn hole appeared in its books in 2013 . It also left the bank open to scrutiny of the way it was run; its former chairman Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister, was later ordered to pay Â£525 after admitting possession of drugs including cocaine and crystal meth. Tootell was acting chief executive for 14 months before getting the role full-time in September 2012 but was placed on gardening leave in May 2013 following the bankâ€™s downgrade to junk status. He was paid Â£623,000 by the time he formally left at the end of 2013. The Bank of Englandâ€™s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, found Tootell contributed to a culture at the bank that focused on the short-term financial position. The PRA said he did not adequately oversee the corporate loan book the Co-op took on when it merged with Britannia in 2009. The period of censure covers January 2009 and May 2013. It cites moves by him to change bad debt charges, which in one instance which had the effect of maintaining the bonus pool although the Bank does not say this was his motivation. Alderson, whose role has been subject to little public scrutiny until now, was found not to have properly assessed the risks from the Britannia loans nor escalated any concerns about the scale of impairments or bad debts. The regulator said his income was Â£423,000 and his period of censure covers August 2009 and May 2013. The PRA said: â€œThe Co-op Bankâ€™s culture resulted in an environment in which some staff felt under pressure to meet impairment forecasts that had previously been set .â€\\x9d The regulator accepted that Alderson did not intentionally place pressure on staff to modify the bad debt provisions and that the origins of the problem lay in the Britannia business. The Bank of England did not find Tootell or Alderson deliberately or recklessly breached the rules and did not make findings of dishonesty or lack of integrity in issuing the bans and fines. The Financial Conduct Authority is still investigating and a formal review promised in November 2013 by George Osborne into what went wrong at the bank cannot begin until the FCA has completed its work. â€œWe donâ€™t comment on individual cases. While we have previously indicated that work will not start on the review until it is clear it will have no prejudicial effect on any future cases, we are not at that stage yet,â€\\x9d the FCA said. In August, the two City regulators let the bank off a fine even though they found it had misled investors and pursued growth at the expense of its financial stability. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: â€œThe Prudential Regulatory Authority has censured two executives for putting short-term profits ahead of the long term sustainability of the bank, but there was clearly also a failure on the part of the whole board.â€\\x9d The Co-op Bank has already taken steps under previous rules to withdraw Â£5m of bonuses from a number of employees and there is no prospect of clawing back any more bonuses. â€œThe findings relate to previous management and the current management team continues to progress the turnaround, having raised additional capital, achieved considerable de-risking and improved brand metrics,â€\\x9d the Co-op Bank said.',\n",
              "  'EU referendum voter registration site crashes before deadline Members of the public attempting to register to vote in the EU referendum complained that the government website had crashed hours before the deadline. The development could mean that tens of thousands of potential voters may be disenfranchised and unable to cast a vote in what is expected to be closely fought contest. Voters have been encouraged to register before 11.59pm on Tuesday 7 June to be able to take part in the EU referendum. However, the Cabinet Office website would not allow voters to input their details at 10.40pm on Tuesday. A tweet from the Cabinet Office acknowledged that the site had crashed. â€œWeâ€™re aware of the technical issue on [the site]. Weâ€™re working to resolve it. This is due to unprecedented demand. Update soon,â€\\x9d it said. The online registration system was supposed to make it easier than ever for people living in England, Wales and Scotland to register. But on Twitter, users complained that the website crashed after the prime minister, David Cameron, and Ukip leader Nigel Farage took part in an EU referendum programme. Allison Pearson, the Telegraph columnist, wrote on Twitter that her husband had attempted to register at 10.45pm but had been unable to do so. â€œHimself trying to register to vote. â€˜Sorry, we are having technical problemsâ€™ 504 Gateway 504. Time-out impedes democracy.â€\\x9d Twelve minutes before the deadline, the Cabinet Office tweeted an apology. â€œSome people are getting through, sorry if you have experienced issues,â€\\x9d it said. The was alerted to the problem by a Liberal Democrat official who could not register. The Lib Dem Leader, Tim Farron, called for the deadline for registration to be extended. â€œThis is a shambles the government has presided over and people must be given an extra day to exercise their democratic right,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIt is also a major blow to the in campaign and our prospects of staying in Europe. â€œWith individual voter registration, and a big campaign to encourage young people to register, many of whom have been trying to do so last-minute, this could have major consequences for the result. â€œEvidence shows younger people are overwhelmingly pro-European, and if they are disenfranchised it could cost us our place in Europe. It could also turn them off democracy for life. Voters must be given an extra day while this mess is sorted out urgently.â€\\x9d Yvette Cooper, the former Labour minister, also called for the government to extend the deadline. â€œPeople cannot be denied the right to vote because computer says no,â€\\x9d she tweeted. Gloria De Piero, the shadow cabinet office minister, wrote that the Cabinet Office site showed that there were 26,629 people attempting to register six minutes before the midnight deadline. â€œGovernment MUST extend the deadline for 24 hours,â€\\x9d she wrote on Twitter. Ian Katz, the editor of Newsnight, wrote: â€œSeems traffic to voter registration site peaked at 22.15 when 50,000 were trying to register â€“ and site subsequently crashed.â€\\x9d Jeremy Cornbyn, too, added his voice to the calls for an extension to the deadline.',\n",
              "  'Brexit vote brings fresh surge of support for Scottish independence Liam McKeown has put the yes stickers back up in his windows. â€œI felt so angry I was in tears,â€\\x9d explained the social care worker, as he commiserated about the EU referendum result over a pint with fellow remain supporters in Glasgow. â€œBut then I heard Nicola Sturgeonâ€™s speech and I thought, bring it on.â€\\x9d McKeown was drinking on Friday evening at the Yes Bar, a kitschy Italian cafe-bar in the city centre that was named the Vespbar until the 2014 Scottish independence campaign, when it became a hub for activists and promptly changed its moniker. The owner of the bar, the SNP candidate and Women for Independence activist Suzanne McLaughlin, described the mood among her regulars on Friday. â€œThey were queuing outside when we opened. People just wanted to come together and talk about whatâ€™s happened.â€\\x9d The mood reminded her of 19 September 2014, she said, but with one crucial difference: â€œThese are different people saying theyâ€™ll vote for independence when they couldnâ€™t have before, and we have to welcome them with open arms.â€\\x9d Only a day later, the vote to leave the EU is changing the terms on which people are viewing independence. McLaughlin predicts: â€œIâ€™ve always supported independence for internationalist reasons, but that fear of isolation was the reason many people voted no last time. Thatâ€™s completely different now that weâ€™re leaving the EU. â€œA couple of weeks ago Iâ€™d have told you that we needed to wait another five to 10 years to build support [for a second independence referendum], but now I think we do it while people still feel this way.â€\\x9d Since the decision to leave the EU was confirmed in early on Friday morning, pro-independence political parties and campaign groups have reported a surge in support, both from traditional allies, galvanised by recent events, and new recruits. An SNP source said the party had been inundated with emails from people who had previously voted no, but wanted to pledge their support for a second referendum with the aim of keeping an independent Scotland part of the EU. The novelist and former columnist Jenny Colgan was an outspoken defender of the union in 2014. On Friday morning, she tweeted that she was crying with relief after listening to Nicola Sturgeonâ€™s promise to defend the aspirations of Scots who had voted to remain. She said: â€œMy reasons for voting no last time, because I didnâ€™t believe in separation and isolation, are what make me a yes voter now. I thought that it would be a hold-your-nose choice but actually Iâ€™m feeling quite excited that we have a way out of this horrible mess.â€\\x9d There is certainly an understanding within the SNP of the need to make a new offer on independence now it not only improves on the gaps in the 2014 argument, most obviously currency and oil, but is tailored to a Scotland remaining within the EU while England and Wales leave. A second general election in the autumn could afford the SNP the possibility of putting an even stronger commitment to a second independence referendum in another manifesto. There is also an acknowledgement, however, that the timing may be beyond the Scottish governmentâ€™s control, particularly if they are required to dovetail the referendum process with Brexit negotiations. Tommy Sheppard, one of the SNPâ€™s most prominent Westminster MPs, had been expected to take a leading role in the partyâ€™s summer independence drive, a project Sturgeon announced before Mayâ€™s Scottish parliament elections and aimed at building a consistent yes majority for the long-term. In a thoughtful and provocative article that some considered an early application for the post of SNP deputy leader following the resignation of Stewart Hosie last month, Sheppard identified a group he described as â€œthe I-curiousâ€\\x9d, people who were not ideologically opposed to independence, but had yet to be convinced on key questions such as currency and other economic concerns. He believes the Brexit vote will have swelled their ranks: â€œItâ€™s not the fact of Brexit but the political effect. We clearly do think that it will change the voting intentions of a significant number of those 2 million who voted no in 2014,â€\\x9d he said. â€œItâ€™s an insult to those people not to have the chance to reconsider now that the prospectus has changed. I think that most no voters made a considered judgment based on a number of factors, not least of which was remaining part of the EU.â€\\x9d He could well have been describing the Harry Potter writer, JK Rowling, who made substantial donations to the pro-union Better Together campaign in 2014, and wrote compellingly of her hope that Scotland would remain part of the UK. She shocked followers on Friday when she corrected a correspondent on Twitter: â€œ[Describing me as a] â€˜staunch opponentâ€™ implies I was pro-union no matter what, which was never the case. Many no voters will think again now.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Why I canâ€™t bank on Lloyds any more My bank is in an unprepossessing part of town. It squats, square and concrete, on a busy stretch of the long trunk road that links London to Birkenhead. It is flanked by a pound shop (outside which stands a large bucket of 99p mops) and a McDonaldâ€™s (outside which blow abandoned, still-warm, polystyrene burger tubs). If the litter bothers you, at least you can solve the problem immediately for only 99p. But I like it. When I was a child, this area was an exciting destination. To get there, you had to walk for 10 minutes up our residential road, then stand for an unpredictable amount of time at the bus stop opposite the â€œnaughty knickers shopâ€\\x9d (for reasons I may never understand, there were just two shops at the top of our road: a cheap Ann Summers knock-off underwear shop and a chemist. Very convenient for anyone who needed a pair of split-crotch scarlet pants, a packet of throat lozenges and nothing else at all). When the bus came, â€œone and a half ticketsâ€\\x9d were bought (or â€œone and two halvesâ€\\x9d, if my brother was of the party) and the journey tookâ€¦ well, that changed as traffic changed. When I was five years old, it was probably seven or eight minutes. By the time I was a teenager, it could be 40. At the end of this adventurous journey lay all the excitements of stationery, toys, records, perhaps a packet of Mintolas and a copy of Jackie. I donâ€™t think I understood that it wasnâ€™t an attractive shopping district. It was just exciting: colourful, busy, grown up. Nowadays, I only go there for the bank. The record shop, the toy shop and the bakery have long since closed; McDonaldâ€™s is no longer a destination restaurant for me (though might become so again, once my daughter has a full set of teeth) and the pound shop sells nothing you canâ€™t get at a proper hardware store for the same kind of money anyway. But I love that bank. I opened my first account at Lloyds when I was still at school, the year Great-Auntie Serena supplemented her traditional Christmas gift of cherry chocolates with a fat Â£10 cheque. I chose Lloyds because I liked the horse and Iâ€™ve never left. These days, everyone hates banking as a concept â€“ except those who continue to milk it for corpulent bonuses, I suppose â€“ but it is still possible, and too little discussed, to love a particular branch. Apart from the staff I know and like, I love the satisfying feeling of conducting business there: filling in forms with the special pen on a chain, sliding cheques under the partition window, collecting holiday money. Itâ€™s so grown up and yet, at the same time, so redolent of Mary Poppins. I donâ€™t care whether or not the boss of Lloyds had an extramarital affair. I donâ€™t care if he or anyone else breached expenses rules by spending Â£300 at the Mandarin Oriental spa in Singapore. I hate spas, all weird smells and impertinent prodding. This one apparently does a Â£150 â€œaromatherapy massageâ€\\x9d, which strikes me as punishment enough for any alleged transgressions. But I do care that my branch of Lloyds is closing down, along with 199 other branches nationwide with the loss of thousands of jobs. The letter Iâ€™ve just received advises me that â€œother ways to bankâ€\\x9d include the internet and the telephone. Thanks for pointing that out, guys! Frankly, it was irresponsible of you to give me a credit card if you think Iâ€™m such a f***ing moron. I donâ€™t think the branches are closing because the boss spent too much on massages. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re closing because of Brexit. I think theyâ€™re closing because of a failure of imagination at the top. Sure, the bean counters can save Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£s by locking doors, selling up and firing staff. Sure, most transactions can be done online. Sure, fewer of us are queuing up in person for day-to-day admin. But the existence of a local branch has a vital role, even if we never go in there: itâ€™s key to the illusion that money is a thing. Money is not, of course, a thing; itâ€™s an idea. But the illusion of thing-ness (which so nearly disintegrated when we caught that catastrophic glimpse behind the curtain in 2008) is vital to its desirability. Once we cease to desire it, the acquiescent balance of society is in grave danger. The pleasing physicality of banknotes, coins and cheque books is half gone already. The gold reserveâ€™s been sold. If the bricks-and-mortar banks, counters and partition windows, paper forms and special pens go with them, thereâ€™ll be nothing left to â€œmoneyâ€\\x9d but numbers on a screen. Only a mug would bother to keep paying fees for a bank account when the idea of a physical storage facility and physical guardians is so completely gone. And thenâ€¦ who cares? Who wants it? There is no â€œitâ€\\x9d anyway! The tenuous reasons to work long hours in a boring job, or to accept even theoretically a status quo where some people have private jets while others are homeless, disintegrate entirely. I am just not enough of an anarchist to hope this happens. Even if I were poor, I still wouldnâ€™t; Iâ€™d be frightened of looting, violence and social breakdown. If I were talking to whatever fat cat or bigwig waved through the closure of 200 more Lloyds branches, and the redundancy of thousands more workers, I would say: Donâ€™t be so sure you understand how this all works. Today, you make a saving; long term, you might lose everything. If you want to keep your padded arse in that padded chair, youâ€™d better leave those branches alone. Just sit quietly and keep on clapping like you believe in Tinkerbell.',\n",
              "  'Brexit brings call for change: has UK ignited battle for new EU? The German government has been canvassing support for a senior political leader to gather views in European capitals on a new future for the continent in the wake of the Brexit vote, with the aim of completing the task before the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome next March. EU heads of state, reeling from the UKâ€™s vote to leave the European Union, want to be seen to be responding to the Eurosceptic mood, and some want a new â€œvision for Europeâ€\\x9d document that distils the conflicting thinking. EU heads of government are due to gather in Bratislava for an informal summit on 16 September to discuss the fallout from Brexit, but mainly focused on how the EU will operate in the future, including what more it can do to reduce youth unemployment, straighten out the eurozone and strengthen security. In practice, the meeting may also see a first EU response to the election of a new Tory party leader, and the pace at which Brexit talks will take place. Those talks are to be led by a Belgian diplomat, Didier Seeuws, a former staffer for the former European council president Herman van Rompuy. A cacophony of political voices have been setting out their plans for Europe, and some have called for a European convention to discuss ideas. Germany was strongly opposed and successfully saw off calls for a fresh convention last week. Berlin has, however, been looking at a more informal process in which a leading politician seeks to distil the mood in the capitals of Europe. There is a strong desire not to leave the process in the hands of either the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and less so the council president, Donald Tusk. In a sign that Germany wants to be at the helm of the discussions, Sigmar Gabriel, the economics minister and leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), has floated a series of ideas to change Europe, including fewer commissioners and a slimmed down agriculture budget. He said the EU could not afford to give the UK concessions or else â€œthis will be an invitation to all the nationalist egotists in Europeâ€\\x9d. He also joined the German Greens in saying young UK citizens in France, Germany and Italy should be offered dual citizenship, as a way of keeping in touch with young Britons that back Europe. He was certain the UK had not left the EU for ever, saying: â€œI am sure this is an episode and not an epoch.â€\\x9d But the efforts to refound Europe, or at least respond to its unpopularity, are made more complicated by a string of national democratic elections in Italy, Holland, France and Germany that could see a major change in tone in one or other of their capitals. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has said he will resign if his constitutional reforms to transform the countryâ€™s senate into a â€œsenate of the regionsâ€\\x9d are rejected in a referendum that will be held by the end of October. The pro-British Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is trailing the anti-EU populist Geert Wilders in polls ahead of an election next March. The French presidential election, due next spring, may see the return of the mercurial Nicolas Sarkozy. He is producing a string of new ideas on the future of Europe, including reworking the governance of the eurozone so that it is dominated by France and Germany. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, currently facing a lot of the blame for Brexit, due to her rigidity on a range of issues, faces elections in the autumn.',\n",

Forget all about reading as a pleasure, forget that children should have unlimited access to books, throw away arguments about libraries being lifelines for those less fortunate â€“ theyâ€™re falling on deaf ears. You just have to look at the comments beneath pro-library articles to gather a general response: Kindles, the internet replacing information needs, and so on.

For me, it boils down to one important point: the internet is a shallow (but extremely wide) surface-level summary of secondary, often opinionated information that sits on a bedrock of substantive knowledge that either isnâ€™t on the internet, or lives behind a paywall, or is too expensive to purchase. Public libraries broker equal access to all that stuff. Get rid of them, and your information becomes drip-fed through Google filters (if you have a computer to access it). As a librarian, it will be my job to make sure those bridges are not burned, and that theyâ€™re well maintained and clearly marked, with delightfully efficient help points dotted along the way. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love the internet: its ability to navigate through information is a miracle of our time. But it is just as chaotic and alienating as the real world. Itâ€™s not a safe place â€“ youâ€™re just sitting and staring at a screen. A public library â€“ any library, really â€“ is more than that. Besides, libraries are good for children and those less fortunate than others. I know: I was that washed-up unfortunate once. When I was 18, I lost my home very suddenly â€“ I was forced to pack on a Wednesday before the locks were changed on a Thursday. My family split apart, and I experienced disorientating homelessness and financial oblivion. In this chaos my library came in pretty handy, with free internet, free books, staff expertise, signposting services. Some years later I came back to the library, while I was working for an agency, doing horrible, unskilled jobs in warehouses. I needed to keep my spirits afloat, so there I was again, browsing the books. When I think back, and see how often Iâ€™ve leaned on one library or another, I wonder where Iâ€™d be without them. Now I work in one and itâ€™s keeping the roof over my head. Libraries have been a safe zone for me, a kind of emotional and intellectual ground zero for the past 15 years. Every day I help people and wonder what on earth they would do without us. Libraries are an essential service. I know this because most of the people I help never thank me or my colleagues, or even acknowledge us. Why? Because they donâ€™t need to. The funny thing with essential services is that theyâ€™re taken for granted. A successful day in the library is one where people complain, like they would with any other local authority service. The Wi-Fi isnâ€™t good enough; there arenâ€™t enough academic texts; itâ€™s too cold; itâ€™s too loud; I donâ€™t know my email password; why donâ€™t you have this book? I love it. Complain and moan all you like â€“ itâ€™s your library service. Itâ€™s for you: take it, have it, use it. Iâ€™m your public librarian and this is your public library, and these are the hallmarks of public service. About the only drawback Iâ€™m finding is the (sometimes) well-meaning dismissiveness, particularly from my friends and family. A working-class male taking a degree to be a what? Sometimes, they just laugh. I could try to explain, but itâ€™s difficult when I hardly understand the profession myself. For them, working in a library is like working in a charity shop: a good cause, but not quite a real job. My hairdresser was surprised it was even paid work. Iâ€™m not sure how libraries got bound up in these stereotypes: Casanova was a librarian after all (a common cry of the defensive information professional). But thatâ€™s OK, it pays better than Pizza Hut, and thereâ€™s nothing else Iâ€™d rather be. I walked into a library as a young child and fell into a world bigger than anything I could have imagined.

              "  'Itâ€™s Twitterâ€™s 10th birthday. So do you love it or hate it? Abi Wilkinson: â€˜Twitter has allowed us to break into what seemed a closed shopâ€™ In 2009 I was lonely. Iâ€™d moved to a brand new city to start university and my boyfriend had decided to come with me. I found my study fascinating, but outside of three weekly hour-long seminars I had little access to people to discuss it with. When my boyfriend came home from work the last thing he wanted to do was dissect the finer points of political theory. He was also suspicious of my desire to make new friends and I eventually gave up on trying to socialise. Desperate to occupy my time, I created a Twitter account. It turned out to be exactly what I needed. Quickly, I became part of a community who chatted about all the same things I wanted to talk about. I could debate with Adam Smith Institute employees about Lockean property rights or argue with social conservatives about the broken windows theory. I had a new network of friends to natter about everyday things with. While my mates from home were busy drinking and flirting, I knew I could always go online and find someone to gossip and joke with. When I was feeling down, there would be someone there to lend a sympathetic ear. My relationship fell apart and I eventually threw myself into university life, but I didnâ€™t break the Twitter habit. I had friends on the other side of the world who knew more about my daily thoughts, feelings and concerns than anyone Iâ€™d ever been in a room with. When I finished university, it was Twitter that helped me find my first graduate job working for Trinity Mirror. Iâ€™d written a blog about a bad experience at the jobcentre so everyone knew I was looking for work. A friend directed my attention towards a tweet advertising a paid internship and pestered me to apply. Somehow, miraculously, I was offered a two-week trial. If youâ€™d asked me back in 2009 if I could imagine myself working in the media, Iâ€™d probably have laughed in your face. Many of the same people I remember tweeting with back then have jobs at newspapers and magazines. Twitter has allowed us to break into what seemed a closed shop. Obscure blogs can generate as much conversation as broadsheet leaders. Itâ€™s possible to catch the eye of commissioning editors even if you have no formal credentials. Looking back, itâ€™s hard to imagine what my life would be like if Twitter had never existed. Maybe Iâ€™d have flunked out of university. Perhaps Iâ€™d still be stuck in an unhappy relationship. Certainly, I doubt my career would have gone the way it has. On the 10th birthday of the social network, I suppose itâ€™s really about time I said thanks. Steven Baxter: â€˜Iâ€™m stuck in a toxic relationship with a little bird iconâ€™ Twitter is a sickness. Iâ€™m stuck in a toxic relationship with a little bird icon on my telephone. I need help â€“ and so do you. I loved that little tweety bird once. I craved the gold sticker of a retweet or the pat on the head of a favourite. I tried everything â€“ puns, hashtag games, memes, pretending to know about American politics â€“ just for the thrill of being read by a stranger. But it all got too much. There are many bad things about Twitter â€“ from the open sewer of racism and abuse to the horrendous blue-ticked cliques squawking at each other, from snarky subtweets to heartbreaking unfollows from people you like â€“ but if I could pick one downside as the worst, it would be the Plague of Angry Eggs. At first, when you have a relatively popular tweet (say more than 25 RTs), itâ€™s exciting. Youâ€™ve made it. â€œI once got retweeted by a minor celebrity!â€\\x9d you tell your friends â€“ if you have any left now that youâ€™re staring at the people in your telephone every 10 seconds. Then reality kicks in. Tweeting can be like dangling your meat-smeared genitals through the bars at the zoo and whistling cheerily at the ravenous wolverines. The Angry Eggs take issue with what youâ€™ve said, a particular word, your choice of profile picture or a grammatical error, and your joy is over. Hatred and finger-wagging pollutes your @-mentions. You tweeted something six years ago that contradicts your tweet! Aha! I managed a Twitter flounce, once, loudly announcing I was leaving the party and attempting to cause a scene. No one particularly noticed. â€œRealâ€\\x9d life carried on and was rather refreshing without constantly having to tell the people in my telephone every thought in my head. But I needed my fix. I sneaked back. I blocked all the irritants I could think of â€“ your Hopkinses, your Blunts. I deleted all tweets every two weeks, but that wasnâ€™t enough. I tried to keep my thoughts to myself as much as possible and stop craving retweets and likes. But I couldnâ€™t help myself. The Plague of Angry Eggs was still there as well, and in greater numbers. My nemesis. Just waiting in the shadows for me to say something in order to disagree with it without reading it properly, or wilfully misunderstand the point of a joke. And yet, I just canâ€™t seem to quit.',\n",
              "  'Germany fears UK may quit spy programme because of Brexit Germany fears Britain may pull out of a key intelligence-sharing programme in May next year, a move that it says would create a â€œmoment of weaknessâ€\\x9d in the fight against terrorism and jeopardise security across the EU. As the continent remains on alert for terrorist attacks, Berlin is understood to view intelligence as Britainâ€™s primary contribution to European collaboration, and fears it could use future cooperation as a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations. According to documents seen by the , Germany is already lobbying the British government to renew its role in Europeâ€™s law enforcement agency, Europol, before its current collaboration runs out on 1 May 2017. In a response to a parliamentary question submitted by Germanyâ€™s Left party, Angela Merkelâ€™s government confirmed that it believed the European commission should encourage the UK to remain in Europol. Doing so was in Britainâ€™s interest, the document produced by the German interior ministry said, because â€œcollaborating and sharing information via Europol can help the UK prevent and fight terrorism and serious crimeâ€\\x9d. After a series of attempted terrorist attacks over the summer and a politically charged debate about the risks of Merkelâ€™s stance during the refugee crisis, German politicians in particular are concerned that Britain could use its large intelligence capacities as a bargaining chip. â€œRecent attacks and arrests of suspected terrorists have shown that a close collaboration between international security agencies is indispensable,â€\\x9d said Stephan Mayer, the interior policy spokesperson of Merkelâ€™s CDU/CSU party group. â€œEven after a possible Brexit, the fight against terrorism will remain an enormous challenge for European states; and this naturally applies to Europolâ€™s work too. â€œAll those responsible have to guarantee that this cooperation continues successfully and without friction in spite of a Brexit. The international fight against Islamic extremism and terrorism cannot afford a moment of weakness.â€\\x9d European governments and Brussels officials have been emphasising in public that there can be no pre-negotiations with Britain, however informal, until May officially informs the EU of its intention to leave by triggering article 50. Before Octoberâ€™s European council meeting in Brussels, German government officials vehemently denied that security cooperation would form part of the discussions at the summit. But the EUâ€™s united front has been undermined by some inconvenient timetabling. On 1 May 2017, a month after the deadline May has given herself for triggering article 50, the European Union will adopt a regulation that expands the role of the European parliament and national EU legislatures in supervising Europolâ€™s operations. On Friday, May told EU officials that she would stick to her deadline in spite of the high courtâ€™s decision that her government must get parliamentary approval to trigger article 50. Some MPs have suggested the need to draft new legislation may further squeeze the planned timetable. The UK is not part of the border-free Schengen zone and has an opt-in into Europol, which will automatically expire as soon as the new rules come into effect. By dropping out of Europol, the UK would automatically be shut out of a number of other agencies and intelligence cooperation programmes, such as the Schengen-wide information system SIS II. A Home Office spokesman pointed to recent comments made by Brandon Lewis, the policing minister, who said no decision had yet been taken on Europol. â€œThe decision on whether we opt into the further Europol regulations will be announced to parliament shortly. We will take that decision very soon; we are giving good consideration to where we are on that and will make an announcement to parliament in due course,â€\\x9d he said. Last week Lewis confirmed in a letter that the UK would press ahead with an opt-in to the PrÃ¼m convention, an EU-wide system for sharing DNA samples, fingerprints and vehicle registration. A report (pdf) by the German parliamentâ€™s academic service recently raised alarm over the hole that Brexit could leave in Europeâ€™s security network, and pointed out that the UK would no longer have direct access to Europolâ€™s databases. Europol, which is based in The Hague, started operations in 1999 and is funded through the EU budget. It has a British director, Rob Wainwright, and according to a spokesperson, 40% of its cases have a â€œBritish dimensionâ€\\x9d. German government officials told the that there was still hope in Berlin that as a former home secretary, May would appreciate the value of cooperating on counter-terrorism measures. In a private speech at Goldman Sachs before the EU referendum, recently leaked to the , May expressly argued that British security was best served by remaining in Europe. The German Left party MP Andrej Hunko, who submitted the query to the government, said that although the UK had been one of the main drivers behind Europolâ€™s engagement in covert intelligence networking, Britain opting out of the agency could potentially give rise to even more informal and less democratically accountable forms of information-sharing. â€œAfter Brexit, the strengthening of informal structures such as the police working group on terrorism and the Club de Berne could become a major cause for concernâ€\\x9d, Hunko said. â€œThese institutions donâ€™t form part of the European Union and are thus harder to control by either delegates in the European parliament or our national parliaments, with national governments remaining as secretive about such networks as they can.â€\\x9d From the position of the German Left party, Hunko said, â€œthe question of whether British police should remain part of Europol is therefore a choice between the devil and the deep blue seaâ€\\x9d.',\n",
              "  'No global economic crisis yet, but the ingredients are there Another day, another financial spasm. In London, New York, Shanghai and Frankfurt the story was the same: shares dumped and the oil price crashing to its lowest level since 2003 on fears that China is heading into a recession that will drag the rest of the world economy down with it. Despite the fresh sell-off in financial markets on Wednesday, this is far from a done deal. For the doomsday scenario to materialise, China would need to have a hard landing, rather than simply a bumpy one, the rest of the world would have to be ripe for its own crisis, and there would need to be a transmission mechanism for delivering a problem centred on east Asia to the rest of the global economy. For the time being, the theory that the events of the past three weeks herald another 2008-style crisis is just that: a hypothesis. But make no mistake, if the conditions for a recession are right, it would move around the world like a pandemic. That, after all, is the essence of globalisation. Economies are far more integrated than they were half a century ago, when capital controls, trade barriers and extensive public ownership shielded national economies. Today, changes in political philosophy and technology mean there are far fewer impediments to the free movement of goods â€“ and virtually none at all to the free movement of money. So, when one country runs into problems there is always the risk of contagion. That was true of Thailand in 1997, when the collapse of its currency, the baht, quickly had a domino effect across south-east Asia. It was true also of what appeared to be a local difficulty in a much bigger economy. Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the US Federal Reserve, was dismissive in 2006 of the notion that problems with sub-prime mortgages posed a threat to the American, let alone the global, economy. How wrong he was. Britainâ€™s direct exposure to China is relatively modest. It is not in the top five overseas markets for UK companies, and only 4% of UK goods and services go there. If Chinaâ€™s economy hits the wall, some jobs would be at risk but it would not be nearly as serious as a recession in the United States or the eurozone. The US has more at stake, but even so exports to China account for only 1% of GDP. Britainâ€™s banks are, however, a different story. UK banks â€“ HSBC and Standard Chartered in particular â€“ have lent lots of money to China to the extent that they have more at risk than any other country, should the loans turn sour. China has a mountain of bad debts. So how would the crisis manifest itself? One way, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at analysts IHS, would be if China stopped trying to support its currency, the yuan. The result, he says, would be a devaluation of 15-20% that would make Chinaâ€™s exports cheaper but those of every other country more expensive. This would be the opening salvo in a full-blown currency war. Other countries would retaliate and the US would impose trade sanctions on Chinese goods. Deflationary pressure would intensify as Asian countries dumped their excess production on the rest of the world. The UK steel industry has already had a taste of this. China is producing more steel than it needs for its own economic growth and is selling it at cut-price rates. British producers have found it impossible to compete. That, though, would only be the start of the mayhem. Many countries in the emerging world have borrowed heavily in dollars. China itself has $1tn of dollar-denominated debt. If the yuan and other emerging market currencies are devalued, then the value of these dollar debts will rise, putting severe strain on all the affected economies and unbearable strain on the most vulnerable. Zhu Min, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, sketched out in Davos on Wednesday what would happen next. Quite simply, every investor would stampede for the exit at the same time. Liquidity in the global economy would dry up, he said, noting: â€œThat scares everybody.â€\\x9d It certainly does. Around the concrete bunker hosting the World Economic Forum, the masters of the universe were quietly checking the latest from the financial markets on their smartphones and tablets. A few eyebrows were raised when the Dowâ€™s fall reached 500 points. Chief executives of multinational corporations should not, of course, need to be reminded of global interconnectedness. If they did, Nobel prize-winning scientists were on hand in Davos for a tutorial on chaos theory. One of its ideas is that seemingly tiny events can have big impacts, so that a beating of a butterflyâ€™s wing could lead to a hurricane on the other side of the world. China is a very big butterfly.',\n",
              "  'Pornhub launches explicit audio for the visually impaired For the around 285 million people worldwide who are visually impaired, pornography can seem like an acoustic blur of heavy breathing, squelches, slaps and Maria Sharapova-esque grunts. To help them find some sexual inspiration, the video-sharing site Pornhub has launched a â€œdescribed videoâ€\\x9d category, in which professional voice actors explain whatâ€™s going on in the scene. The section has launched with a collection of 50 of the siteâ€™s most popular videos, and thereâ€™s something for everyone: straight, gay, female friendly, bi and transexual. Pornhub launched in 2007, and claims 60 million daily views to its professional and amateur adult content. The new narrated videos include descriptions of the settings, models, what they are wearing and the positions they are getting into, combined with the original audio of the video. Many of the explicitly titled clips have already attracted more than 20,000 views. The accessibility initiative is being championed by the adult entertainment companyâ€™s philanthropic division (yes, really), Pornhub Cares, which has previously launched a clothing line to fight against domestic violence and a breast cancer awareness campaign called â€œSave the Boobsâ€\\x9d, where it donated 1 cent for every 30 videos viewed within its â€œbig titâ€\\x9d and â€œsmall titâ€\\x9d categories. â€œItâ€™s our goal to service all of our usersâ€™ needs, which begins with making content accessible to every individual,â€\\x9d said Pornhub vice-president Corey Price. â€œWe selected some of the videos that were better suited for narration and could be best described in detail. We wanted to describe all that we could to provide the user with the best possible experience while not taking away from the videoâ€™s original audio.â€\\x9d Price added that Pornhub wants to encourage its users to create and upload more audio descriptive clips with the differently abled in mind. â€œPeople who are blind have every right to access porn as they do classical Shakespeare or any other kind of video,â€\\x9d says Joel Snyder, director of the audio description project at the American Council of the Blind. Snyder welcomes Pornhubâ€™s efforts to make its content more accessible, but suggests the move isnâ€™t entirely altruistic. â€œThere are more than 21 million people in this country who are either blind or have trouble seeing even with eye correction. The community is large and has buying power, so this smacks of something that just economically makes good sense.â€\\x9d Pornhub isnâ€™t the first organization to make porn accessible for the visually impaired. Back in 2006, a website called Pornfortheblind.org recruited volunteers to record graphic descriptions of popular adult videos, which were uploaded as MP3 files. The site became a cult hit, attracting as many as 150,000 visitors per month. Offline, an artist called Lisa Murphy has created a book of tactile photographs of nudes, embossed on white plastic pages along with a braille description.',\n",
              "  \"Cult heroes: Betty Wright â€“ soul's golden agony aunt Betty Wright was a little late for the 60s heyday of Motown, Stax and Atlantic, but she wasted no time catching up. Her first album was released in 1968, when she was only 14; she had her first pop hit when she was 17; she earned her first gold record when she was barely 18 â€“ all despite coming from a religious family that refused to allow anything other than gospel to be played at home. Looking back on her childhood in an interview in 2012, she said she managed to persuade her mother to bless her nascent pop career by also being an A student who â€œdid all the right things in schoolâ€\\x9d, as if being musically precocious wasnâ€™t enough of an achievement. In those early records, thereâ€™s an amusing disjunction between Wright the youthful singer and the put-upon female characters she portrays. In Babysitter â€“ one of the first songs she wrote herself â€“ a woebegone mother warns women not to trust any â€œ16-year-old schoolgirlâ€\\x9d around their husbands, and it sounds perfectly reasonable until you remember that Wright herself was still in her teens. She is the queen of the cautionary tale and practically an agony aunt when it comes to dispensing relationship advice, but she should be approached with caution unless you want a scolding administered along with tissues and gin. Secretary is clear on whose fault it is if a man has a work affair: the secretary â€œtakes the time to listen / To what he has to say / While all you do is nag him / A thousand times a day.â€\\x9d In the entry on Wright in the Rough Guide to Soul and R&B, Peter Shapiro expresses reservations about Wrightâ€™s first hit, Girls Canâ€™t Do What the Guys Do: for him itâ€™s â€œa strange record given Wrightâ€™s assertive catalogue, and it sounded as though she was fighting with the chauvinistic lyricsâ€\\x9d. And yet the line she takes â€“ that girls canâ€™t sleep around, or attempt to revenge a boyfriendâ€™s misdemeanours, â€œand still be a ladyâ€\\x9d â€“ is of a piece with so many of the songs in her catalogue. In the late 80s she released the â€œPain trilogyâ€\\x9d, a sequence of songs reflecting on the ups and downs of a long relationship, which have a similar core of conservatism. In No Pain (No Gain), for instance, she explains â€œsomething you young girls might not understandâ€\\x9d â€“ that love requires work, commitment and forgiveness, and â€œa little bit of pleasureâ€™s worth a whole lot of painâ€\\x9d. Even when she bosses men around, she does so with solicitude for them and an eye on womenâ€™s responsibility: in Love Donâ€™t Grow on a Love Tree, from her brilliant 1974 album Danger High Voltage (such a perfect title), she tells a two-timing man that he canâ€™t have â€œevery woman you seeâ€\\x9d â€“ but canâ€™t help herself hoping â€œyou get just what you needâ€\\x9d. And on her 2011 comeback album The Movie, in a duet with Snoop Dogg called Real Woman, she instructed all the young men in her life: â€œGet yourself a real womanâ€\\x9d â€“ no gold-diggers, basically; women willing to do the work/commitment/forgiveness thing â€“ â€œso you can be a real manâ€\\x9d. There are a lot of young men â€“ and women â€“ in Wrightâ€™s life because, as she told the online magazine Soul and Jazz and Funk, sheâ€™s the â€œmamma-sister-auntie-cousin type of womanâ€\\x9d. Instead of a â€œdiva typeâ€\\x9d driven by the desire for fame and awards, her energies are focused on supporting other singers and musicians. Joss Stone â€“ another absurdly precocious teen star â€“ is one of her most high-profile mentees, and Wright was nominated for a Grammy for her co-production work on Stoneâ€™s 2004 album Mind, Body and Soul. But there are plenty of others, and even a â€œsongwriting campâ€\\x9d Wright set up called the Most, abbreviated from Mountain of Songs Today (equals Mountain of Songs Tomorrow). â€œI want to inspire people to write,â€\\x9d she told her local newspaper, the Miami New Times, in 2012: write, that is, as opposed to sample, a practice that receives seriously short shrift in the opening track from The Movie, Old Songs. â€œWhat you gonna listen to,â€\\x9d she demands, â€œif you ainâ€™t making nothing new?â€\\x9d A diligent businesswoman, Wright has taken people to court for not paying royalties when they sampled her records, and in 1985, noticing that men in the music industry tended to be paid more readily than she did, set up her own record label to ensure she would never have to fight for what she had earned. Three years later, she used it to release her album Mother Wit, winning a gold record in the process. Mother Wit opens with two of the Pain songs, but maybe a better signature tune is Ms Time: â€œI wait on no man,â€\\x9d Wright shrieks with relish, â€œyou wish that I stand still for you.â€\\x9d Across her career what you hear is a mixture of take-no-crap assertiveness and hard-won acceptance, belligerent attitude and genuine kindness. In an interview from 2012 with Blues & Soul magazine, she talked of how important it is that music â€œhelps you get from Monday to Tuesdayâ€\\x9d and gives its listeners hope. She focuses on romance, she said, to communicate the message that â€œno matter how bad the economy gets, as long as I have you here we can live in a tree! You know we can go out and bathe in the lake if we have to, but if you are with me and I am with you, we can do this. I think those are songs that people need to hear now,â€\\x9d and sheâ€™s right, we do.\",\n",
              "  'Vote that could make Andrea Leadsom a Tory outlier â€“ like Corbyn It is beginning to dawn that in the wake of the Brexit vote there will be no such thing as a return to business as usual in British politics. But thatâ€™s not just because a prime minister has resigned, important though that is. Much more, it is because the full shock waves of the Brexit win have barely started to be felt. We wonâ€™t see the same kind of drama this week that we saw two weeks ago when David Cameron quit after the referendum vote, or last week when Michael Gove turned against Boris Johnson in the fight to be Cameronâ€™s successor. But the dynamics of the Conservative leadership race are not settled yet. Theresa May enters the week of the first ballot in a commanding position to win first place in the contest among MPs. But the home Â\\xadsecretaryâ€™s camp made clear over the weekend that she does not want a so-called coronation, as happened when Michael Howard succeeded Iain Duncan Smith unopposed in 2003. She is right to prefer a contest because a coronation would look like a stitch-up. May backed remain in the referendum, albeit without any evident enthusiasm. She has gone into this contest, as she intended she would, as a Eurosceptic remainer, hoping that this will allow her to gather up votes from both wings of the party and succeed as a unity candidate. So far it looks like a winning strategy. But a coronation would leave the Brexiters feeling betrayed, so May has to favour a full contest. Such a contest is fraught with uncertainties. Fundamentally that is because the Conservative partyâ€™s membership, said to be about 150,000, will make the final decision between the two candidates left standing after the MPsâ€™ ballot. But it is also because a two-horse race gives the second-placed candidate a huge chance to gather up the support of all those who have doubts about the frontrunner. The party has form on this, and it is form that will give May the shivers. In 2001, the largely anti-European membership handed the prize to Duncan Smith rather than the frontrunner and ardent pro-European Kenneth Clarke. Even though May is not nearly as outspoken a pro-European as Clarke, she is vulnerable to the view among Brexiters that the crown should go to one of their own. The crown this time, of course, is not the leadership of the opposition, as it was in 2001 when IDS was elected. It is the prime ministership itself. That could mean that the party members â€“ who are not the same people as they were in 2001 anyway â€“ are more cautious than they were 15 years ago, because they know the decision has national consequences. But it could equally mean that they decide it is vital to seize their chance and put a Brexiter into No 10. As things stand, that candidate looks like Andrea Leadsom, the business minister, who has never sat at the cabinet table. Leadsom is not in fact an out-and-out anti-European. As she said in 2013, in words that have suddenly become famous: â€œI donâ€™t think the UK should leave the EU. I think it would be a disaster for our economy and it would lead to a decade of economic and political uncertainty at a time when the tectonic plates of global success are moving.â€\\x9d I can personally confirm from listening to her at about the same time that Leadsom was not in favour of leaving. But if she can shake that embarrassment off her back she has a real chance of galvanising the Tory membership and overtaking May on the line. If that happened, not only would Leadsom become the first British prime minister in history elected by a party membership (as May would too, of course), but British politics would also be in uncharted waters for parliamentary democracy as a whole. Both the main parties, Labour and the Tories, would be led by people who would have been imposed on the partyâ€™s MPs against their will, or at least against their better judgment. And that would be only the start. The leadership election will decide who speaks for Britain. But it wonâ€™t decide what Britain should say about its relationship with Europe. No one yet has a clue about that. Business as usual remains a very distant dream.',\n",
              "  'How a Hollywood film reveals the reality of drone warfare G avin Hoodâ€™s film Eye in the Sky is a thrillingly intelligent exploration of the political and ethical questions surrounding drone warfare. It has been carefully researched and is on the cutting edge of what is currently possible. (Full disclosure: I offered the screenwriter early advice.) But thereâ€™s a longer history and a wider geography that casts those issues in a different light. As soon as the Wright brothers demonstrated the possibility of human flight, others were busy imagining flying machines with nobody on board. In 1910 the engineer Raymond Phillips captivated crowds in the London Hippodrome with a remotely controlled airship that floated out over the stalls and, when he pressed a switch, released hundreds of paper birds on to the heads of the audience below. When he built the real thing, he promised, the birds would be replaced with bombs. Sitting safely in London he could attack Paris or Berlin.  There has always been something hideously theatrical about bombing â€“ recall the shock and awe visited on the inhabitants of Baghdad in 2003. The spectacle now includes the marionette movements of drones, Predators and Reapers whose electronic strings are pulled from thousands of miles away. Remoteness, however, is an elastic measure. Human beings have been killing others at ever greater distances since the invention of the dart, the spear and the slingshot. The invention of firearms wrought another transformation in the range of military violence. And yet today, in a world shrunk by the very technologies that have made the deployment of armed drones possible, the use of these remote platforms seems to turn distance back into a moral absolute. But if it is wrong to kill someone from 7,500 miles away (the distance from Creech air force base in Nevada to Afghanistan), over what distance is it permissible to kill somebody? For some, the difference is that drone crews are safe in the continental United States â€“ their lives are not on the line â€“ and this has become a constant refrain in the drone debates. In fact, the US Air Force has been concerned about the safety of its aircrews ever since its high losses during the second world war. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it experimented with remotely controlled B-17 and B-47 aircraft to drop nuclear bombs without exposing aircrews to danger from the blast, and today it lauds its Predators and Reapers for their ability to â€œproject power without vulnerabilityâ€\\x9d. Itâ€™s a complicated boast, because these remote platforms are slow, sluggish and easy to shoot down. They can only be used in uncontested air space against people who canâ€™t fight back. There are almost 200 people involved in every combat air patrol and most of them are indeed out of harmâ€™s way. But in Afghanistan the launch and recovery and the maintenance crews â€“ Predators and Reapers have a short range, so that they have to be launched by crews close to their targets â€“ are exposed to real danger. Bombing in the major wars of the 20th century was always dangerous to those who carried it out, but those who dropped bombs over Hamburg or Cologne in the second world war or Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s were, in a crucial sense, also remote from their targets. â€œThe good thing about being in an aeroplane at war is that you never touch the enemyâ€\\x9d, recalled one veteran of Bomber Command. â€œYou never see the whites of their eyes.â€\\x9d Distance no longer confers blindness on those who operate todayâ€™s drones. They have a much closer, more detailed view of the people they kill. The US Air Force describes their job as putting â€œwarheads on foreheadsâ€\\x9d, and they are required to remain on station to carry out a battle damage assessment that is often an inventory of body parts.  Most drone crews will tell you that they do not feel thousands of miles away from the action: just 18 inches, the distance from eye to screen. Their primary function is to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Although drones have been armed since 2001, until 2012 they were directly responsible for only 5 to 10% of air strikes in Afghanistan. But they were involved in orchestrating more. Flying a Predator or a Reaper â€œis more like being a managerâ€\\x9d, one pilot has explained. â€œYouâ€™re managing multiple assets and youâ€™re involved with the other platforms using the information coming off of your aircraft.â€\\x9d In principle itâ€™s not so different from using aircraft to range targets for artillery on the Western Front, but the process has been radicalised by the droneâ€™s real-time full-motion video feeds that enable highly mobile â€œtargets of opportunityâ€\\x9d to be identified and tracked. In the absence of ground intelligence, this becomes crucial: until drones were relocated in sufficient numbers from Afghanistan and elsewhere to enable purported IS-targets in Syria to be identified, most US aircraft were returning to base without releasing their weapons. Armed drones are used to carry out targeted killings, both inside and outside areas of â€œactive hostilitiesâ€\\x9d, and to provide close air support to ground troops. Targeted killing has spurred an intense critical debate, and rightly so â€“ this is the focus of Eye in the Sky too â€“ but close air support has not been subject to the same scrutiny. In both cases, video feeds are central, but it is a mistake to think that this reduces war to a video game â€“ a jibe that in any case fails to appreciate that todayâ€™s video games are often profoundly immersive. In fact, that may be part of the problem. Several studies have shown that civilian casualties are most likely when air strikes are carried out to support troops in contact with an enemy, and even more likely when they are carried out from remote platforms. I suspect that drone crews may compensate for their physical rather than emotional distance by â€œleaning forwardâ€\\x9d to do everything they can to protect the troops on the ground. This in turn predisposes them to interpret every action in the vicinity of a ground force as hostile â€“ and civilians as combatants â€“ not least because these are silent movies: the only sound, apart from the clacking of computer keys as they talk in secure chatrooms with those watching the video feeds, comes from radio communications with their own forces. In contrast to those shown in Eye in the Sky, those feeds are often blurry, fuzzy, indistinct, broken, compressed â€“ and, above all, ambiguous. How can you be sure that is an insurgent burying an IED and not a farmer digging a ditch? The situation is more fraught because the image stream is watched by so many other eyes on the ground, who all have their own ideas about what is being shown and what to do about it. Combining sensor and shooter in the same (remote) platform may have â€œcompressed the kill-chainâ€\\x9d, as the air force puts it, and this is vital in an era of â€œjust in timeâ€\\x9d, liquid war where everything happens so fast. Yet in another sense the kill-chain has been spectacularly extended: senior officers, ground force commanders, military lawyers and video analysts all have access to the feeds. Thereâ€™s a wonderful passage in Brian Castnerâ€™s book All the Ways we Kill and Die that captures the dilemma perfectly. â€œA human in the loop?â€\\x9d Castnerâ€™s drone pilot complains. â€œTry two or three or 100 humans in the loop. Gene was the eye of the needle, and the whole war and a thousand rich generals must pass through him ... If they wanted to fly the fucking plane, they could come out and do it themselves.â€\\x9d This is the networked warfare, scattered over multiple locations around the world, shown in Eye in the Sky. But the network often goes down and gets overloaded â€“ itâ€™s not a smooth and seamlessly functioning machine â€“ and it is shot through with ambiguity, uncertainty and indecision. And often those eyes in the sky multiply, rather than disperse, the fogs of war. Derek Gregory is the Peter Wall Distinguished Professor at the University of British Columbia.

              "  'Georginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham Oh what might have been. On an afternoon when Tynesiders devoted virtually the entire 90 minutes to imploring Rafa BenÃ\\xadtez to stay on as Newcastle Unitedâ€™s manager next season his previously underachieving team belatedly remembered they could actually play a bit. In the process Aleksandar Mitrovic created one goal, scored another and was sent off for a truly appalling challenge as Tottenham Hotspurâ€™s chances of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1995 were shredded. Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s players needed only a point to finish second but ended up third and looking anything but a team capable of competing in next seasonâ€™s Champions League. Any Championship managers watching this will most definitely not be looking forward to next seasonâ€™s meetings with Newcastle, which rather begs the question: how on earth did it come this? While BenÃ\\xadtezâ€™s players shrugged off the inhibitions imposed by fear of relegation, Tottenhamâ€™s shockingly abject performance emphasised their failure to recover from the blow of losing out to Leicester in the title race. At other times, on other days, St Jamesâ€™ Park might have staged protests against their watching owner, Mike Ashley; instead Newcastle were politely applauded on to the field before kick-off. If part of that was probably about old habits dying hard, a bigger reason was the â€œKeep Rafaâ€\\x9d agenda. It meant that, rather indulging in â€œsack the boardâ€\\x9d chants, home fans held up placards proclaiming: â€œRafa the Gaffa. Please stay. The Toon need you.â€\\x9d Such messages were backed up an incessant two-word soundtrack set to the tune of La Bamba. â€œRafa BenÃ\\xadtez, Rafa BenÃ\\xadtez,â€\\x9d fans chorused, with the volume being raised appreciably once Gini Wijnaldum gave them lead. Spurs had begun in unusually jaded fashion with Toby Alderweireld fluffing an attempted clearance and the ball falling to Moussa Sissoko who played in Mitrovic. The Serbia strikerâ€™s deft lay-off found Wijnaldum who shot low into the bottom corner from 12 yards. It was the Dutchmanâ€™s 10th goal of a season he had started so brightly before sinking into a prolonged midwinter slump. Fortunately for Wijnaldum, the crowd were clearly in a forgiving mood and the Gallowgate End briefly celebrated with a few blasts of â€œStand up if you love the Toon,â€\\x9d before reverting to their previous refrain. Their spirit was barely dampened by the sight of a small aeroplane circling the skies above them trailing a large banner bearing the message: â€œAuf Weidersehen Prem: Tyne to go.â€\\x9d It offered proof that some people really do have more money than sense â€“ there are surely much better ways to spend the best part of Â£1,000. As if determined to defy that mocking eye in the sky Newcastle swiftly scored a second. Sissoko delivered a fabulous cross from the right and, having beaten both Alderweireld and Kyle Walker to the ball, Mitrovic evaded Hugo Llorisâ€™s reach with an imperious header. Loud as the resultant applause was it seemed bitter-sweet, underscored by a certain sadness. Spurs, meanwhile, had created a solitary first-half chance which featured Karl Darlow doing well to block Christian Eriksenâ€™s fierce shot. As the half wore on, the prospect of second spot and putting Arsenal in their place receded ever faster for Tottenham. Admittedly they reduced the deficit but the consequences stemming from the moment Harry Kane and Eric Dier combined to free Ã‰rik Lamela down the left were destined to serve as the most academic of footnotes. Initially it looked as if Lamela would cross but instead, from a seemingly impossible angle, he unleashed a shot which beat Darlow at his near post, the ball deflecting off the keeper and into the roof of the net. If Darlow appeared less than delighted about that concession, Mitrovic should have been disgusted with himself for an appallingly reckless high, over the top, challenge which caught Walker on the shin and could easily have resulted a broken leg for Englandâ€™s right back. Mitrovic even tried to contest the inevitable red card before being ushered off by Sissoko. This being a perverse sort of afternoon 10-man Newcastleâ€™s reaction was merely to extend their lead. When Sissokoâ€™s long legs took him into the penalty area he collapsed dramatically after Eriksenâ€™s perceived interception and Wijnaldum sent Lloris the wrong way from the spot. Buoyed by that rather generously awarded penalty, Andros Townsend hit a post, Daryl Janmaat crossed and Rolando Aarons half-volleyed a brilliant goal. Turning creator, Aaronsâ€™s pass then picked out the overlapping Janmaat whose low shot defied Lloris. St Jamesâ€™ Park reverberated to a by now familiar theme. â€œWe want you to stay,â€\\x9d they roared. â€œRafa BenÃ\\xadtez, we want you to stay.â€\\x9d Man of the match Gini Wijnaldum (Newcastle United)',\n",
              "  'Struggling to understand killers After last weekâ€™s wave of tragic attacks in Germany, Boris Johnson was criticised for publicly speculating that Islamist extremism was behind the shooting in Munich. While our new foreign secretaryâ€™s comments may have been inappropriate - and wrong - his brain, like most peopleâ€™s, was subject to an overwhelming impulse to find a possible motivation for an action as soon as it occurs. Our desire to understand the motivations of a killer involves a particular part of the brain called the â€˜temporo-parietal junctionâ€™. Also known as the â€˜mindreadingâ€™ area of the brain, it automatically ascribes possible incentives, beliefs and desires to others. This reflex developed to help us socialise, but is so powerful that we also apply it to inanimate objects such as computers, shouting, â€˜Why are you doing this to me?â€™ as they crash yet again. Even a pair of triangles can appear to exhibit personal motivations, as proved by a psychological test called the Heider-Simmel animation. However, while Borisâ€™s brain is partly to blame for his speculations, unfortunately it couldnâ€™t help him keep them to himself.

              "  '_9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9: the mysterious tale terrifying Reddit If you take enough LSD, can you build a portal to the divine? It sounds like a typical internet conspiracy theory, the kind of thing weirdos post in online communities isolated from the rest of the world. But itâ€™s also a conceptual prompt for a new work of digital fiction â€“ a cool, and deeply creepy story that is gaining a cult fanbase. Two weeks ago, a user who came to be known as â€œ_9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9â€\\x9d posted a disjointed snippet of text in a comment on Reddit, a site where communities post articles, images, personal stories and more for threaded group discussions. The post, added almost as if by accident to a thread about the cover of George Orwellâ€™s 1984, made claims about the CIAâ€™s acid-fuelled â€œmind control experimentâ€\\x9d programme, Project MKUltra, a common staple of paranoid theory. MKUltra was indeed a real programme, but other items the user mentioned â€“ â€œrestraint bed portalsâ€\\x9d and â€œflesh interfacesâ€\\x9d â€“ are not. The user continued to post about topics including Vietnam, Elizabeth Bathory, the Treblinka concentration camp, humpback whales, the Manson Family and LSD, but especially about the inexplicable â€œflesh interfacesâ€\\x9d, being built somehow by shadowy programmes. A Reddit user might chance upon a single one of these posts in one of their ordinary discussion threads, but clicking on the username of _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 would let you view all their posts in aggregate, and there, a compelling science-fiction horror story was beginning to emerge, gradually more beautifully and boldly written from multiple narrative perspectives, but with a common mystery. Reddit makes a fascinating platform for community-oriented fiction, and a perfect one for this slow-building and creepy invention, which fans have started calling â€œThe Interface Seriesâ€\\x9d. Each snippet of the abstract tale lives in a different discussion thread, so reading feels like combing a conversation history rather than following a linear tale. You can read the story in chronological order, but you can also follow the mystery to its origin: the standard display format for a userâ€™s comments on Reddit is in reverse chronological order. By sorting the posts according to how â€œhotâ€\\x9d or â€œcontroversialâ€\\x9d they are, you can let the engagement of other readers guide your experience. Eerie fragments The seemingly random thread names start to form a pattern: the reader gets the distinct pleasure of wondering why the author chose to post each component in each place. Eerie fragments of fiction hide among commonplace online discussion. Sometimes readers reply and engage, and sometimes are none the wiser. The enthusiastic cult fandom quickly built a Wiki to study and catalogue the mysterious tale, create a timeline of known events, and to note in a sort of literary formalist way what tropes the author is employing. The story also has its own dedicated discussion thread where volunteers have even developed audiobook editions. The internet has always loved a good mystery, and Wikis, message boards and image boards have a history of playing host to fascinating and often scary folktales that leverage the format and utility of these digital spaces in creative ways. In recent history, as the internet gradually grew from a niche hideaway for young weirdos to an omnipresent and pragmatic component of daily life, these subversive posts, videos and stories emerged organically and often anonymously as if to will online space to remain surprising, unsettling and subversive. The first subject to come back encased was an 8-year-old girl we had named Jingles. We started naming the kids dogsâ€™ names to try to depersonalize them, to assuage the guilt. This was done by the recommendation of CIA psychiatrists, but it didnâ€™t work very well. â€œCreepypastaâ€\\x9d is one name for scary text found in commonplace online communities, and users often borrow, reproduce and add to these texts to create a sort of fictive group collage (â€œpastaâ€\\x9d is derived from the command â€œpasteâ€\\x9d). The popular culture character of â€œSlender Manâ€\\x9d originated in the internet meme community and became a household name â€“ and, allegedly, led two 12 year-old girls to commit a stabbing. â€œThe Holdersâ€\\x9d is a crowdsourced series related to the end of the world; its format dictates that benign instructions lead to horrific, reality-warping objects and situations. â€œThe SCP Foundationâ€\\x9d offers containment procedures for fictional but terrifying phenomena â€“ anyone can contribute to Wiki stories like these, and a group â€œupvotingâ€\\x9d process makes it easy to find the entries that the community thinks are best and most scary. Could the story make contact? Although _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 is apparently only a single author, and the destination and purpose of its tale is unknown (we can only hope itâ€™s not a viral marketing stunt), the writerâ€™s use of Reddit as a storytelling platform means a new kind of format unique to internet fiction, and new opportunities for readers to participate and engage around the work. There is something extra-effective in fiction about the unexpected, the unsettling, the unknown lurking in plain sight within the tools we use for practical dialogue, and this principle has unique implications for horror buffs. When the writer is technically a platform-user just like yourself, thereâ€™s always the lurking possibility they might suddenly notice you, that the story itself could make contact. It was a pit made of flesh. Maybe five feet across and going down about twenty feet before curving out of sight. When I say, â€œmade of flesh,â€\\x9d I mean, it looked like the inside of somebodyâ€™s throat. Wet, reddish flesh-looking stuff. We had heard of them building tunnels, but this was... If youâ€™re not a Reddit user and youâ€™re not sure where to start with the intimidating _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 story, try The Interface Series Wiki, where users have sorted the narrative into an easy-to-read chronological order and have begun building a glossary of terms. Or you can dive directly into the userâ€™s comments and read through them in your own order. Right now there are more than 30 posts, and the nonlinear narrative appears to be shifting from mysterious flesh interfaces and their utterly terrifying â€œincident zonesâ€\\x9d to futuristic â€œhygiene bedsâ€\\x9d for users who are constantly connected to a â€œfeedâ€\\x9d.

              "  'To deliver Brexit, Ukip must rise again So, the politicians have crowned a new prime minister. Theresa May, a remain supporter responsible for the greatest increase in immigration in Britainâ€™s history, may well be popular with a largely Europhile Conservative parliamentary party still struggling to accept its resounding rejection by Conservative voters on 23 June â€“ but she would probably have struggled against the Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom if it had been allowed to go to a membership vote. She is, in a way, a kind of reverse Corbyn: the Labour leader has a huge mandate from the party membership but no mandate among the party elites, while May has a huge mandate from the party elites and no mandate from the party membership. To listen to the media luvvies who have invested a lot of time (and a lot of lunches) in May, her triumph was all about experience. She has been widely lauded as one of Britainâ€™s longest-serving home secretaries â€“ yet very little has been said about the collapse in police morale or the running down of our border force and coastguard in that time. Indeed, the largely positive assessment of Mayâ€™s tenure as home secretary, based on time served rather than track record, speaks volumes about how far the standards we set for those in public life have fallen. But the deed has been done. And without a single vote cast outside the magic circle of Westminster, we have a new premier. This shabby state of affairs, in my view, presents a major opportunity to bring together Nigel Farageâ€™s peopleâ€™s army â€“ those conservatives who actually believe in Britain, and the patriotic working-class voters who rejected the Blairite left on referendum day, united either within Ukip or a new political movement. Fortunately, thanks to the pressure brought to bear on the incoming administration by Leave.EU, the new prime minister has had to give key posts to excellent leave ministers, including David Davis and Liam Fox â€“ talented politicians who, unlike Michael Gove, Dominic Cummings and the rest of the self-regarding Vote Leave cabal, were willing to work with us and with Ukip to achieve a goal bigger than themselves. Even so, news of Mayâ€™s coronation saw Ukipâ€™s membership rocket by over 1,000 in a single day. All over social media, we can see hundreds of Conservatives trading in their blue membership cards for purple ones. Why? Because Britain backed Brexit, and no matter how strenuously the remain campaigners who are responsible for delivering it insist they will respect the vote, leave supporters simply donâ€™t believe them. And this discontent goes beyond Conservative members who are rightly miffed at being stitched up with a remain MP as leader after they voted for Brexit: just look at the shambolic state of the Labour party. First, its working-class voters backed Brexit in a big way. Where do they look for representation now, never mind leadership? Corbyn may have been a reluctant remainer, but â€“ foolishly â€“ he allowed the Blairites to twist his arm for the sake of party unity (for all the good it did him). If he had stuck by his Eurosceptic principles and left the Labour party officially non-aligned, he would have been well placed to take the credit for the Brexit vote and been strengthened against his enemies in the parliamentary party. Instead, heâ€™s ended up in the worst position possible, having backed remain but failed to deliver Labour voters. With some in his party now bleating that the referendum result was â€œadvisory and non-bindingâ€\\x9d and calling for parliament to overturn it, it is more clear than ever to working people that the Labour party is now run by and for a metropolitan elite, and does not speak for them. As for the Liberal Democrats, theyâ€™re now campaigning on a platform of taking Britain back into the EU before weâ€™ve even left it, desperate to regain some relevance by appealing to the spoiled millennials throwing protests outside parliament. So now, more than ever, the country needs Ukip to step up, or for a new movement to step forward. We wonâ€™t achieve anything by tempering ourselves to create another bland, centrist party. We need to lower the barriers to entry for politics, and reach out to new audiences online, as Beppe Grilloâ€™s revolutionary Five Star Movement has done in Italy. Leave.EU has paved the way with its pioneering social media effort, which has over 1 million followers and supporters. The articles and clips we shared alongside our own original content and videos reached a weekly audience of 10 to 15 million, many of whom would never dream of tuning into the Daily Politics or poring over the newspapers. While ignored by the traditional media, which we were bypassing, internal polling suggests that this new way of doing politics made all the difference to the final result on 23 June. We now need to push it further, lowering prices for party membership, putting more control over the party in the hands of the grassroots, and reaching into areas of the country that the mainstream parties have long forgotten or taken for granted. We need to show the public how we, and they, were right to hold their nerve and stick their necks out for Brexit, even with all the combined powers of the political class, media establishment and corporate interests howling against us. More than that, we need to empower people to help shape the new Britain that Brexit has made possible, pushing for a Swiss-style model of direct democracy, which allows citizens to propose their own laws and veto the schemes of the politicians. Britain has its brightest days in front of it, but only if we realise that winning this referendum was not the final hurdle. We have a long way to go before a real Brexit happens, and will have to travel even further before we can realise all the opportunities it allows. Ukip, or a new movement that combines the best in that party with other forces that came together for the referendum, represents our best hope of completing that journey.',\n",
              "  'Opening up scientific publishing for the Flickr generation For an aspiring scientist, being published in a creditable journal is a major step towards gaining respect in the field. But for Mark Hahnel, founder and CEO of Figshare, this old system was drastically in need of an update. â€œThe internet was built for sharing academic data but the way scientific papers are published had hardly changed since the early days of the printing press,â€\\x9d he says. In 2011, Hahnel was studying for a PhD in stem cell biology at Imperial College London, but grew frustrated when it came to getting his work published. In particular, there was no way to publish non-written formats. â€œAll my data was graphs, datasets and video, but when I went to publish this I realised that a lot of publications werenâ€™t set up to handle anything but papers,â€\\x9d he says. â€œI was spending all weekend creating videos and frustrated that I couldnâ€™t publish them.â€\\x9d Hahnel saw an opportunity to both help aspiring scientists and improve the quality of debate in science. Using Wordpress and â€œsome basic Pythonâ€\\x9d [computer code] he set up Figshare â€“ initially to publish his own work. But he soon found there were others in the scientific community who saw it as advantageous. â€œAcademia is very cut-throat. People need to get published and receive citations in order to get jobs and funding,â€\\x9d he says. â€œBut also I think a lot of younger students get it, as theyâ€™ve grown up with the internet and think things should be open and collaborative.â€\\x9d His activities caught the attention of the technology investor and incubator Digital Science, which backed Hahnel to further develop his platform. â€œI handed in my PhD on the Friday and moved into new offices on Monday,â€\\x9d says Hahnel Hahnel admits that in the early days he â€œdidnâ€™t have a clueâ€\\x9d about business and had to learn a lot. â€œIâ€™d never done business studies, but we were able to learn about business and how to market the company. Digital Science helped me with the startup process; everything from establishing a sustainability model to marketing and understanding what an EBITDA is,â€\\x9d he says. â€œWe brought in some developers and relaunched Figshare in January 2012. Weâ€™ve created a place where anyone can publish and view the content for free.â€\\x9d Hahnel says he was inspired by sites such as Github and Flickr and wanted to create something comparable for research science. However, there have been some technical hurdles to overcome. For instance, academic papers require footnotes that link to other sources, but this can be difficult to do online as URLs are often reorganised and this can lead to broken links. The developers at Figshare created Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) that find the new address of a page if it is moved. Ultimately, the business aimed to create an infrastructure that was designed to last and to be user-friendly. â€œThe process of building scalable infrastructure as a priority over cool new features is something that we set up early, and it is really helping us now,â€\\x9d Hahnel adds. But the most important aspect of Figshare is that it has created a model that disrupts the current method, where universities pay publishers to see the work that they have created. According to STM, the trade association for academic and professional publishers, its membersâ€™ revenues are worth roughly $10bn (Â£7bn) annually and the industry employs more than 100,000 people worldwide. And although well known journals such as Nature, Science and Cell are much sought after, there are more than 28,000 English-language science publications to choose from. â€œIâ€™ve published three papers but I donâ€™t have access to them because Iâ€™m not a university,â€\\x9d Hahnel says. â€œThe top ten publishers were paid over Â£430m by universities between 2010-14 so that they could access their own content.â€\\x9d Figshare has two revenue streams: it provides universities with the means to publish online â€“ universities are given mini Figshares which let students self-publish â€“ and it provides cloud solutions for publishers to host and publish data. Figshare has now published 2.5m objects (papers, datasets and videos) and provides several institutions with its services including the University of Sheffield, The Royal Society, Wiley and University of Auckland. But not everyone in academia is impressed. Hahnel says younger scientists and tenured professors are positive about Figshare, but those less secure in their work are more wary. â€œThe people who were taught to publish or perish and donâ€™t want people to see their data because they will find their mistakes are worried by it,â€\\x9d he says. â€œThatâ€™s the insanity of academia, that people in a self-correcting science might be concerned that someone will find an error.â€\\x9d But having an open platform means that the strength of the content is dependent on those publishing it. Currently, files are checked by a team of 30 people to ensure they are of academic standard but the business is developing ways to enable its users to curate content. â€œWe would like to start curating all of this information in a crowdsourced manner. Instead of using traditional peer review â€“ which may be difficult for a 10-second video â€“ weâ€™ll be looking at automating levels of curation and measuring global attention around objects.â€\\x9d Hahnel adds that journals donâ€™t have to follow the peer review model, citing the physics, maths and computer science archive, arXiv.org, as one example. He also says that science can only be checked and corrected if the datasets are open. Hahnel is now focusing on spreading the word and meeting with universities â€“ including American institutions â€“ to make it the place to go to publish research. But the big aim is to create a portal that can truly advance science. In the online age, where inaccurate news can spread fast, a definitive, rational and instantly accessible voice is needed, Hahnel suggests. â€œWe hope to help build a future where everyone can ask questions and back up their answers with data, whether it is inaccurate reports linking autism to vaccines in mainstream news, or much larger questions such as the origins of the universe and how to treat diseases,â€\\x9d he says. â€œBy making all of this information openly available to all in a manner that humans and machines can interpret, we can advance human knowledge a lot further, faster.â€\\x9d Sign up to become a member of the Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.',\n",
              "  'Anderson Paak: â€˜If Dre had called five years ago, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d have been readyâ€™ Iâ€™d be lying if I told you that my interview with Anderson Paak gets off to a flying start. The reality is anything but. The 30-year-old rapper and singer-songwriter from Los Angeles is ushered into my cramped hotel room in Salford looking like death warmed up. Heâ€™s battling a nasty flu virus that threatens to derail his European tour. While I do my best to be solicitous, his eyelids droop and he barely speaks. Fearing disaster, I quickly phone for black coffee and, fortunately, it does the trick. He may not be a household name just yet, but Paak is well on the way to becoming one. For a start, he is making some of the most exciting new music around. His sound is a warm and hazy blend of styles â€“ funk, jazz, New York house, reggae, trap, blaxploitation-era soul, a hint of psych-rock â€“ anchored in R&B and hip-hop. He is equally at home singing and rapping. And he has a highly distinctive voice that somehow manages to be both smooth as maple syrup and raspy as a whisky-soaked barfly. Comparisons have been made with Frank Ocean, AndrÃ© 3000 and Innervisions-era Stevie Wonder. Significantly, Paak has also been recently anointed as Dr Dreâ€™s latest protege. The hip-hop mogul and Beats headphones founder has a habit of picking winners, from Snoop Dogg to Eminem, and Paak signed a deal with Dreâ€™s Aftermath Entertainment in January. This followed on from his star turn last August on Dreâ€™s comeback album, Compton. Paak co-wrote and sang on six of the songs, more than any other guest â€“ including Snoop and Eminem, as well as other heavy hitters, such as Ice Cube and Kendrick Lamar. This was a remarkable achievement because at the time Paak was virtually unknown. He had independently released an album, Venice, in late 2014, which won widespread critical acclaim but made little mainstream impact (although it was championed by Gilles Peterson on Radio 6). Paak also had a project called NxWorries, a collaboration with the hip-hop producer Knxwledge â€“ their single Suede went viral in early 2015, and came to the attention of Dre, who apparently played it for weeks before getting one of his A&R team to call Paak and invite him to audition. That must have been quite a moment. Paak flashes a toothy grin and perks up immediately. â€œWhen I finally met him, for some reason I didnâ€™t have any super-fanboy jitter thing, where I couldnâ€™t be myself,â€\\x9d he says. â€œI was so confident by that point I just said: â€˜Let me get on the mic and try something.â€™ And I remember closing my eyes and going off the top, and then opening them and it was like, â€˜Whooaaaahhh!!â€™â€\\x9d He mimes Dre throwing his hands up in the air in appreciation. It probably helped that Paak had already had a lot of practice by the time he met Dre. â€œIf heâ€™d called five years ago, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d have been ready,â€\\x9d he admits. Paak is his real name, by the way. But as an artist he prefixes it with a full stop â€“ .Paak. Itâ€™s a weird affectation, but he tells me it symbolises attention to detail. Itâ€™s a reminder to himself to stay on top of his game because he hasnâ€™t always done so. â€œI thought things would just fall into my lap,â€\\x9d he says. â€œSo Iâ€™d put my career in the hands of just about anybody. And before I knew it I was in my late 20s, and things just werenâ€™t sticking. Plus, in LA image is more than half the battle, and I was just a music nerd who never gave a fuck about image.â€\\x9d Indeed. For most of his 20s he recorded under the name Breezy Lovejoy. â€œI didnâ€™t always take myself that seriously,â€\\x9d he admits. â€œImage-wise, I was somewhat of a jokester.â€\\x9d The first thing he put online as Lovejoy was a Coldplay tribute. â€œI didnâ€™t really know what I was doing,â€\\x9d he says. Eventually it was fatherhood â€“ his son, Soul, is now five years old â€“ that gave him the wake-up call he needed. Since then, he has ditched the cringy Lovejoy alias, stepped up his songwriting game, and independently released two dazzling albums â€“ Venice and, more recently, Malibu in January. Like generations of African American musicians before him, Paak laid the foundations for his career during childhood in church. It was where he learned to play drums, tutored by kindly older musicians who recognised that he had talent; the singing and rapping came later. â€œIf you grow up playing in church, it removes a lot of the boundaries that other musicians might have, growing up with sheet music or whatever,â€\\x9d he says. â€œItâ€™s like [adopts booming preacherâ€™s voice] youâ€™re dealing with the Holy Spirit! Godâ€™s working through your hands!â€\\x9d The church was in Oxnard, a small city 100km from Los Angeles. Brandon Paak Anderson and his three sisters (two older, one younger) were born and raised there, in a mostly white suburb. Church was a focal point for Oxnardâ€™s fragmented black community; his short-lived first marriage at 21 was to a girl he met there. Paakâ€™s mother is mixed race: half-black, half-Korean â€“ he has her eyes. She was orphaned during the Korean war, and adopted by a US soldier who took her back to America and raised her with his family in Compton. His father, meanwhile, was an identical twin from Philadelphia, an air force man who was discharged for drugs â€“ and who ended up severely addicted to both drugs and alcohol, with traumatic consequences. â€œHe went to prison for assault and battery of my mum,â€\\x9d Paak says, with calm detachment. â€œI witnessed him beating my mum. He beat her within an inch of her life. We called the cops and he went to prison for 14 years [he was also found guilty of firearms offences]. I never saw him after that. I talked to him a little bit, but the next time I seen him he was being buried.â€\\x9d Paak was seven years old when he saw the beating. How do you process something like that? â€œI donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s had an effect, but I couldnâ€™t pinpoint exactly what it did. I know I have some issuesâ€¦ maybe if I see a therapist they can tell you!â€\\x9d His mum is clearly a resilient woman who had a flair for business. She took over a small strawberry stall in Oxnard from a friend, and built it into a large organic strawberry company, supplying grocery stores and restaurant chains. She remarried, and â€œlife got very good â€“ we went from living in a one-bedroom apartment to a five-bedroom mansion by the time I was in high school. I had everything I wanted growing up, though all I wanted was music stuff â€“ drums, a PC, turntables. They supported me with all of that.â€\\x9d But their luck changed again: unusually heavy rainstorms linked to the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon ruined the strawberry crops for two consecutive seasons, â€œand everything went to shit. Mom had to file for bankruptcy. But during this time, she also developed a healthy gambling habit. We were in Vegas every weekend. My mom and step-pops were really good, and when youâ€™re really good at gambling, you donâ€™t pay for anything. Everything was on the house. Weâ€™d get all our meals free, all the room service. Iâ€™d bring my friends from school. It was just crazy rooms, dude â€“ TVs coming up out of the floor and shitâ€¦â€\\x9d And then that all went wrong, too. His mum and stepdad were arrested and charged for not declaring their winnings, and for â€œillegally moving securitiesâ€\\x9d. Paak was 17 and knew nothing; he is sketchy about the details even now. â€œThey were making a bunch of money at the tables and not notifying the government â€“ Mom was actually using it to pay back what she owed from the bankruptcy. But when people found out that she had paid others back but not them, they reported her.â€\\x9d His mum served seven and a half years of a 14-year sentence. Around the same time, it emerged that his stepdad had been having an affair, and was having a child with another woman. â€œI never really liked him anyway,â€\\x9d Paak shrugs. â€œWhen my mom went under, everything collapsed. Like, before that we were just spoilt brats. My mom paid for everything. My two older sisters were married with families of their own, but they were still being taken care of. One of them had to move back into the house to take care of me and my little sister â€“ but then the house got foreclosed, so we had to get out.â€\\x9d He has only recently felt able to write about all this â€“ and the years of hard living and family fallouts that followed. There is little sign of it on his light-hearted first album, Venice. But its game-changing follow-up, Malibu, is a much deeper proposition, full of long-buried and painful childhood memories, transformed into bittersweet melodies and woozy, punch-drunk raps. â€œIs you gonna smile when your date gets issued? You know them feds taking pictures/Your momâ€™s in prison, your father needs a new kidney/Your familyâ€™s splitting, rivalries between siblings/If cash ainâ€™t king itâ€™s damn sure the incentive/And good riddance,â€\\x9d he raps on The Season/Carry Me, one of the albumâ€™s many highlights. â€œI guess it just took time,â€\\x9d he says. â€œI donâ€™t think I knew before how to properly express what I had gone through in song form. Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t try to force it before I was ready. Also, itâ€™s part of my personality to be light; Iâ€™m more about lightness than anything.â€\\x9d He clearly has a lot to tell. And Iâ€™m not sure weâ€™ve heard the half of it yet. Not because he is holding back; in fact, quite the opposite. He is such an enthusiastic raconteur that each question elicits lengthy answers, rich in plot twists and biographical minutiae, and in the end we run out of time. His final tale is about the period he spent working on a weed farm. He begins with: â€œSo my [second] wife came in from Korea and she got pregnantâ€¦â€\\x9d and progresses into how, in his desperation to make money, he landed the weed farm job through a fellow musician. Marijuana for medical prescriptions has been legal in California since 1996. â€œI remember looking out over the hills, and there were football fields of the shit, as far as you could see,â€\\x9d he says, before giving me a thorough briefing on how to chop, trim and bag â€œall these huge plants â€“ bigger than you! It was the hardest work of my life, but it was 150 bucks an hour. We were there for everâ€¦â€\\x9d Heâ€™s still telling me about the weed farm when there is a knock at the door â€“ I donâ€™t have time to ask how much of the grass, if any, he smoked himself (his music certainly has a spaced-out quality). Nor to ask about the period of homelessness he and his pregnant wife endured after he was suddenly let go from the weed farm job â€“ and which only ended after he was taken in by Shafiq Husayn, of the alternative hip-hop group Sa-Ra, who put him up until he had finished his Venice album. Our time is up. He has to leave for his gig at Manchesterâ€™s Ruby Lounge. I saw him deliver a high-octane show in London a night earlier. His performance was spectacular, deftly switching between singing and rapping, accompanied by his hipsterish backing band, the Free Nationals. Sadly, tonightâ€™s show turns out to be his last of the tour â€“ the flu forces him to cancel the rest. But the tour has nevertheless been a success. The venues have been modest, but each sold out. And bigger shows will follow in the wake of the recent deal with Dreâ€™s Aftermath Entertainment, guaranteeing the future backing of one of the most powerful men in music. But for now thereâ€™s something gratifying about watching an artist whose success has been gradual and hard-won. His tale is a salutary reminder that even in the internet era, it can still be a long way to the top. Is he dreaming of even bigger things now? â€œYou gotta dream!â€\\x9d he grins. â€œBut Iâ€™m still very much aware of whatâ€™s going on right now. Iâ€™ve done a bunch of shitty club work playing drums for other people, and now Iâ€™m on tour â€“ with a whole van! Full of our shit! Our merch, our equipmentâ€¦ our show!â€\\x9d And with that, R&Bâ€™s newest and least pretentious star heads off to inject some lightness into the Salford gloom. Heâ€™s living the dream already. Malibu is out now on Steel Wool/OBE/Art Club. Anderson .Paak plays the Wireless festival, Finsbury Park, London N4 on 10 July and the Reading/Leeds festival on 27-28 August; ticketmaster.co.uk',\n",
              "  'Married couples more politically split this election, thanks to Donald Trump Donald Trump shared some marital advice at a recent campaign stop in Virginia: â€œIf your wife got angry with you,â€\\x9d he said, â€œsay: â€˜Iâ€™m just sorry, Charlotte, Iâ€™m going out to vote for Trump.â€™â€\\x9d As his poll numbers are cratering among every demographic except white men, support for the Republican nominee is dividing couples at a level far beyond the last presidential election. A new poll exclusive to the reveals that in households across the US, Trump is fueling a deep split among married couples. In the online poll of 1,249 adults who have been in a relationship since at least 2012, polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs asked whether spousesâ€™ political leanings had diverged in the last four years. The results provide evidence that the most pronounced divisions were found in households where both spouses consider themselves politically independent. â€œWe can say, with some caveats, that many Trump voters are really not confident that their spouses are going to support Trump,â€\\x9d said Chris Jackson, an Ipsos pollster. While only one in 10 people supporting Hillary Clinton thought their spouses would vote another way, one in five supporting Trump expect their spouses to vote for someone else. Among men and women who supported Trump or Clinton, men voting for Trump were the least confident that their spouses would do the same. The results may come as no surprise after 13 months of campaigning in which Trump has made a number of sexist remarks. In the most memorable example, at the first Republican debate in 2015, Fox News host Megyn Kelly challenged Trump to explain â€œseveral disparaging comments about womenâ€™s looksâ€\\x9d. â€œYouâ€™ve called women you donâ€™t like â€˜fat pigs,â€™ â€˜dogsâ€™, â€˜slobsâ€™ and â€˜disgusting animalsâ€™,â€\\x9d she said. â€œYou once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?â€\\x9d These remarks from his past, including the suggestion that he would date his own daughter if they were not related, have shadowed his candidacy for over a year. Clintonâ€™s team has tried to capitalize, highlighting reports that Trump once said of women, â€œYou have to treat â€™em like shit.â€\\x9d â€œBetween married men and married women, there is a record gender gap right now,â€\\x9d said Celinda Lake, head of the Democratic polling firm Lake Research Partners. Married women, a group won by the Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, are currently supporting Clinton by about 12 points, Lake said. â€œWe have a situation where Donald Trumpâ€™s personal style is just so offensive to women, and it is much more salient to women than it is to men.â€\\x9d Some husbands seem less than thrilled by this dynamic. In voter interviews, Lake has noticed an unusual number of married women reporting that their husbands have pressed them to vote for Trump. â€œWeâ€™ve had it come up in our focus groups extensively,â€\\x9d Lake said. â€œThat always happens toward the end, but itâ€™s coming up in this election much sooner than usual.â€\\x9d In Columbus, Ohio, three door-to-door canvassers for Working America, a group affiliated with the labor federation AFL-CIO, reported similar versions of the same story: after leaving a house where the husband planned to vote for Trump, the wife chased the canvasser down the street to say that under no circumstances would she do the same. â€œWeâ€™re certainly picked up tensions between husbands and wives before, but this kind of manifestation was really stunning to our field staff,â€\\x9d said Karen Nussbaum, executive director of Working America, which is campaigning on behalf of Clinton and other Democrats. â€œThis level of passion around the candidates, and then the big divisions between men and women is at a different level than weâ€™ve seen in the past.â€\\x9d Even in a typical election year, more women tend to vote Democrat than men, and households split between the major parties are not uncommon. Same-sex couples make up too small a share of respondents to be represented in most national polls. But there is evidence that the split is particularly acute in 2016. In the Ipsos poll, only about half of those who said their household was split this year believed they and their spouse voted differently in 2012. That is the position in which George Kraft, 68, finds himself. Kraft, of Bullhead City, Arizona, said he and his wife both voted for Romney in 2012. This fall, he plans to vote for Trump. His wife, however, wants nothing to do with the partyâ€™s inflammatory standard-bearer. â€œShe thinks heâ€™s too outspoken, too abrasive toward other people,â€\\x9d Kraft said. The same controversies donâ€™t bother him. â€œMaybe thatâ€™s what we need.â€\\x9d Although the most drastic splits have surfaced between independent couples, Trump is also faring poorly among Republican women, married or not. In some recent polls among women who identify as Republicans, he has run nearly 20 points behind Romney, John McCain (the 2008 nominee) and George W Bush (2004). Romney and Bush won 93% of Republican womenâ€™s votes and McCain in 2008 won 89%. One respondent from Utah, Cheryl Steele, 36, voted without reservations for Romney but said she did not like the way Trump attracted accusations of racism and bigotry. â€œI donâ€™t even want my child to listen to his speeches,â€\\x9d she said, â€œand yet heâ€™s supposed to be my president?â€\\x9d Trumpâ€™s unpopularity with women, Nussbaum said, is reflected in a dynamic her canvassers have seen over and over in the field. â€œMen who love Trump love women who love Hillary. Or at least, they donâ€™t hate Hillary,â€\\x9d she said. Susan, 62, who lives near the border of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, did not wish to give her last name. She plans to vote for Clinton, repulsed by reports that Trump stiffed many of the contractors who helped build his casinos. â€œI have no use for a man like that,â€\\x9d she said. But her choice is causing strife between her and her husband, who she called a â€œvictim of talk radioâ€\\x9d. She believes he will be voting for Trump. â€œI donâ€™t recall us ever arguing about an election before this one,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIâ€™ll come out with â€˜Trump said thisâ€™ and weâ€™ll have a fight.â€\\x9d To avoid any more quarrels, Susan has begun skirting talk of the election altogether. â€œWeâ€™re too old for that,â€\\x9d she said. Lake believes many couples try to excise politics from their relationships, and not just in the heated final months of the 2016 race. Several years ago, her firm conducted a survey in which 72% of men but only 49% of women said with confidence that their partners would vote the same way they did. â€œWe called it the, â€˜Sure, honeyâ€™ factor,â€\\x9d Lake said. â€œGuys just assume who their wives are voting for. And I think some women go, â€˜Sure, honey.â€™â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'SFO ends foreign exchange fraud inquiry with no charges brought A long-running investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into rigging of the Â£3.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets has ended without any charges being issued against banks or individuals. The SFO said that after reviewing more than a half a million documents it had concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. â€œWhile there were reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of offences involving serious or complex fraud, a detailed review of the available evidence led us to the conclusion that the alleged conduct, even if proven and taken at its highest, would not meet the evidential test required to mount a prosecution for an offence contrary to English law,â€\\x9d the SFO said. â€œIt has further been concluded that this evidential position could not be remedied by continuing the investigation.â€\\x9d The prosecutor did not disclose how much the investigation had cost or whether banks or individuals had been the subject of its investigation, which was sparked when the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) provided it with information in July 2014. This year the SFO asked the government for an extra Â£21m to help it keep pursuing complex cases, such as those centred on foreign exchange, after it had received Â£10m last June. Alison McHaffie, a regulatory partner with CMS law firm, said the decision to drop the case showed â€œthe difficult job the SFO has in demonstrating criminal activity by individuals for this type of type of market misconduct and without a change in the law on corporate criminal responsibility. â€œThis means it is always easier to impose regulatory fines against the firms themselves rather than criminal prosecutions.â€\\x9d At the time it launched the forex investigation in 2014, more than 20 individuals had either been suspended or fired from financial institutions during the global investigation into currency rigging. The Bank of England also became embroiled in the scandal, and has previously released minutes of meetings held over six years until 2013 between bank officials and a group of foreign exchange traders. Since then, the FCA and regulators in the US have levied record fines of more than Â£6bn on banks for rigging foreign exchange markets and published pages of electronic messages showing that the individuals involved called themselves the â€œA-teamâ€\\x9d, â€œthe playersâ€\\x9d and â€œthe three musketeersâ€\\x9d. The regulators published conversations between traders, some of whom used the name â€œ1 team, 1 dreamâ€\\x9d, and reported that one had said: â€œHow can I make free money with no fcking [sic] heads up.â€\\x9d When a string of fines was announced in March 2015, Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, had accused bank traders of behaving with â€œbreathtaking flagrancyâ€\\x9d. She extracted guilty pleas from Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Citigroup and JP Morgan. The SFO said it was continuing to liaise with the US Department of Justice over its investigation and it was grateful for help from the FCA, the Competition and Markets Authority and the City of London police, as well as the DoJ and Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The foreign exchange rigging scandal erupted at a time when the reputation of the banking industry was being hammered by revelations that traders had been manipulating Libor, a benchmark interest rate used to price Â£3.5tn of financial products and loans. That benchmark has since been overhauled as a result of the criticism that erupted as further multimillion-pound fines were levied against banks. Barclays was the first bank to be fined for Libor fixing when it was hit with a Â£290m fine in June 2012, which triggered the resignation of the chief executive, Bob Diamond â€“ who was not accused of wrongdoing â€“ and wave of other penalties on a wide range of banks, including RBS and the Swiss bank UBS. The investigation into Libor rigging by the SFO has secured the conviction of Tom Hayes â€“ who is serving 11 years â€“ while six individuals have been cleared by jury. The Libor rigging scandal also spurred George Osborne into changing how the fines levied by the City regulator were used. They had previously gone back to the FCA and its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, but he changed the rules to ensure that the cash â€“ minus costs â€“ went to the Treasury.',\n",
              "  'Social care catastrophe wonâ€™t be solved by integration with healthcare services Your editorial (Social care and the NHS: canâ€™t pay, wonâ€™t pay, 1 February) fails to grasp the enormity of the crisis for social care in England and the inadequacy of George Osborneâ€™s 2% precept. My report on social care in Cambridgeshire, Social Care: The Silent Catastrophe, published last week, shows that an additional Â£500m a year from the precept by 2020 will not compensate for the further Â£6.1bn a year being taken away from English local authorities by the government at the same time. The autumn statement fails to face up to the consequences of the governmentâ€™s decision in 2011 to withdraw its entire general grant to local authorities by the end of this parliament. This is why the social care crisis has now become a catastrophe which goes much wider than support to older people. Support to vulnerable children and young people in care in Cambridgeshire has been cut for the last three years and will be cut yet again in this yearâ€™s budget. In Cambridgeshire social care faces additional cuts of Â£73m a year by 2020, despite the substantial growth in numbers of adults and children urgently needing help. The county council has made clear that its savings proposals contain â€œan unprecedented level of riskâ€\\x9d. In addition, the large cost of implementing the new national minimum wage, which mainly affects social care, has not been funded at all by the government. If the 2% council tax is levied it will just about cover this as-yet-unfunded cost and will not reduce the cuts. Integration of social care and health for older people is not the answer. More resources are required now. David Plank Trumpington, Cambridgeshire â€¢ Your editorial is misleading in presenting as alternatives to the current chaos the combination of health and social care budgets and/or the integration of services for elderly people. Rather than alternatives, they instead act as diversions. The UK spends far less on both social care and healthcare than comparable countries, and little will be gained from pooling. The real issue is that without a secure long-term plan for social care (and the NHS) there will be insufficient investment by individuals, families, the private sector, the NHS and local authorities. Successive governments have avoided the issue, but the problem it creates is as follows. Without sufficient long-term funding and investment in social care, the increasing demographic pressures will require additional investment in hospitals in the short term. By clutching too long to the straw that investments in alternatives to hospitals will avoid this, and then failing to deliver these, successive governments have merely added to the total costs and misery. The latest miasma surrounding the potential for â€œtransformationâ€\\x9d of the NHS courtesy of the management consultancy industry and lots of earmarked money is a sure indication that the issue continues to be avoided. Only Sweden has fewer hospital beds than the UK, but it spends 10% of GDP extra on health and social care! There are no easy alternatives to reaching agreement on the long-term plan. Roger Steer Healthcare Audit Consultants  â€¢ Your editorial is right about the crisis but unduly pessimistic about the solution. Joining up health and social care budgets is not â€œtoo hardâ€\\x9d. It does require political will and it will require some extra tax funding to make it happen. But it is the only way to create a fair, simple and sustainable care and health system that can meet the needs of our ageing population by supporting older people at or near their homes. To accept anything less will make todayâ€™s care crisis seem relatively minor by 2020. Stephen Burke Director, United for All Ages and Good Care Guide â€¢ Your editorial is right to identify the relationship between the NHS and adult social care, and highlight both their shared challenges, and that the coming year represents an opportunity to make decisions to help address them. The suggested macro solutions that you mention are welcome and necessary: combining budgets and integrating services. However, the article could have made explicit another linked and more tangible option that is crucial to the deliverability of the above. By expanding and scaling up the type of activities and approaches that are already delivering effective outcomes, we can keep more people out of hospital and reduce pressures on budgets. Options such as the Shared Lives model of care are already supporting around 13,000 people nationally to live good lives and avoid prolonged hospital or institutional care. Many other approaches across the country are focusing on local, citizen-led commissioning and are delivering spectacular results at a small scale. The five-year forward view, and the increasing engagement of CCGs locally in new ways of doing things, shows that this potential is recognised by the NHS and social care leaders. 2016 is the right time to embed this welcome approach even wider. Alex Fox Chief executive, Shared Lives Plus â€¢ The funding of social care is inadequate, causing distress to elderly and disabled people, and increased costs from bedblocking for insolvent NHS hospitals. Local government funding has been cut by 25% since 2010, with more cuts to come. However, the distribution of these cuts is grossly unequal. The principle of equalising local authority spending was abandoned in 2012-13. Consequently, deprived areas now get disproportionately bigger cuts in their allocations. The planned parsimony of government is deliberately cutting the funding of deprived areas such as Liverpool and Newcastle more than better-off areas.

              "  \"Sadiq Khan's big city way could be Labour's way forward nationally Speaking to Sky News, Sadiq Khan has urged Theresa May to delay pressing the Brexit button - triggering Article 50, which starts the formal process of withdrawal from the EU - until next autumn, arguing that this would improve the UKâ€™s chances of getting a decent deal. By way of Square Mile free sheet City AM, Khanâ€™s deputy mayor for business, Rajesh Agrawal, has said that City Hall officials are talking to counterparts in Paris and other cities beyond Europe about building their own business relationships for the Brexit age. This is a developing theme. Within days of the referendum result in June, Khan joined with the City of London in calling for UK-regulated banks to retain their existing â€œpassporting rightsâ€\\x9d, the system that allows them to operate in the EU nations. Anything less would be â€œa disasterâ€\\x9d, he said. More recently, he has reactivated the London Finance Commission, asking it to come up with further proposals for making London more autonomous, in the interests of the UK as a whole. Heâ€™s telling anyone whoâ€™ll listen that London Is Open. Khan is banging the devolution drum at every opportunity, seeking further scope for City Hall and the capitalâ€™s 33 local authorities to take command of the capitalâ€™s destiny. How far he will get depends heavily on how receptive the new prime minister and her colleagues are to his case, but itâ€™s significant that the media as well as ministers are listening. That significance extends to the Labour Party. With its national leadership failing to provide effective opposition either in the House of Commons or the country at large, the views of Khan are seen as mattering still more. He is, after all, the Labour politician with the most power to put policies into effect and seems likely to remain so for some time. He should, though, have some company before long. Next May, counterpart â€œmetro mayorsâ€\\x9d are due to be elected to lead Greater Manchester and the Liverpool and West Midlands city regions. Labourâ€™s candidates for those jobs, now selected, are strong favourites to win. Their powers will vary and differ from Khanâ€™s, as will the types of territories they serve. They will, though, look to London as a model. They too will negotiate with the Conservative government about ways to make their economies stronger. They too will surely also look beyond Westminster to the wider, post-Brexit world in their searches for growth and prosperity. They and Khan could be the faces of Labour in power in Britain for many years to come.\",\n",
              "  \"Donald Trump is technology's befuddled (but dangerous) grandfather Technology? Bah humbug: â€œI think we ought to get on with our lives,â€\\x9d said Donald Trump on Wednesday, summing up his take on the complex problem of apparently Russian phishing attacks on multiple Democratic party groups during the 2016 election. As the White Houseâ€™s current resident prepared to impose sanctions on Russia for hacking, Trump said: â€œI think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly whatâ€™s going on.â€\\x9d Itâ€™s not the first time the president-elect has been stumped by the digital world, like a technophobe who unwrapped a computer-operated nuclear arsenal on Christmas morning. And the trouble isnâ€™t that nobody knows exactly whatâ€™s going on in the â€œage of computerâ€\\x9d â€“ itâ€™s that technology poses some of the most complex problems in human history to the incoming administration. And its leader is a man who refers to â€œthe cyberâ€\\x9d and seems more concerned about the weight of the hacker, or possibly the bed â€“ his syntax is mysterious â€“ than about who broke into the Democratic National Committee. US authorities spent 2016 attempting to chart new territory even beyond the DNC, DCCC and Clinton campaign hacks: how can Americans protect their infrastructure from attacks on the foundations of the internet, such as the Mirai botnet siege in October that took down some of the biggest, and most sophisticated, tech companies in the world? How can the nationâ€™s patchwork of electoral authorities repair voting systems prone to massive, potentially catastrophic error? How should the government treat open-source encryption? Trump remains silent on the details of digital policy as the leader-to-be of a government in desperate need of consistent guiding principles. Instead, Trump appears to regard technology as a contact point for the same obsessions that drove his campaign. He is blase about warrantless surveillance â€“ he has said it â€œwould be fineâ€\\x9d to restore the NSAâ€™s bulk data collection programs, a position his pick for CIA director, Mike Pompeo, also endorses, as does Trumpâ€™s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions. He is far more actively concerned about appearing stronger than his predecessor, Barack Obama, and as always about Chinese activity in cyberspace: Especially when they start â€œcyber hacking usâ€\\x9d: He also occasionally made time during the campaign to mock opponent Hillary Clinton for getting sick and getting hacked: Trump has been general, albeit chilling, on the topic of what exactly his administration will do: as an extension of Trumpâ€™s ideology, information gathering will serve to do the unthinkable â€“ his own word. â€œWeâ€™re going to have to do things that we never did before,â€\\x9d he told Yahoo News. â€œAnd some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule. And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so weâ€™re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.â€\\x9d The apparent lack of interest in the minutiae of his own positions has left his administrationâ€™s tech strategy in the hands of Peter Thiel, the thin-skinned billionaire founder of PayPal who quietly bankrolled former pro wrestler Hulk Hoganâ€™s annihilating lawsuit against news outlet Gawker, apparently in retaliation for an article about Thielâ€™s sexual orientation. Earlier this month, Thiel indulged Trumpâ€™s own grudge against Twitter during the president-electâ€™s â€œtech summitâ€\\x9d at Trump Tower, shutting out the organization that provides Trump with his loudest megaphone reportedly because Twitter refused to add an emoji to the Trump campaignâ€™s #CrookedHillary sponsored hashtag during the election. Another of Thielâ€™s companies, data-mining firm Palantir, already plays a powerful role: the companyâ€™s services are likely to be used in any effort to deport undocumented immigrants, according to multiple reports. But for the president-elect himself, technology appears to be yet another venue for increasingly dangerous hobbies including threats to cut programs that benefit US allies, brinksmanship with China and unraveling Obamacare. Trump calls net neutrality â€œa top-down power grabâ€\\x9d that â€œwill target conservative mediaâ€\\x9d; he has often repeated his support for a registry of American Muslims, and generally demonstrates not merely a lack of proficiency in technology but a contempt for expertise. But like every rich guy who wants to stay that way, he keeps a couple of eggheads around, and between him and them, when it comes to tech policy they will make America â€¦ something. Possibly not great.\",\n",
              "  'Deadpool; Bone Tomahawk; Heart of a Dog; Nasty Baby; Alan Clarke at the BBC â€“ review Superhero films, in all their Lycra-wrapped machismo, are easy enough for sceptics to mock; once the film-makers join in, however, a strained sense of regimented fun creeps into proceedings. So it is with Deadpool (Fox, 15), an eager but terminally smug exercise in self-aware Marvel prankery that leaves no fourth wall undemolished. Starring Ryan Reynolds as an ex-military victim of medical experimentation left with superhuman healing powers and super-irksome wisecracks, Tim Millerâ€™s film follows the Kick-Ass course of self-covering provocation: sadism or sexism with a wink, it reasons, isnâ€™t sadism or sexism. (Deadpoolâ€™s girlfriend may be a colourless stock figure, but she does get to sodomise him. Feminists, you are hereby appeased.) It feigns offensiveness, though only those appalled by hormonal schoolboys need take umbrage. Credit where itâ€™s due to Reynolds, who sells the whole thing with smarm and charm that arenâ€™t mutually exclusive, but this is a glib, greasy idea of fun. For violently funny subversion of Boyâ€™s Own fare, look instead to Bone Tomahawk (The Works, 18), S Craig Zahlerâ€™s splendid, morbid revival of the cowboys and Indians western. The palefacesâ€™ enemy this time is a fantastical tribe of mutant cannibals (â€œMen like you wouldnâ€™t distinguish them from Indians,â€\\x9d one Native American character pointedly observes) who kidnap some local townsfolk, setting sheriff Kurt Russell and his motley crew off in hard-squinting pursuit. Zahler has an adoring eye and ear for the idiom of Hollywoodâ€™s old west, with a salty, satirical streak that frankly outclasses Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s recent strain of pastiche. The film then thrillingly jackknifes into fresh, bloody B-movie terrain, yet even at its most viscerally grisly points, Zahlerâ€™s limber, literate way with language never deserts him: listen out especially for the sublime Richard Jenkinsâ€™s monologue about circus fleas. As beguiling as it is utterly classification-resistant, Laurie Andersonâ€™s roving personal essay Heart of a Dog (Dogwoof, E) got a tad lost in cinemas last month, but should be cherished on small screens. Beginning as a grief-stricken Valentine to the film-makerâ€™s late terrier, it unrolls with graceful imprecision into a meditation on narrative, music, philosophy, even the paranoia of post-9/11 America. Its cobweb connections make far more sense seen than described. Simpler in its sweetness is Our Little Sister (Curzon, PG), an unashamedly small tale of sibling bonds lost and found that accrues power with its accumulation of fine domestic (and fragrantly culinary) details. Itâ€™s less preoccupied with emotional escalation than some of director Hirokazu Koreedaâ€™s more acclaimed works, and more moving for it. Far more acrid human observation is to be found in Chilean-American auteur SebastiÃ¡n Silvaâ€™s Nasty Baby (Network, 15), in which a gay coupleâ€™s attempt to conceive a child with a female friend (Kristen Wiig) goes off course via a neck-snapping plot twist that I found at once exhilarating and unconvincing. Reissue of the week, by a long yard, is Dissent & Disruption: Alan Clarke at the BBC (1969-1989) (BFI, 18), a mammoth compilation of the gut-spilling social realistâ€™s collected TV dramas, alongside his feature films Scum and The Firm, here presented in a new directorâ€™s cut. The total comes to 13 discs, 33 hours and more than a hundred quid; an investment for the committed, not the curious. Iâ€™m still working my way through, but itâ€™s a stunning assembly: the cleaned-up transfers havenâ€™t lightened the dirt under these filmsâ€™ nails one bit. Finally, you have just over two weeks left to head to Mubi.com and stream the yearâ€™s most dizzying swirl of cinema so far: Miguel Gomesâ€™s Arabian Nights trilogy, a bounding, incandescent triptych of films themselves composed of profuse interlocking parts, addressing history, mythology and contemporary European economics through its own eccentric version of Scheherazadeâ€™s storybook. There are chaffinches and ghost dogs here; Gomes juggles personal and political grievances here, finding room for love, law and Lionel Richie. At over six hours, it sounds imposing, but proves a leisurely, enveloping wallow.',\n",
              "  'Trump seeking quickest way to quit Paris climate agreement, says report Donald Trump is looking at quick ways of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement in defiance of widening international backing for the plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Reuters has reported. Since the US president-elect was chosen, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed support for the 2015 Paris agreement at 200-nation climate talks running until 18 November in Marrakesh, Morocco. But, according to Reuters, a source in the Trump transition team said the victorious Republican, who has called global warming a hoax, was considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord. â€œIt was reckless for the Paris agreement to enter into force before the election,â€\\x9d said the source, who works on Trumpâ€™s transition team for international energy and climate policy, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Paris agreement went into force on 4 November, four days before last Tuesdayâ€™s election. Alternatives were to send a letter withdrawing from a 1992 convention that is the parent treaty of the Paris agreement, voiding US involvement in both in a yearâ€™s time, or to issue a presidential order simply deleting the US signature from the Paris accord, the source told Reuters. Many nations have expressed hopes the United States will stay. Morocco, the host for the talks, said the agreement that seeks to phase out greenhouse gases in the second half of the century was strong enough to survive a pullout. â€œIf one party decides to withdraw that it doesnâ€™t call the agreement into question,â€\\x9d foreign minister Salaheddine Mezouar told a news conference. Despite the threat of a US withdrawal, US secretary of state John Kerry said on Sunday that he would continue his efforts to implement the Paris agreement until Barack Obama leaves office on 20 January. Speaking in New Zealand following a trip to Antarctica, Kerry appeared to take a swipe at Trump when he listed some of the ways in which global warming could already be seen. He said that there were more fires, floods and damaging storms around the world, and sea levels were rising. â€œThe evidence is mounting in ways that people in public life should not dare to avoid accepting as a mandate for action,â€\\x9d Kerry said. â€œNow the worldâ€™s scientific community has concluded that climate change is happening beyond any doubt. And the evidence is there for everybody to see,â€\\x9d Kerry said. The Paris agreement was reached by almost 200 nations in December and, as of Saturday, has been formally ratified by 109 representing 76% of greenhouse gas emissions, including the United States with 18%. The accord seeks to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels. United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa declined to comment on the Trump sourceâ€™s remarks to Reuters. â€œThe Paris agreement carries an enormous amount of weight and credibility,â€\\x9d she told a news conference. She said the UN hoped for a strong and constructive relationship with Trump. The Trump source blamed US president Barack Obama for joining up by an executive order, without getting approval from the Senate. â€œThere wouldnâ€™t be this diplomatic fallout on the broader international agenda if Obama hadnâ€™t rushed the adoption,â€\\x9d he said.',\n",
              "  'The future of shopping: drones, digital mannequins and leaving without paying Amazon may be set to bring its hi-tech till-free stores to the UK after registering the Amazon Go brand name in the UK last week. At the test store near Amazonâ€™s HQ in Seattle, an app tracks customers as they walk about, recording the items they pick up and take away. The store is currently only available to company staff, but will open to shoppers from next year. The cost of purchases will be automatically billed to their account. The company has registered the Amazon Go trademark in the UK for an extensive list of potential uses, from technology, telecommunications and retail services to food and drink services and even pet food. The retailer claims the Amazon Go store is â€œthe worldâ€™s most advanced shopping technologyâ€\\x9d but other businesses are also trialling shop-assistant-free concepts. The NaÌˆraffaÌˆr convenience store based in an isolated village in Sweden, for example, relies on a mobile app which lets residents access the store, scan their shopping and then pay via a monthly invoice. Theyâ€™re part of a wave of new gadgetry which could dramatically change the way we shop: Robot assistants Some may argue that many stores have these already, but retailers are moving on, with a view to replacing staff with sophisticated software. The American DIY chain Loweâ€™s is testing LoweBot, a customer service robot that speaks several languages, helps shoppers find items and provides information on products. First trialled as OSHbot two years ago, it is currently being tested in 11 Loweâ€™s stores. US electricals retailer Best Buy has Chloe, a robot that is a glorified grabber arm for CDs and DVDs, while Aldebaran Robotics, part of the Japanese telecoms firm Softbank, has created Pepper, a humanoid robot which has been deployed in some NescafÃ© stores in Japan. Some US shopping centres are even adopting robotic security guards â€“ a cross between a CCTV camera and a Dalek that can detect people who may be loitering in the wrong place and read car number plates in car parks. But itâ€™s not all been straightforward: a robot guarding a shopping centre in California recently ran over a toddler after its navigational scanning systems failed to detect the small boy. A virtual you For many shoppers, buying clothes online is a very hit-and-miss affair. Sizes vary between outlets and getting the right fit means many clothing items are returned â€“ which is bad for both the shopper and the shopkeeper. That could change thanks to new software that creates an accurate 3D model of the shopper, meaning it is possible to â€œtry onâ€\\x9d clothes. Cambridge based startup Metail, which has raised $20m to date and is backed by Hong Kong clothing giant Tal, is setting the pace. The companyâ€™s technology can be plugged into retailersâ€™ websites so customers can create what it calls â€œMe Modelsâ€\\x9d as well as 3D images of the products on sale. Shoppers can then find out if a pair of tight jeans will give them a muffin top. Retailers will also be able to use customer data to suggest outfits, creating a â€œNetflix styleâ€\\x9d shopping experience. Digital butlers Doing the shopping may soon require nothing other than a shiny little box. Nearly all the major tech firms, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook, are developing digital home assistants that respond to voice commands. As an online retailer, itâ€™s not surprising that Amazon has ensured its Echo device is easy to shop with â€“ thanks to the Alexa app, which lets you shout out a shopping list, to add to a virtual trolley, as you walk around the house. Eventually these assistants should learn what you want and when you want it without commands. But these devices may be very shortlived â€“ because home appliances like fridges, coffee machines and printers have already been developed that are linked to the internet so they can automatically replenish themselves without any interaction with their owner. Drone deliveries As retail sales increasingly transfer from the high street to the internet, one of the biggest problems for retailers is making deliveries. In busy cities where traffic congestion is a problem, one solution already being tested is using drones. In the summer, Amazon started working with the UK government to test the viability of delivering small parcels â€“ which make up 90% of Amazonâ€™s sales â€“ by drone. In the US, Mercedes-Benz is collaborating with drone startup Matternet on the â€œVision Vanâ€\\x9d, where a vehicleâ€™s roof doubles as a launch pad for drones capable of sorties of up to 12 miles. Google has also shown off a fixed-wing drone capable of carrying packages. However, beyond the special testing privileges granted to Amazon, current UK legislation bans drones from being flown within 50 metres of a building or a person, or within 150 metres of a built-up area. Aircraft pilots have also expressed concern about the dangers posed by drones after a number of near-misses in London and Manchester.',\n",
              "  'Sacha Baron Cohen has trashed Grimsby â€“ but these places had it far worse After painting Kazakhstan as an atavistic hole of Jew-haters, inbreeders and clock-radio coveters in Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen is poised in his new film to besmirch the reputation of Lincolnshireâ€™s most self-flagellatingly named estuarial port town, Grimsby. Chav Central seems to be the keynote. No one in current cinema trashes a place quite like Baron Cohen â€“ but there have been plenty of outstanding demolition jobs, like the 10 below. Merely kitchen-sink or â€œauthenticâ€\\x9d treatments didnâ€™t cut it for the list â€“ contenders had to demonstrate actual malicious, distorting and/or resident-slandering intent. The Australian outback (Wake in Fright) The Aussie wastes are always foreboding on film. But they become a perpetually hungover, exit-less purgatory in this 1971 Ozploitation classic in which a schoolteacher en route to Sydney gets waylaid in the mining town of Bundanyabba (AKA â€œthe Yabbaâ€\\x9d). The sickening amount of West End lager consumed amid the endless gambling sessions and kangaroo pogroms ranks as the most counterproductive example of product placement ever. Georgia, USA (Deliverance) Come to Georgia! Tackle the thorny hillbilly accent! Pit yourself against ominous banjo-playing idiot savants! Step into the wilderness and find yourself the sexual plaything of devious, dentally challenged mountain men! Bizarrely, John Boormanâ€™s anti-tourist board ad actually increased interest in the southern state, sparking a whitewater rafting boom on the Chattooga river for those coming to hear the surrounding hills echoing with the sounds of evil redneck chuckling. Chinatown, everywhere (Chinatown) No one is denying that Chinatowns worldwide have the odd problem with organised crime and food-standards violations. They didnâ€™t ask, though, to be made into some kind of international byword for total spiritual perdition. Orientalists everywhere thrilled to the climax of 1947â€™s The Lady from Shanghai when Orson Wellesâ€™ protagonist is spun around in front of Asian eyes (inscrutable, of course). But, setting PI Jake Gittes on a similar trajectory, Roman Polanskiâ€™s 70s Los Angeles masterpiece takes the misfortune cookie. Message: â€œYour grandadâ€™s also your dad.â€\\x9d The Scottish Highlands (Breaking the Waves) Like Colorado in Dogville, Lars von Trier gives the impression of never having set foot in the real north of Scotland, lest it complicate a picture-postcard conceptual backdrop for his favourite hobby: subjecting his lead character to a set of directorial ordeals. The stony-faced Calvinist elders and feral schoolchildren who prowled the land and dead-eyed rapey sailors lurking offshore were supposedly from the 1970s. Were it not for Emily Watsonâ€™s PVC skirt, the red phonebox, and Bowie and Elton on the soundtrack, youâ€™d have mistaken it for the 1770s. Swansea (Twin Town) Renton and crew operated in Edinburghâ€™s margins, but the leering, droog-eyed brothers at the heart of the â€œWelsh Trainspottingâ€\\x9d are practically mascots of a â€œpretty shitty cityâ€\\x9d. Kevin Allenâ€™s Swansea is a beacon of cheerful hypocrisy; a place where rugby balls come stuffed full of coke, and the timeless pillars of Welsh life conceal a hotbed of joyriding, piss-drizzled karaoke and routine caninocide. Mogadishu, Somalia (Black Hawk Down) The Somalian capital city was admittedly no Viennese ballroom in the early 90s, when the UN peacekeeping mission went belly-up. But so one-sided was Ridley Scottâ€™s account of one bad-tempered afternoon there, the entire urban infrastructure seems to exist solely to spew out a 28 Days Later-like stream of AK-toting fanatics whoâ€™ve been waiting all their lives to tear off a piece of a helicopter rotor. Another little-known Mogadishu fact unearthed by Scott: unusually for a city in the midst of the famously homogenous Horn of Africa gene pool, it is entirely populated by people from other parts of Africa. Paris (IrrÃ©versible) Hub of the Enlightenment, city of romance, home of button-cute AmÃ©lie Poulain â€“ all rendered null and void as Gaspar NoÃ© reduces the Paris street map to one sulphurous red underpass and forces us to watch nine minutes of rape and battery. Everyone would have settled for some unconvincing, Daft Punk-soundtracked mime instead. After that, itâ€™s an impossibly long road back to heaven in his metaphysical journey through one night out in the capital. Romania (The Romanian new wave) This artistic vanguard swept the cobwebs of Transylvanian gothic cool away and, in a series of bleak but devastating noughties films, made the eastern European country known for something else: being a traumatised, towerblock-palisaded post-commie fiefdom in which if you werenâ€™t literally dying (The Death of Mr Lazarescu), you could while away your allotted span on earth hunting down a backstreet abortion (4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days), denying your sexuality in a convent (Beyond the Hills), or suffering slow bureaucratic strangulation (Police, Adjective). Slovakia (Hostel) American xenophobia is a well-trodden story route, but Eli Roth really ran with it in the 2005 film that inaugurated the movie genre known as torture porn. Of course the whole of the European hospitality industry is some kind of sinister conspiratorial network designed to entrap gullible fratboy backpackers. Where else but darkest newly capitalistic eastern Europe, trafficking in every base human impulse, would host a sinister white-collar murder ring? Naturally one of the participants bears a striking resemblance to a famously unhinged Japanese director: pass me the cheesewire, eh, Miike? Bruges (In Bruges) â€œIf I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didnâ€™t, so it doesnâ€™t.â€\\x9d Thanks to writer/director Martin McDonaghâ€™s un-PC exuberance, Colin Farrell tramples all over chocolate-box Belgium; a heritage honeypot so boring that it appeals only to the unhinged inner child in Ralph Fiennesâ€™ warbly-voiced psychopath mobster. â€œHow can fucking swans not fucking be someoneâ€™s fucking thing?â€\\x9d How indeed. â€¢ Grimsby is released on 24 February.',\n",
              "  'ArsÃ¨ne Wenger pleased Arsenal now have the experience to win ugly Plan B. For so many years, that concept was lobbed at ArsÃ¨ne Wenger come times of trouble in accusing tones. Plan B was the thing that Arsenal did not have and, on the occasions when their passing game did not click, when their creativity was squeezed, when their fluency dried up, Plan B taunted them by its very absence. In the last couple of matches Arsenal have needed something from the Plan B school. These were games three and four of the mini-series over Christmas and new year where tiredness, the lack of options to rotate because of injuries and a hint of knocked momentum inflicted by that 4-0 thumping at Southampton, meant Arsenal were not at their best. In both games the breakthrough came from a defender, whose determination to make a difference from a set piece paved the way for three precious points. After Gabriel powered in a header against Bournemouth Laurent Koscielny bounded into position to give Arsenal the edge over Newcastle. Wenger is not the type naturally to love a game that depends on dredging up reserves of effort. But his satisfaction was obvious at the end of a hard-fought victory because of everything it told him about the spirit of his team. â€œYou fight, not to concede a goal, not panic and wait for your chance. We were more questioned on that aspect than the way we play football so it is good sometimes to win like that. Watching Newcastle I was impressed by them,â€\\x9d noted Wenger. â€œI think a team has always a charisma. If you look at the team as a unit, it is like a person. From the vibes coming out you can sense if there is something in there or not.â€\\x9d He feels there is more in there now than with the younger teams he had in recent years. â€œIn my job if you donâ€™t believe in your team you are in a bad shape,â€\\x9d he says. â€œI think they are more experienced now. When we moved into the stadium here, on the day we could play everybody off the park but, when you had to dig deep, come out with your knowledge and your experience, it was a bit more difficult.â€\\x9d With the exception of HÃ©ctor BellerÃ\\xadn (aged 20) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (22) the average age of the rest of Arsenalâ€™s starting XI against Newcastle was 29. They needed plenty of collective knowhow to withstand some exciting moments from Newcastle, who broke with verve at times, before finding their decisive goal. There was promising movement and a cluster of chances were created when the attacking trio of Moussa Sissoko, Georginio Wijnaldum and Ayoze PÃ©rez roaming behind Aleksandar Mitrovic got into their stride. Newcastle have to cling to the positive signs but at some stage soon they need to add a ruthless edge. Steve McClaren put on a brave face afterwards but it was not easy to take another harsh example of how performances do not always get rewarded in the hard currency of Premier League points. â€œWe just have got to keep performing like that and keep believing, even though we keep getting knock-backs, especially in the last three games,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI cannot fault the players or their attitudes. The last three games we have lost 1-0 and had good chances to score first but weâ€™ve not. That is why we have lost them. If we had had Olivier Giroud, I think we would have comfortably won the game. â€œThatâ€™s the difference in football and everybody is always searching for that. Papiss CissÃ©, who is a goalscorer, is out for the next two or three months. We have got other goalscorers â€“ we have just got to step to the plate and start scoring. Doing our job.â€\\x9d Newcastle are actively searching for striking reinforcements in the winter transfer window. â€œWe have been working behind the scenes. We will do tirelessly,â€\\x9d added McClaren. Rather like Wenger â€“ albeit in rather different circumstances â€“ McClaren is counting on the spirit he likes the look of to carry his team in the right direction.

              "  'Consumer watchdog warns against 2018 deadline for PPI claims The City regulatorâ€™s plan to set a 2018 deadline for payment protection insurance claims is â€œill-judgedâ€\\x9d and would set a dangerous precedent, according to consumer body Which? Last year the Financial Conduct Authority set out plans to impose a two-year time limit on PPI claims, drawing a line under the financial industryâ€™s costliest mis-selling scandal. By the end of 2015 the total amount set aside by the big five banks for PPI compensation had reached Â£32bn, with more than Â£3bn paid out to customers last year alone, prompting Which? to claim that the scandal â€œis far from overâ€\\x9d. The FCA said it would run an advertising campaign to encourage customers to bring forward any remaining claims. But Which? said a two-year time limit would â€œresult in banks having little incentive to pay out compensation swiftly and directly to consumers in any future mis-selling scandalsâ€\\x9d. The consumer body added: â€œIt is clear that banks should do more to make their processes for handling PPI complaints simpler and fairer.â€\\x9d The consumer body said that before the FCA goes ahead with any proposals for a time limit, it should bring in a simpler process for making a claim, with banks required to accept complaints electronically. It should also tighten up the regulation of claims management companies, making directors personally accountable if firms break the rules relating to nuisance calls. The FCA also called for the publication of more information about how firms have handled claims to date, the amount of redress outstanding, and how the FCA will judge the time limit to be a success.',\n",
              "  'Mark Noble counts his spot luck as West Ham see off bullish Burnley The demeanour was no less hangdog, but Slaven Bilicâ€™s words were upbeat at last as he was able to celebrate a rare home Premier League victory. Mark Nobleâ€™s first-half goal, tucking away the rebound of his own saved penalty, earned West Ham three points in an unremarkable but unrelenting encounter with Burnley in which the home side dominated the first half only for the visitors to spring back in the second. â€œItâ€™s a very important and a very hard-fought three points,â€\\x9d Bilic said after the match. â€œIt was a very long game. I think we deserved it. There were two different halves. In the first it was all us, we hit the post twice and we had many shots. Not many clear-cut chances but we controlled the game. We had two penalty appeals, one was given, and I think we should have been two up.â€\\x9d His summary was spot on. West Ham recorded 72% possession in the first half but, even with Andy Carroll restored to the starting lineup, failed to open up a resolute Burnley backline. That was not necessarily a disaster for a team with West Hamâ€™s skill set, however, so well stocked are they with long-range shooters, and both Pedro Obiang and Noble duly hit the woodwork from distance before half-time. The goal came in injury time in the first half and from a Dimitri Payet corner, after the Frenchman, who lasted the full 90 mintues, found Carroll with his cross. The forwardâ€™s header went straight towards Tom Heaton, but the Burnley keeper seemed to be impeded by Michail Antonio and could not get to the ball. Instead it bounced back into the path of Winston Reid and, unwilling to give him a shooting opportunity, Ben Mee pulled the New Zealander to the ground. The referee, Robert Madley, awarded the penalty and Noble turned it in at the second attempt after his first was well saved by Heaton. For Sean Dyche it was a goal that should never have been given. â€œIt was a clear foul on Tom Heaton,â€\\x9d said the Burnley manager of Antonioâ€™s block. â€œItâ€™s very frustrating. Every other keeper goes on his back, flails around on the floor and itâ€™s given. Because ours do it the proper way â€¦ now weâ€™re called naive. You know, it used to be applauded when you played the game properly.â€\\x9d After a digression into the history of challenges on goalkeepers â€“ â€œItâ€™s not 1972 any more, not that Iâ€™m old enough to remember thatâ€\\x9d â€“ Dyche went on to praise his side for their second-half improvement and declared himself disappointed not to be leaving with a point. â€œWe had three big, big chances in the second half,â€\\x9d Dyche said. â€œSam Vokes should have scored from a header, Andre Gray was an inch away from connecting in the six-yard box and Michael Keane had a chance from a set play. The clarity came back in the second half. We work hard, try to win every game and thereâ€™s been some good signs [in our away form].â€\\x9d Next up for Burnley are Spurs at White Hart Lane on Sunday. West Ham, meanwhile, welcome Hull City to the London Stadium and, after Wednesday night, the chance to secure back-to-back wins. But after speaking last week of his sideâ€™s need for a â€œclean sheet mentalityâ€\\x9d, Bilic believes his team must also shake off the mental â€œcrampâ€\\x9d that afflicted them in the second half here. â€œI praised the players: the spirit, the mentality the clean sheet, all of that,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut I saw the cramp, the fear of winning. That cramp can only go away with climbing up the table but we managed it today and hopefully this should put us in a position that on Saturday we go in with less of that cramp and more confidence.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Could Margot Robbie's all-female superhero movie be DC's trump card? Angry Comics Guy is no newcomer to geek culture. You may have met him in an online forum, berating female cosplayers for dressing â€œsluttilyâ€\\x9d while defending the right of comic book artists to paint female superheroes with overly sexualised body shapes. He might be hanging around the comments section of an article on the latest X-Men movie, pointing out the differences between the film adaptation and its original print incarnation. But the version of Angry Comics Guy whoâ€™s been most prominent in recent weeks has been the DC Comics fan who simply refuses to accept the many failings of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The critics are being paid to promote movies from rival studio Marvel, he cries. Zack Snyder has been unfairly dismissed because his peculiar brand of violent, visceral (yet strangely humourless) film-making does not fit the mediaâ€™s view of how comic book movies should look in the post-Avengers era. Marvelâ€™s own take on the superhero smackdown movie, Captain America: Civil War, has been unfairly painted as a masterpiece when itâ€™s really just over-hyped trash. The good news is that Angry Comics Guy (DC fan version) may soon have good reason to stop getting so upset. Because for every Warner Bros-produced movie that looks a bit like Batman v Superman, there seems to be one that looks a whole lot more like David Ayerâ€™s hugely anticipated Suicide Squad. And if you believe a new story from the Hollywood Reporter, itâ€™s only going to get better. According to the site, Margot Robbie is keen to follow up her debut as Harley Quinn in the comic book ensemble with her own outing as the Jokerâ€™s colourful paramour, backed by a plethora of female heroes and villains from the DC universe such as Batgirl, Birds of Prey, Poison Ivy, Katana and Bumblebee. Why is this such a big win for DC fans? For a start, itâ€™s a sign that Warner might be waking up to the real strength of the DC back catalogue, to titles born in the 90s rather than the 40s and 50s, to the female-focused stories of the hugely popular DC SuperHero Girls line rather than endlessly regurgitated Batman and Superman tales. This, after all, is an area where DC has shown itself to be ahead of the curve in print, via groundbreaking series such as the 2011 reintroduction of Batgirl as a post-paraplegic Barbara Gordon. The news also comes on the same day that Iron Man 3 director Shane Black accused unnamed Marvel bosses of refusing him permission to use a female villain in the Robert Downey Jr blockbuster for fear of losing out on toy sales. Itâ€™s a strange story, because the character who ended up as the bad guy â€“ Aldrich Killian, played by Guy Pearce â€“ is pretty much unavailable as a toy. Perhaps Marvel at one point hoped to sell Mandarin playthings, since Killian ends up being exposed as Iron Manâ€™s traditional nemesis in the movie, but the decision still seems bizarre on all counts. On the other hand, this is the same company that swapped out Scarlett Johanssonâ€™s Black Widow for Captain America when selling toys based on a key motorbike scene in last yearâ€™s Avengers: Age of Ultron. Black makes it clear in his comments that the Marvel executive responsible for defeminizing Iron Man 3 (Rebecca Hallâ€™s Maya Hansen is also said to have lost lines) was not Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. But the revelations will still heap pressure on the Disney-owned unit to prove it doesnâ€™t have a problem with women. So far, the only female-led superhero movie on Marvelâ€™s forthcoming slate is 2019â€™s Captain Marvel. Still, no director has been named, and the studio hasnâ€™t yet announced who will play the hero otherwise known as Carol Danvers. Only last week, Feige hinted that a Johansson-led Black Widow movie is top of the studioâ€™s wishlist. Yet Marvel has greenlit eight movies led by male superheroes for debut between now and 2020, so why the holdup on confirming concrete plans for one of its more popular costumed titans? Meanwhile, it looks like Warnerâ€™s DC-based universe might be ready to steal a march. The studio recently wrapped on Patty Jenkinsâ€™ Wonder Woman, with Israeli actor Gal Gadot reprising her popular turn from Dawn of Justice, and now looks set to make Robbieâ€™s sweetly poisonous Quinn the mainstay of future films before weâ€™ve even seen more than a few clips from Suicide Squad. Letâ€™s hope Warner has seen Ayerâ€™s movie and knows it has a hit on its hands â€“ though that was also the ultimately failed theory about Batman v Superman. The veteran geek blogger Drew McWeeny recently published a powerful cri de coeur calling on Marvel and DC Comics fans to stop their petty squabbling and learn to enjoy the sheer breadth of comic book stories currently making their way to the big screen. From this perspective, elevating Quinn to centre stage in the DC â€™verse is surely just as exciting a development as Ryan Reynoldsâ€™ Deadpool smashing R-rated records for 20th Century Fox, or Tom Hollandâ€™s Spider-Man stealing scenes like a boss in Civil War. The future is looking both bright and diverse, and DC suddenly looks ready to lead the way by stepping into uncharted territory where its rivals fear to tread. Surely even Angry Comics Guy ought to be happy about that.\",\n",
              "  \"New test 'detects genes for every known inherited heart condition' A blood test has been created that can detect all known inherited heart condition genes, boosting the prospects of diagnosing potentially fatal defects, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said. By identifying 174 genes related to 17 inherited heart defects, which affect more than half a million people in the UK and are often the cause of unexplained sudden deaths, the assessment should help people obtain appropriate treatment. The research, published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Translational Research on Friday, has already led to the test being introduced at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS foundation trust â€“ where about 40 patients a month are being assessed for an inherited heart condition (IHC). The hope is that it will eventually be adopted by NHS labs across the country. Dr James Ware, one of the lead researchers on the study at Imperial College London and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, said: â€œItâ€™s really hard to overstate the importance of genetic testing when youâ€™re managing a family with IHCs. â€œI often will find a young father or mother having recently lost their partner to an IHC and worried that their children will be next. Ware, who also a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital, added: â€œThereâ€™s almost no way I can prove their children donâ€™t have the condition because even if they donâ€™t now they could develop it later. But if you can do a genetic test it becomes very easy to say â€˜youâ€™re at riskâ€™ or â€˜youâ€™re absolutely clearâ€™.â€\\x9d The research, funded by the BHF and the Health Innovation Challenge Fund grant â€“ a partnership between the Department of Health and the Wellcome Trust â€“ was the result of an international collaboration between UK and Singaporean researchers. The test is cheaper and more effective than existing assessments, which look at a smaller number of genes and only identify specific conditions. Ware said it also has the benefit of being â€œoff the shelfâ€\\x9d so that other experts can develop it. This means that as other genes are identified as being linked to IHCs, they too can be incorporated into the test. IHCs affect the heart and circulatory system, are passed down through families and can affect people of any age. Last year, Sir David Frostâ€™s son Miles died, aged 31, having not been told he was at risk from the congenital heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), believed to be inherited from his father. Last month his family launched a fund in Milesâ€™s memory, aiming to to raise Â£1.5m to ensure that genetic testing for immediate family members of those affected by HCM is available nationwide. Diagnosing the exact condition and gene causing an IHC are key to effective treatment. If effective, genetic testing on family members can identify those who carry the faulty gene and steps can be taken to reduce the risk of sudden death, such as surgery, medication â€“ for example beta blockers â€“ or lifestyle changes. Prof Peter Weissberg, medical director at the BHF, said: â€œIn this rapidly evolving field of research the aim is to achieve ever greater diagnostic accuracy at ever-reducing cost. â€œThis research represents an important step along this path. It means that a single test may be able to identify the causative gene mutation in someone with an inherited heart condition thereby allowing their relatives to be easily tested for the same gene.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Tech must offer hope to all, not a privileged few In July President Barack Obama addressed the national convention of the Democratic Party and ended perhaps the last great speech of his tenure by returning to the theme of â€œthe audacity of hopeâ€\\x9d. Stark dividing lines have been drawn in the US election contest between hope and fear, between a yearning for simpler times and a belief that the best is yet to come. It is not hard to draw a parallel with some of Britainâ€™s own political challenges; the tension between those excited by a more global and connected future and those who fear being left behind in this brave new world. Much has been written about how to make globalisation work for all, and a solution remains elusive. A challenge we can meaningfully wrestle with as an industry is how we make an increasingly connected society work for the many, making technology a source of hope, not a source of anxiety and exclusion. The internet has arguably been one of the most powerful forces for democratisation the world has ever known, giving a voice and opening a market to many who were previously disenfranchised. Platforms from TXTBKS, which provides old sim cards into condensed text books for underprivileged schoolchildren to crisis-mapping software Ushahidi show the potential of the simplest technologies to make major differences. Yet within our own society we have been slow to make innovation relevant and accessible to those most apprehensive about or underserved by new technologies, to tackle real, everyday problems such as access to credit, access to a GP within an overloaded NHS, or access to meaningful roles within a fast-changing labour market. The fintech industry for example can often seem preoccupied with wooing millennials with slick data visualisations and effortless mobile transactions. Yet 1.5 million adults in the UK do not have access to a bank account â€“ while 1.8 million a year access payday loans in the absence of more affordable credit. With high street branches closing at ever faster rates, the digital banking revolution can exclude those most in need of assistance. Yet the technology exists to make access to banking services and credit possible without access to a traditional bank account. Services such as Kenyaâ€™s MPesa enable any user with access to a mobile phone to deposit and transfer funds, no bank account required. Meanwhile almost half of finance executives surveyed believe blockchain technology will mean â€œthe end of banking as we know itâ€\\x9d, creating entirely new models for the transfer of funds. How then can we apply these technologies to providing accessible and affordable credit to those in immediate need, or to ensuring urgent benefit payments are as swiftly available as possible? In the realm of healthcare, private enterprises in the US are applying the Uber model to medicine via apps such as Heal and Pager which identify the nearest doctor, their ratings and reputation and their price for a real-time consultation. Could we apply the same principle to clusters of local surgeries within the NHS, enabling patients to identify the nearest available appointment to them, dynamically updated to take account of changes and cancellations? Once hailed as an empowering force for change, the gig economy has come under fire in recent months over working conditions and the status of workers. Perhaps a more equitable and interesting approach is to ask how traditional infrastructure and traditional roles can be re-purposed â€“ meeting the needs of the on-demand economy in a different way. Pass my Parcel, a venture from distribution firm Smiths News, works with independent local stores to facilitate same day delivery on behalf of Amazon. Retailers receive a small fee for each parcel collected, and increased footfall in store while Amazon receive an increased footprint for same-day delivery services. New technology leveraging traditional infrastructure. In a similar vein, The School in the Cloud takes advantage of dormant skills in retirees to facilitate remote learning among some of the worldâ€™s most underprivileged children, tapping into a resource that might otherwise be unused and undervalued. Yet there is no reason a similar principle cannot be applied more broadly. Imagine the impact on an over-burdened education system of thousands of retired teachers, craftspeople, scientists or writers signing up to provide even an hour or two of virtual tuition a week. In a nutshell, imagine a world where we stop designing products and services with young, urban and affluent populations at the forefront of our minds. They wonâ€™t mind â€“ theyâ€™ve got Pokemon to catch. The opportunity is to design services that are simple, scalable and solve real problems; so how do we make it a reality? The team behind Gov.uk have done an extraordinary job in making it simpler to access government information and services. Is the next phase of that journey to move beyond making existing services accessible and towards developing new service propositions? Or can the private sector lead the way, re-engineering the on-demand economy to be not just egalitarian but genuinely fair for both workers and consumers? Either way, there is a genuine opportunity for the tech community to prove that it is not a â€œliberal eliteâ€\\x9d designing for fellow liberal elites but a community committed to making technology a force for hope, not just a force for change.

              "  \"Health chiefs warn of 'recklessâ€™ cuts in student nurse funding Britainâ€™s major health organisations have called on the government to put a stop to â€œrecklessâ€\\x9d plans to reform student nurse funding in the current climate of uncertainty and NHS staff shortages. Led by the Royal College of Nursing, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Patients Association, a coalition of more than 20 charities, medical and professional bodies and trade unions today releases an open letter to David Cameron saying that moves to drop funding for student nurses and midwives are an â€œuntested gambleâ€\\x9d. Currently open to a 12-week consultation, which closes on 30 June, the proposals include dropping bursaries to support nurses during their training and switching them to student loans â€“ something health experts warn will risk reducing the supply of future nurses, midwives and other health workers when they are desperately needed. They are asking the prime minister to fully consider the impact on patient care in England. Training for nurses had been treated differently to other higher and further education courses precisely to help reverse the shortages. The organisations highlight the â€œworrying lack of clarity or consultation about the effect that funding changes could have on those who need to train for more advanced or specialist roles, such as health visitors or district nursesâ€\\x9d. It comes as an RCN survey points to a dramatic fall in the number of school nurses, with almost a third working unpaid overtime every day to keep up with their workload. In figures released for its national conference this weekend, the RCN said its research showed the number of school nursing posts had fallen by 10% since 2010, leaving 2,700 school nurses now caring for more than nine million pupils, despite a rising incidence in issues, especially in mental health, among children. More than two-thirds (68%) of those surveyed said there were insufficient school nursing services in their area to provide the support that children and young people need, 70% said their workload was too heavy, and 28% work over their contracted hours on a daily basis. More than a third (39%) said they had insufficient resources to do their jobs effectively. An average of at least three children in every classroom now suffer from a mental health problem. Janet Davies, chief executive of the RCN, said: â€œThere are huge variations in care across the country and far too many vulnerable children are not getting the support they need. School nurses have the skills and experience to provide a wide range of mental health support, from counselling to promoting healthy lifestyles. But there are too few, and they are too stretched. All children deserve access to the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Only by investing in school nursing and wider mental health services can this crisis be tackled and children be given the best chance of leading happy and healthy lives.â€\\x9d About 0.7% of NHS funding is spent on young peopleâ€™s mental health, and 23% of young people asking for help are being turned away from local mental health services. A government spokesman said: â€œWe are putting a record Â£1.4bn into transforming the support available to young people in every area of the country. This funding will help recruit more staff and create improved training that school nurses can access. We are working with NHS England to strengthen the links between schools and mental health services through a Â£3m pilot, and are investing Â£1.5m on developing peer-support networks in schools.â€\\x9d The Department of Health said: â€œOur plans mean up to 10,000 more training places by the end of this parliament, with student nurses getting around 25% more financial support while they study.â€\\x9d But health professionals say in their letter that plans to switch to loans â€œcould disproportionately affect more mature students, women, students with children and those who already have a degree, people who have always made up an important part of the NHS workforce. â€œMany will be unwilling or unable to take on even more debt. These plans are a short-sighted attempt to solve a long-term and complicated problem. They have not been properly risk-assessed and continuing with them as they stand would be nothing short of reckless.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  \"Why I've seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens seven times Until recently, the film I had seen most often at the cinema was James Cameronâ€™s Avatar, of which I cranked out six viewings in the sweltering Melbourne summer of 2009 when I was without an air conditioner (and also because I love the film; more on that later). But that record was toppled on Wednesday when I watched JJ Abramsâ€™s Star Wars: The Force Awakens for the seventh time (I expect Iâ€™ll tap out at eight). Poetically, the following day the ongoing space opera nabbed another, arguably more momentous win over Avatar, as the all-time champion of the US box office. For those keeping track of my viewing habits, so far the tally has consisted of one â€œVmaxâ€\\x9d session (at 12:01am on 17 December â€“ first in the country), three â€œXtreme Screenâ€\\x9d sessions, two Imax viewings and even one in a plain old, ordinary movie theatre. Seeing a film multiple times at the cinema isnâ€™t born of some sort of Starship Troopers-esque â€œIâ€™m doing my partâ€\\x9d approach to fandom, whereby I have to â€œhelpâ€\\x9d the film succeed. (Indeed, Iâ€™m fairly certain The Force Awakens will be OK even if Iâ€™d seen it a sum total of none times.) Itâ€™s more about taking the time to fully appreciate a film on every level. My list of most-seen films isnâ€™t necessarily heavy on blockbusters, anyway. (To get semantical for a moment, in my books you â€œseeâ€\\x9d a movie at the cinema and you â€œwatchâ€\\x9d a film at home.) Yes, thereâ€™s The Force Awakens (7+) and Avatar (6), but thereâ€™s also Inglourious Basterds (5), American Hustle (4), Pineapple Express (4, three of which were within 48 hours and not in any way fuelled by secret herbs and spices, ahem) and A Prophet (3), among others. My approach varies from film to film, but tends to unfold something like this: the first screening is for the immediate emotional reaction, then I return to take in the plot, unfettered by the stress of wondering whatâ€™s going to happen. (A 2011 study by UC San Diego researchers demonstrated that people enjoyed stories more when they had the endings â€œspoiledâ€\\x9d, so my approach is backed up by hard science, clearly.) Contrary to popular thought, the emotional impact of a film isnâ€™t lessened over multiple screenings; if anything, it starts to emerge in unexpected ways as you sit back and let the film wash over you (again and again). Once Iâ€™m on top of the plot, itâ€™s time to relax and choose a different thing to explore each time: whatâ€™s happening in the background? What are the production design details I missed? If itâ€™s a film I might want to recreate a costume from, what specifics can I pick up about seams, zips, pleats, weathering or fabric? Donâ€™t believe me? Having now seen The Force Awakens more times than itâ€™s had major premiere events, I can tell you that the meal Rey is eating at Maz Kanataâ€™s tavern looks like a halved horned melon stuffed with a romanesco broccoli floret and a sprig of dill, and that Reyâ€™s tabard is pleated, not draped, and tacked in place over the shoulders. Also, Kylo Renâ€™s sleeves have a zipper at the seam. Youâ€™re welcome! Indeed, I stopped wearing my Rey costume to see The Force Awakens after the fourth screening because I was beginning to get horrifically embarrassed about its lack of screen accuracy (in my defence, I did make it for the Melbourne premiere with only the trailers and posters as my guide). Screen accuracy is in the eye of the beholder, however, and it didnâ€™t stop little girls from rushing up to me for photos in the candy bar or whispering â€œitâ€™s Reyâ€\\x9d as they passed me on the escalators. Primarily, however, my tendency to see films a bunch in cinemas is precisely that: because films are made to be seen in cinemas. That might seem a hopelessly old-fashioned statement in an era where we can watch Netflix on our phones, but really: are you totes pumped for The Force Awakens to hit Blu-ray so you can watch it in bed? Was Avatar really better on your iPad? Did Robert Richardsonâ€™s exquisite cinematography sing when you watched Inglourious Basterds on your laptop while having a bath? The answer to all of those, as Iâ€™ve done them all, is â€œYeah, kindaâ€\\x9d, but I do still believe in the sanctity of the cinema and the transformative and transporting nature of movie-going. My preferred cinema experience is 7pm or so on â€œtightarse Tuesdayâ€\\x9d because the crowd isnâ€™t stunned into depressed silence by having to spend $25 per ticket and can instead relax into the film. It reminds me of my time in the United States, where ticket prices are cheaper (at one screening in Lafayette, Los Angeles, the tickets were $5) and going to the movies is still an everyday activity for many. At this weekâ€™s Tuesday session of Joy, during a crucial scene, audience members craned their necks, perched literally on the edge of their seats and whispered â€œNO!â€\\x9d and â€œDonâ€™t do it!â€\\x9d That was my second screening of Joy; Iâ€™ll be going back again to better appreciate Judy Beckerâ€™s production design, which makes every scene look as though itâ€™s happening inside Joyâ€™s shoebox full of dreams. Iâ€™ll let you know if the crowd gets into it again. As for The Force Awakens, well, itâ€™s possible the tally might continue to climb. I might pop back to Imax, get a closer look at that pleating, or duck in for a lunchtime cheap Tuesday session and revel in that first close up of Oscar Isaacâ€™s preposterously handsome face. Really, it all depends on my friends and family. After all, if someone asks you, â€œHey, wanna go see Star Wars?â€\\x9d thereâ€™s only really one correct answer, and it sure as hell isnâ€™t â€œNo thanksâ€\\x9d.\",\n",
              "  \"Amazon Fresh food deliveries 'to start this month in UK' Amazon is believed to be planning to start delivering fresh food in the UK this month, stepping up the pressure on traditional supermarkets. The online retailer is understood to have been testing fresh food deliveries from its depot in east London and to have asked suppliers to begin deliveries in the next few weeks. One supplier of chilled meals, Bol, told trade magazine the Grocer that its salad bowls would be launching on Amazon Fresh on 18 May. Amazon is expected to ramp up its food business after appointing Doug Gurr, the boss of its Chinese business and a former Asda executive, to run its UK operations. Gurr takes over this month from Chris North, who has quit the company. Gurr has extensive experience of running online food businesses. In his four and a half years at Asda, he was responsible for strategy, logistics and online operations. The arrival of Amazon Fresh, which has been operating in the US for about seven years, comes after the online business signed a deal with British supermarket Morrisons. The Bradford-based chain has agreed to wholesale ambient, fresh and frozen products to Amazon despite already operating its own website in partnership with Ocado. Last September Amazon began selling frozen items via its Prime Now one-hour delivery service, which is offered in big cities including London and Manchester. That followed the expansion of the Amazon Pantry service, which enables shoppers to fill a box of grocery items from a range of 4,000 household products, including big brands such as Kelloggâ€™s, Ariel, Colgate and Kronenbourg. Fresh and frozen food is not sold via Pantry. Amazonâ€™s latest move comes as Sainsburyâ€™s finalises its tie-up with Argos, the multi-channel retailer â€“ a move seen as a way to fight off future competition from the online retailer. Analysts are hoping the supermarket will reveal more about its plans for the the Â£1.4bn takeover alongside its annual results on Wednesday. Sainsburyâ€™s has already stepped up its online activity since Mike Coupe took over as chief executive in July 2014. On Tuesday, the company said it planned to double the number of stores where shoppers could collect groceries ordered online from a â€œdrive-throughâ€\\x9d site in the car park. The supermarket launched its click-and-collect groceries service in March 2015 and plans to have 200 sites in a yearâ€™s time, up from 100 at present. Robbie Feather, Sainsburyâ€™s director of online, said: â€œClick and collect is proving to be a popular hybrid between online shopping and visiting a store, especially among shoppers juggling work and looking after young children.â€\\x9d Sainsburyâ€™s is also hiring 150 more digital and technology experts to help improve its online store. The supermarket had already more than doubled its digital and technology staff in the past year, hiring 480 workers as it fends off rising competition from Amazon as well as the UKâ€™s dominant online grocer Tesco.\",\n",

              "  'Jeremy Corbyn turns to grassroots after bruising day ends with Labour in turmoil It was an extraordinarily bruising day but Jeremy Corbyn was just about still standing as Labour leader as he addressed thousands of supporters in Parliament Square on Monday evening. He had just come from a brutal meeting of his parliamentary party, where MP after MP called on him to step down, some shouting and some close to tears. They had trailed into a meeting room in the Palace of Westminster for 6pm on Monday with sombre faces, while a pack of up to 100 journalists waited outside flanked by police and door staff. Corbyn began by calling for party unity and making clear that he would not be standing down. Several of his supporters spoke up to back his formation of a new shadow cabinet, after a wave of 40 resignations from his top team over the course of Sunday and Monday. But then came the onslaught from Labour MPs including many who had never publicly attacked him before. Robert Flello, a low-profile and previously uncritical backbencher, was the first to demand that he go. â€œFor your sake, but most importantly for the people who need a Labour government, do the decent thing,â€\\x9d he said. The calls kept coming, with Clive Efford saying: â€œSearch inside yourself and ask if the electorate really think you are a prime minister because I donâ€™t really think you are.â€\\x9d Another intervention came from Helen Goodman, who said: â€œMuch as I like you on a personal level, you canâ€™t offer leadership.â€\\x9d Chris Matheson was cheered for saying he had won a swing seat from the Tories, unlike Barry Gardiner, the newly appointed shadow energy minister, who was booed for trying to defend Corbyn. MPs also shouted at the leader that he should deal with concerns of Ian Murray, who resigned as shadow Scotland secretary on Sunday. Murray urged the leader to â€œcall off the dogsâ€\\x9d in reference to Momentum members protesting outside his constituency office. Corbyn said he had called out abusive behaviour but MPs shouted: â€œTheyâ€™re outside,â€\\x9d in reference to the gathered crowd. But the biggest cheer of the evening came for Alan Johnsonâ€™s intervention, as the leader of Labourâ€™s remain campaign criticised Corbynâ€™s failure to throw his full weight behind the effort to stay in the EU. Johnson said he took responsibility and Corbyn should share in that. Unmoved by the weight of criticism, Corbyn summed up in front of his furious party, making it clear he intended to carry on with his new team. The meeting broke up for MPs to vote, but afterwards several were openly briefing against Corbyn in the corridor outside about the usually private meeting. Others stormed off saying they were too angry to talk. Bryant said it was a â€œbattle for the soul of the Labour party. The writing on the wall is eight metres high and if he canâ€™t see it he needs to go to Specsavers,â€\\x9d he added. Another Labour MP, Ian Austin, said it was not just the usual suspects calling for Corbyn to go. â€œThe overwhelming number of speakers were critical of Jeremy and saying he should stand down,â€\\x9d he added. â€œIâ€™ve never seen anything like it. Itâ€™s a big moment for the Labour party.â€\\x9d Waiting across the corridor with a briefing of their own were two Labour spokesmen, who acknowledged most of the speakers were hostile but took issue with the idea that the majority of MPs were against him. â€œHe is not going to concede to a corridor coup or backroom deal that tries to pressure him out. It is all about whispering corridors, meeting together and people resigning from the appointed posts,â€\\x9d he said. Tensions were running high as another aide made clear: â€œThere is one way if people want to change the leadership of the Labour party, that is to get the names to stand a candidate and mount a challenge and have an election. Jeremy will be a candidate. This is irrelevant. All the resignations are a sideshow. If people have confidence they can win a leadership election, they can mount that challenge. If they are avoiding that, maybe they donâ€™t have that confidence.â€\\x9d The huddle of aides and journalists only broke up as Corbynâ€™s spokesman, Kevin Slocombe, was confronted by John Woodcock, Labour MP for Barrow and a serial rebel. â€œIt is extraordinary you stand and slag us off to the media, while weâ€™re supposed to have a private meeting. You were saying it in front of all these people, this wonâ€™t be the end of it,â€\\x9d Woodcock said. â€œYou are an unelected official, standing outside, briefing the media, giving a highly distorted account.â€\\x9d It was a dramatic culmination of tensions after the past few days had seen the Labour leader sack his foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, for plotting a coup and 20 further resignations by shadow cabinet ministers who no longer had confidence in him. Corbyn was holding firm against the rebels on Sunday night, saying he would fight as a candidate in any leadership election to replace him. But things were about to get significantly worse. The steady stream of resignations over the course of Monday led one MP to compare Corbynâ€™s task to trying to fill a bath without a plug. Undeterred, the Labour party press office sent out an email early in the morning announcing the promotion of Emily Thornberry to shadow foreign secretary and Diane Abbott to shadow health secretary, plus a raft of other loyalists â€“ many only elected a year ago â€“ to key jobs. Corbyn had just left his home surrounded by journalists and police for a meeting with Tom Watson, the deputy leader, who was widely expected to apply pressure for him to go. This took place at 9am and differing accounts began to emerge. On the leaderâ€™s side, it was described as cordial and calm, with no hint that Corbyn should resign. Watsonâ€™s camp agreed that the deputy leader had stopped short of calling for his head but claimed he had informed Corbyn that the party did not have confidence in his leadership. All eyes were now on a few senior shadow cabinet ministers who had not yet shown their hands but were considered potential leadership challengers. Rumours abounded that Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, was being set up as the rival candidate. But she soon released a joint letter with Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, saying that they were stepping down and calling for Watson to be caretaker leader. They were joined by Nia Griffith, Kate Green, John Healey â€“ all considered on the soft left of the party and previously part of the â€œmake it work brigadeâ€\\x9d who were willing to give Corbynâ€™s leadership a chance. The group had met Corbyn together on Monday morning claiming that they wanted to make it work but felt compelled to resign after it became clear the leader was unable to form an inclusive shadow cabinet. According to one source at the meeting, the MPs were angered that John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, â€œbarged inâ€\\x9d and started answering questions addressed to Corbyn himself. The damage kept coming as Chris Bryant, who had resigned as shadow leader of the House of Commons, revealed that Corbyn had refused to confirm that he voted to remain in the EU, saying it was not the issue at hand. This was dismissed as an attempt to destabilise the party by those close to Corbyn. Within the hour, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary and her sister Maria, the shadow secretary for culture, media and sport, had also gone. Angela then gave a teary interview to the BBCâ€™s World at One programme expressing her sorrow at having to resign in such circumstances. â€œWith deep regret, and after nine months of trying to make it work, I have today resigned from the shadow cabinet,â€\\x9d she said. Corbynâ€™s allies had by now conceded that another leadership election was likely in which he goes head to head with another candidate. But a row over whether he will need nominations from colleagues was brewing, as the rival sides both believe they have legal advice supporting their case. Despite the drama, there was still business to be carried out in the House of Commons but Clive Lewis, the newly appointed shadow defence secretary, was on his way back from Glastonbury festival and Thornberry had to step in to cover her old brief at defence questions. Meanwhile, Luciana Berger, the shadow mental health secretary and candidate to be Labourâ€™s Liverpool mayoral candidate, was the last in a spate of shadow cabinet resignations at 2.18pm, but more junior ones followed from Jack Dromey to Keir Starmer. That left just Rosie Winterton, the chief whip, and Jonathan Ashworth, a shadow cabinet office minister, undeclared about their positions. In the face of continuing turmoil, the Labour leader headed to the House of Commons to tackle Cameron at the despatch box, as the outgoing prime minister explained the timetable for dealing with Brexit. Corbyn spoke to heckles of â€œresignâ€\\x9d from his own side, and taunts from the green benches opposite. Dennis Skinner, the veteran Labour MP for Bolsover, shook the leader of the oppositionâ€™s hand as he entered the chamber and made a â€œVâ€\\x9d sign at other backbenchers. The Labour leader paid no heed to the shouts, except to claim that the â€œcountry will thank neither the benches in front nor those behind for indulging in internal factional manoeuvring at this timeâ€\\x9d. This was the leadershipâ€™s consistent message to the MPs and then again to the huge rally of supporters in Parliament Square. To chants of â€œCorbyn, Corbyn, Corbynâ€\\x9d, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the rally from a stage: â€œLet me make it absolutely clear, Jeremy Corbyn is not resigning.â€\\x9d Corbyn himself appeared just minutes later, telling the crowd he is going nowhere. But on Tuesday he will face a motion of no confidence by secret ballot and any leadership challenger will soon have to come out of the shadows.',\n",
              "  'The inter-generational theft of Brexit and climate change In last weekâ€™s Brexit vote results, there was a tremendous divide between age groups. 73% of voters under the age of 25 voted to remain in the EU, while about 58% over the age of 45 voted to leave. This generational gap is among the many parallels between Brexit and climate change. A 2014 poll found that 74% of Americans under the age of 30 support government policies to cut carbon pollution, as compared to just 58% of respondents over the age of 40, and 52% over the age of 65. Inter-generational theft The problem is of course that younger generations will have to live with the consequences of the decisions we make today for much longer than older generations. Older generations in developed countries prospered as a result of the burning of fossil fuels for seemingly cheap energy. However, weâ€™ve already reached the point where even contrarian economists agree, any further global warming we experience will be detrimental for the global economy. For poorer countries, we passed that point decades ago. A new paper examining climate costs and fossil fuel industry profits for the years 2008â€“2012 found: For all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their CO2 emissions was greater than their afterâ€\\x90tax profit, with the single exception of Exxon Mobil in 2008 For much of the time during which developed nations experienced strong economic growth as a result of fossil fuel consumption, we were unaware of the associated climate costs. We can no longer use ignorance as an excuse. And yet the older generations, who experienced the greatest net benefit from carbon pollution, are now the least supportive of taking responsibility to pay for it. The longer we delay, the more devastating the consequences will be for the younger generations. Similarly, todayâ€™s youth who are early in their career paths will face the harshest consequences of the Brexit vote that was dominated by older voters. As Jack Lennard put it: This is a final middle-fingered salute to the young from the baby boomer generation. Not content with racking up insurmountable debt, not content with destroying any hopes of sustainable property prices or stable career paths, not content with enjoying the benefits of free education and generous pension schemes before burning down the ladder they climbed up, the baby boomers have given one last turd on the doorstep of the younger generation. And as political journalist Nicholas Barrett said in a comment that subsequently went viral: the younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries. We will never know the full extent of the lost opportunities, friendships, marriages and experiences we will be denied. Freedom of movement was taken away by our parents, uncles, and grandparents in a parting blow to a generation that was already drowning in the debts of our predecessors. Thirdly and perhaps most significantly, we now live in a post-factual democracy. A dangerous strain of anti-intellectualism As Barrett noted, during the Brexit campaign, facts seemed useless against the myths propagated by the Leave side. Indeed, Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing UK Independence Party and Leave campaign has already admitted the key claim that Â£350 million weekly saving in EU contributions could be spent on health services was utter nonsense â€“ a â€œmistake,â€\\x9d as he put it. A â€œmistakeâ€\\x9d that was conveniently admitted just hours after Brexit votes had been cast and counted. When asked to name a single economist who backed Brexit, justice secretary and another top Leave campaigner Michael Gove said â€œpeople in this country have had enough of expertsâ€\\x9d and later likened those experts to Nazis. Climate denial is based on a similar strain of anti-intellectualism and preponderance of baseless myths. When faced with the reality of a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, many will deny that reality, propagate a number of associated myths, or like Gove, find an excuse to disregard expert opinion and evidence (e.g. by arguing that scientific consensus â€˜has been wrong beforeâ€™). Ultimately it boils down to ideological biases. When the facts and expert conclusions contradict our beliefs, people will often find an excuse to dismiss the evidence and experts. Itâ€™s perhaps unsurprising that as DeSmogUK revealed, Gove and many other Leave campaign backers are also climate contrarians. Risk management failure - USA must do better Experts warned of the dangerous consequences that would result from Brexit, but the majority of older voters chose to ignore those risks. Prudent risk management was trumped by ideology, and todayâ€™s youth will have to bear the brunt of the consequences. Climate change similarly poses tremendous long-term risks, particularly to younger generations. The UK has thus far been a leader in mitigating those risks, but with the EU exit and potential installment of right-wing climate-denying political leaders, that leadership may be in jeopardy, and the EUâ€™s climate pledges may be compromised. Americans have similarly failed to adequately manage political and climate risks. One of the two dominant US political parties obstructs all efforts to curb carbon pollution, and has also nominated Donald Trump for president: the embodiment of risky behavior. It now falls to the US to do better than the UK. Risk management and the well-being of future generations must trump ideology and fear in the November elections. We simply canâ€™t afford two of the worldâ€™s superpowers being dictated by populism and xenophobia at the expense of our youthâ€™s future.',\n",
              "  'Why would you trust a teen to raise a kid, but not to have an abortion? Dealing with an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy is a difficult experience for anyone. But for teenagers, who have to juggle increasing, and increasingly complicated, financial and legal barriers to abortion access, â€œdifficultâ€\\x9d becomes nearly impossible. And it shouldnâ€™t be. For instance, 21 states require parental consent before a teenager can have an abortion; 13 mandate that at least one parent be notified; and five states mandate both consent and notification. States that require parental notification and consent for a teenager to have a child? Zero. Surely if we believe young people are mature enough to parent or responsible enough to carry a baby to term, and thoughtful enough to make the decision to put a baby up for adoption without parental or judicial intervention (though there are five states that require parental involvement if a minor puts a child up for adoption), they should also have to right to decide whether or not to get a 10-minute medical procedure. But lawmakers insist on enacting more and more roadblocks in between a young woman and her ability to choose what the rest of her life will look like. In Texas, for example, new rules governing judicial bypasses for abortion â€“ which allow young people to get permission for an abortion from a judge rather than a parent â€“ went into effect on January 1. The US supreme court has previously ruled that the judicial bypass procedure must be anonymous and expeditious, but the new law in Texas requires teens to give the judge their names and addresses, and removes judicial deadlines from the process. That means that an anti-choice judge could forgo making a decision on whether to allow or prevent a teenâ€™s abortion as long as necessary to ensure itâ€™s too late for her to even get one. Tina Hester, the executive director of Janeâ€™s Due Process, a Texas nonprofit that provides legal counsel to pregnant teens, said in a statement: â€œjudicial bypass protects vulnerable pregnant teens who cannot find or safely turn to a parent, but the legislature and Governor Abbott decided to go after abused and neglected teens by amending this law.â€\\x9d Indeed, multiple studies show that most minors seeking abortions do tell their parents, and those who donâ€™t want to consult their parents often are in fear of physical harm. Sometimes the teenager is a rape victim; sometimes, itâ€™s even their parent or guardian who got the teenager in question pregnant. When governor Abbott was set to sign the new rules into effect last summer, Hester described in the Houston Chronicle some of the young women her organization has helped: a 17-year old college student whose parents had died in a car accident; a minor who feared her religious father would kill her; young women who would be thrown out of their homes should their pregnancies be revealed at all. Having a process that is speedy, private and reasonable-to-navigate is vital for young people who find themselves pregnant and are already fearful and vulnerable. This is especially true because, as a whole, teenagers are more likely to find out about their pregnancies later on than adults do, and if they are to avoid later abortions â€“ which are riskier and more expensive, and which state legislatures often make more difficult to access â€“ they need to be able to obtain services quickly. It is unreasonable and illogical to expect that teens raise children or give birth and put them up for adoption but not be given the option to consider abortion. The desire for parents to be involved in important decisions in their childrenâ€™s lives is understandable, but parental protectiveness cannot trump a personâ€™s right to her own body and her own future. We should do away with judicial bypasses altogether and let teens decide for themselves whether or not to carry a pregnancy. After all, part of the reason that teens face unwanted pregnancies to begin with is because adults have not served them well: we donâ€™t make birth control accessible and affordable enough for young people, and we teach them ridiculous and false ideas about sex. It is not a coincidence that states that mandate abstinence-only education are also the states with the highest teen pregnancy rates. Policies put in place by adults that know little of their lives do not help young people; allowing them to make informed choices does.',\n",
              "  'Maxwell returns: my working style is â€˜Would Sade or Marvin do this?â€™ â€œI wish I was more presentable,â€\\x9d says Maxwell, packaged loosely in a denim jacket and jeans, in a top-floor room in a Manhattan hotel. â€œIâ€™m post-Prince birthday cake.â€\\x9d The previous night, he was celebrating Princeâ€™s birthday (the first since the pop starâ€™s death in April), marking the life of someone whose work had been crucial to his own musical development. â€œA lot of what he did was why I felt: â€˜Oh, I could be â€¦ maybe not like him, but I donâ€™t have to be this cookie cutter â€¦â€™â€\\x9d His voice trails off. I had seen Maxwell perform just a few days after Princeâ€™s death, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage festival. He would pause between songs to talk about Princeâ€™s influence on his work. â€œEveryone on this stage is here because of him,â€\\x9d he told the crowd. In the middle of his cover of Kate Bushâ€™s This Womanâ€™s Work â€“ which he originally recorded in 2001 â€“ he murmured the opening words from Letâ€™s Go Crazy â€“ â€œDearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called lifeâ€\\x9d â€“ with a religious concentration. â€œIt was such a tough show to get through,â€\\x9d he says now. Two weeks after our interview, Maxwell performs Nothing Compares 2 U at the BET awards; on the night, one of the verses mutates from the Prince original â€“ â€œI went to the record store â€¦ Apple, Spotify, too, and they told me / â€˜Boy youâ€™d better try to make some music, which you canâ€™t do / â€™cause Prince is the truth!â€™â€\\x9d Prince was a fan of Maxwell, too. He had, apparently, been asking Harry Belafonte why Maxwell was taking so long to follow up 2009â€™s BLACKsummersâ€™night album. â€œIâ€™ve known [Prince] for a long time and was shocked that he actually genuinely cared about what I was doing, and why I was taking so long,â€\\x9d Maxwell says. Finally, that new album â€“ blackSUMMERSâ€™night â€“ is out (there will, at some point, be a third album in the series, called blacksummersâ€™NIGHT). But Maxwell does not work quickly. It is 20 years since his debut, Urban Hang Suite, which fitted into the burgeoning neo-soul movement of the time, alongside the crisp debuts of Dâ€™Angelo and Erykah Badu. Two more albums followed in relatively good time: Embrya in 1998, and Now in 2001. And then it was an eight-year wait â€“ during which, he said, he took a break from the music industry to become a â€œfull, 100% manâ€\\x9d â€“ until BLACKsummersâ€™night, followed by another seven for the new album. â€œWhy does it take so damn long? I would say â€¦ anxiety.â€\\x9d Two events paralysed him artistically: turning 40 in 2013, and the success of his previous record. BLACKsummersâ€™night entered the US chart at No 1, while its single Pretty Wings topped the Hot R&B chart for 14 weeks. â€œI didnâ€™t know [BLACKsummersâ€™night] would be so loved. I had no idea. And now I have to put out something else, and it had better be better. And that can freeze you.â€\\x9d He requires the accumulation of experience in order to write, to have gone through something in order to translate it to record. He is also the only person motivating himself to work. â€œI donâ€™t have a creative mafia that makes everything happen,â€\\x9d he says. â€œThatâ€™s not my style, Iâ€™m not interested in that. I wish I was â€“ itâ€™d be nice, I could have a really nice Lamborghini or something. The question begs: â€˜Would Sade do this? Would Marvin do this?â€™â€\\x9d The reference to Sade is pertinent â€“ he has two regular collaborators, Hod David and Stuart Matthewman, and the latter is one of Sadeâ€™s closest colleagues. He is allergic to the elevated atmosphere of celebrity. â€œCelebrities have competitors, and competition, and people they have to fight against or be better than,â€\\x9d he says. â€œArtists, it doesnâ€™t really work that way.â€\\x9d On the cover of the new album, Maxwell obscures his face, as if to diminish his personality and focus attention on his music. â€œMy friend asked me: â€˜Why are you covering your face? Itâ€™s your album! You should be like: Look at me!â€™â€\\x9d he says. Whatâ€™s more evident on the cover, in fact, is the space around Maxwell. â€œYou know what they say. Whatâ€™s hidden is always the most interesting thing,â€\\x9d he says. The new album feels less organic than its predecessor, which emphasised the nimble interactions of its musicians. BlackSUMMERSâ€™night instead explores the tension between live performance and a more hermetic studio process. Maxwell talks about the song Gods, which builds on a four-bar melody, a glistening spine for the song: â€œI donâ€™t know how these things come together,â€\\x9d he says. â€œI really cannot take credit for the writing or any of it. I am writing it, but itâ€™s literally just â€¦ happening.â€\\x9d Like many of Maxwellâ€™s songs, Gods concerns the physical as it flows into the metaphysical: â€œAs you lied so convincingly / As you swore so religiously,â€\\x9d he sings, his voice evolving from its weathered and cracked register into a gentle shimmer: â€œYou played the game of gods.â€\\x9d Two encounters dictated the song. â€œI was going through a really weird experience that involved this girl and this one particular individual that was upset about this girl who was interested in me,â€\\x9d he says. â€œItâ€™s so funny â€“ one thing will begin a song, and then another meeting will completely finish the song. So itâ€™s like an arc of how everybody plays into this particular idea of the song.â€\\x9d And that is how Maxwell songs function: things arc into each other. â€œYou want to say the right things. You want to say things you havenâ€™t heard before, that people havenâ€™t written before. How many times can you say: â€˜I love you babyâ€™?â€\\x9d Maxwell has made an album about a love that may never be understood or reciprocated. â€œIt may happen, it may not,â€\\x9d he says. â€œKind of a wait-and-see, Saturnial, pessimistic. I think it lives in both worlds because of how I think of things. There are no real guarantees. People are independent individuals.â€\\x9d He says heâ€™s a classic romantic, and finds the modern mutations of dating â€“ Tinder, OkCupid, and so on â€“ alienating and uninhabitable. â€œItâ€™s very disconnected and detached,â€\\x9d he says. â€œIâ€™m not hating. Iâ€™m sure people have had amazing moments with their more controlled experience of the things they want to do. People are scared to be vulnerable and surrender themselves to someone else, and thatâ€™s really part of loving someone. I donâ€™t know if what people are writing any more supports that.â€\\x9d At the centre of Maxwellâ€™s music is his vulnerability. â€œIâ€™m always looking for the spark of experience that then goes into the performance,â€\\x9d he says. â€œThatâ€™s what Kate Bush did to me. I didnâ€™t really understand what the hell [This Womanâ€™s Work] was about. I just knew that whatever she felt, whatever her feeling was that she had been through or gone through â€¦ I donâ€™t care who you are when you hear that, itâ€™s buckle-your-knees, fall-to-the-ground, itâ€™s just beautiful. And itâ€™s transcendental. Itâ€™s literally like stuff that you could expect to hear when walking into heaven after you die. Thatâ€™s the thing that Prince had, too.â€\\x9d Now blackSUMMERSâ€™night is done, the main feeling he has is relief. â€œIâ€™m so happy itâ€™s done,â€\\x9d he says. â€œIâ€™m over this.â€\\x9d He says he has finished writing the third part of the trilogy and is in the process of recording it. And where will he be when itâ€™s done? â€œI get to figure out where I want to go, where I want to live, what I want to build,â€\\x9d he says. â€œFamily stuff. Finally, just get a life. Iâ€™ve been living life, but really getting a life finally, extending myself past my own self and the music that Iâ€™m so anxiety-ridden about having to do.â€\\x9d â€¢ blackSUMMERSâ€™night is out now on Sony/RCA.',\n",
              "  'Goldman Sachs to pay $5bn for its role in the 2008 financial crisis Goldman Sachs will pay $5.06bn for its role in the 2008 financial crisis, the US Department of Justice said on Monday. The settlement, over the sale of mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007, was first announced in January. â€œThis resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,â€\\x9d acting associate attorney general Stuart Delery said in a statement. In January, Goldman said it expected the agreement to reduce its earnings for the fourth quarter by about $1.5bn after tax. According to the Wall Street bank, the settlement will consist of a $2.385bn civil monetary penalty, $875m in cash payments, and $1.8bn in consumer relief. Among other measures, the bank will offer a reduction in unpaid principal for affected homeowners and borrowers. â€œWe are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle to resolve these matters,â€\\x9d Lloyd C Blankfein, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in January. This is only the latest multibillion-dollar civil settlement reached with a major bank over the economic meltdown in which millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which earlier this year agreed to pay $3.2bn, are two of the last big banks to pay up. Bank of America agreed to pay the largest of the settlements, $16.6bn, in 2014. A year earlier, JPMorgan Chase paid about $13bn. Such settlements have been worked out by the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, which is co-chaired by New Yorkâ€™s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. New Yorkers will receive about $670m of the Goldman Sachs settlement, including $190m in cash and $480m in consumer relief such as mortgage assistance and principal forgiveness. â€œSince 2012, my No1 priority has been getting New Yorkers the resources they need to rebuild,â€\\x9d Schneiderman said on Monday. â€œThis settlement, like those before it, ensures that these critical programs â€¦ will continue to get funded well into the future, and will be paid for by the institutions responsible for the financial crisis.â€\\x9d The deal, however, includes no criminal sanctions or penalties and is likely to stir additional criticism about the Justice Departmentâ€™s inability to hold bank executives personally responsible for the financial crisis.',\n",

MacKenzie, a former editor of the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, wrote on Monday that the â€œsurgeâ€\\x9d of power he had felt from voting leave had given way to worries about the impact the vote would have on the UKâ€™s future. â€œFour days later I donâ€™t feel quite the same,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI have buyerâ€™s remorse. A sense of be careful what you wish for. To be truthful I am fearful of what lies ahead.â€\\x9d However, in his column on Friday, MacKenzie included an email from Campbell in which Tony Blairâ€™s former spin doctor attacked his earlier backing for the leave campaign and the â€œgiant propaganda machineâ€\\x9d he said MacKenzie had been part of. According to MacKenzie, Campbellâ€™s email read: â€œNever mind buyers remorse, you should feel fucking ashamed to have been for so long part of a giant propaganda machine which has helped the country make a potentially self-destructive decision that future generations will have to live with when you and I are long gone.â€\\x9d â€œMurdoch has been a complete poison in our national life and you have helped so much.

In his column, MacKenzie hit back at Campbell, citing his involvement in the notorious document claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.

              "  'Mark Carney â€‹may end speculation about future â€‹this week Mark Carney could announce a decision about his future as governor of the Bank of England as soon as Thursday, amid a barrage of criticism from Eurosceptic MPs about his approach to Brexit. It is understood that the governor is considering making an announcement on Thursday at a press conference for the Bankâ€™s third-quarter inflation report, given the speculation about his future. However, sources said Carney was equally likely to delay the announcement until later in November and would take the decision based on his personal circumstances. George Osborne, the former chancellor, played a key role in recruiting Carney for the move from Canada to the UK in 2013. According to an article in the Financial Times (Â£) on Sunday, the governor has â€œtold friendsâ€\\x9d that he is ready to serve his full eight-year term. The governor said last week he would make a decision by the end of this year about whether to stay on for his full eight-year term or take advantage of terms allowing him to leave after five years, in 2018. â€œTo be clear, itâ€™s an entirely personal decision and no one should read anything into that decision in terms of government policy. It is a privilege for me to have this role,â€\\x9d he told a parliamentary committee last week. â€œLike everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This role demands total attention and I intend to give it as long as I can.â€\\x9d Theresa May prompted questions about whether there has been a rift between Carney and the Downing Street after she criticised the impact of quantitative easing in her Conservative party conference speech, saying â€œpeople with assets had got richer, people without them had sufferedâ€\\x9d. Both sides have played down any suggestion of divisions since then, and the pair have recently talked on the phone. Greg Clark, the business secretary, told BBC1â€™s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Carney had done a â€œtremendous jobâ€\\x9d for the UK economy. However, there has also been a campaign against the governor by leading Tory Eurosceptics who were annoyed by his pre-referendum predictions about the possible impact of Brexit on the UK economy, which they claim have not come to pass. Those calling for him to go early include Lord Lawson, the former chancellor; Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the public administration committee; Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the Treasury committee; and Daniel Hannan, a leading MEP. Before the vote, Carney suggested campaigners in favour of leaving the EU were â€œin denialâ€\\x9d about some of the economic risks, although he has sounded more positive about the UKâ€™s prospects since the referendum. The former foreign secretary, William Hague, warned earlier this month that central bankers could lose their independence if they ignored public anger over low interest rates, while Michael Gove, the leading pro-leave campaigner and former cabinet minister, compared Carney to the Chinese emperor Ming, whose â€œperson was held to be inviolable and without imperfectionsâ€\\x9d and whose critics were flayed alive. Two former members of the Bank of England monetary policy committee have rallied to Carneyâ€™s defence. Andrew Sentance, who served from 2006 to 2011, told the that the story had been â€œhyped up following Theresa Mayâ€™s comments and articles by William Hague and Michael Goveâ€\\x9d. â€œIf the question is whether Mark Carney is going to stay beyond 2018, when he was appointed he wasnâ€™t going to stay beyond 2018. If he makes a clear decision then it gives the government plenty of time to appoint a successor. â€œI think he has been targeted a bit unfairly by the pro-leave Brexit campaign. The consequences of Brexit are going to play out over a number of years and to say the economy hasnâ€™t collapsed after Brexit means Mark Carney got it badly wrong is unfair. â€œHe made it clear that he thought leaving the EU would be negative for the UK and the timescale over which that plays out depends on how that unfolds, but to jump to the conclusion within a few months when nothing has greatly changed â€“ we are still in the EU â€“ I think some of the criticisms of him from Brexiteers, as you might call them, have been unfair.â€\\x9d David Blanchflower, who was on the committee from 2006 to 2009, said on Twitter that it was â€œludicrous for Brexiters to force Carneyâ€\\x9d, as it would only hurt the UK economy.',\n",
              "  'Look into my eyes: Leave.EU campaign consulted TV hypnotist The leave campaign enlisted the TV hypnotist Paul McKenna to advise on some of its campaign broadcasts, it has emerged. The 53-year old author of bestselling self-help books including The Power to Influence, I Can Make You Happy and Hypnotic Gastric Band was asked by the Ukip-backed Leave.EU campaign to examine early edits of promotional videos. A source at the victorious campaign group told the that McKenna â€œunderstands the psychology of the mindâ€\\x9d and helped Leave.EU â€œproduce social media ads that resonated with peopleâ€\\x9d. But he added: â€œWe didnâ€™t hypnotise anyone.â€\\x9d McKennaâ€™s role emerged at the end of a week in which several senior politicians backtracked on persuasive campaign messages from the EU referendum on immigration controls and how much money saved from payments to the EU could be redirected to the NHS. The hypnotist is said to be a friend of Arron Banks, the Bristol-based multimillionaire insurance businessman who bankrolled the Leave.EU campaign with a Â£5.6m donation. McKenna became involved as Leave.EU spent millions of pounds building up its online following partly by using short, dramatic campaign videos posted on its social media accounts. It claimed that it had 1 million followers and supporters on social media by polling day on 23 June. â€œThat was the key to winning wavering voters,â€\\x9d said Banks. â€œIt was the massive connection through social media.â€\\x9d McKenna declined to comment in detail on what help he gave Leave.EU, but his spokesman said: â€œHe is friendly with Arron Banks and Banks showed him a few rough cuts of promotional videos they were considering using in their campaign. [Paul] was quite intrigued by the new style of political campaigning, which he thought was influenced heavily by American politics.â€\\x9d McKenna has previously described modern hypnotism as â€œgiving you greater communication capabilities with somebodyâ€\\x9d. He has said: â€œMore important than power for me is the feeling of euphoria I get if I help somebody make a change, particularly if it is one that has dramatically impaired their life.â€\\x9d One of the videos McKenna is said to have assessed was a portentous 30-second broadcast on the Leave.EU Facebook page that attracted more than 1.6m views during the campaign. Over doom-laden music, it began by asking: â€œAre you concerned about the amount of crime being committed in the UK by foreign criminals?â€\\x9d and â€œAre you worried about the overcrowding of the UK and the burden on the NHS?â€\\x9d before switching to more upbeat music and asking: â€œIsnâ€™t it time to take back control?â€\\x9d McKenna has also said that being absorbed and engrossed in TV broadcasts is equally as hypnotic as a hypnotically induced trance. This week Banks revealed that a central plank of the leave campaignâ€™s successful strategy emerged from advice taken from the US election strategists Goddard Gunster that â€œfacts donâ€™t workâ€\\x9d. He said: â€œThe remain campaign featured fact, fact, fact, fact, fact. It just doesnâ€™t work. You have got to connect with people emotionally. Itâ€™s the Trump success.â€\\x9d Several commentators have said the Republican candidate for the US presidency, Donald Trump, uses hypnotic techniques in his speeches. He uses repetition to make simple ideas stick. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader and Leave.EU supporter, did something similar during the EU referendum campaign, repeating again and again the mantra â€œtake back controlâ€\\x9d.',\n",
              "  'Hold off applying for passport, Ireland tells Britons The Irish government has urged Britons to take some time to think before applying for an Irish passport as it warned that a surge in applications threatened to place major pressure on the system for processing them. A spike in interest in Irish passports has occurred in Northern Ireland, Britain and elsewhere in the past few days, according to Irelandâ€™s foreign minister, Charlie Flanagan, who said there was no urgency for UK citizens to apply. While the numbers of people turning up to the office in London that processes applications for Irish passports had reduced on Monday, British citizens motivated by last weekâ€™s referendum vote were still turning up on Tuesday. They ranged from one woman who said that she and her family had voted in favour of Britain leaving the EU, but now feared for the economic consequences, to others who had voted to stay. Among the latter was Dominic Allen, who told the that he had been visiting London on business but had decided to also collect a bunch of Irish passport applications for his family. â€œWe have been meaning for a while to reconnect with our Irish roots so Brexit has sort of forced the issue,â€\\x9d said Allen, originally from West Yorkshire but working in Norfolk. He also cited concerns the potential usefulness of the Irish passport in terms of travelling around Europe in future. Similar thoughts were on the mind of Oscar Brennan, 17, who came out of the office in South Kensington with an application form tucked under his arm. â€œIâ€™ve always had it in the back of my mind to do this because I have always felt a strong connection to Ireland through my parents,â€\\x9d he said. Again, the Brexit vote had prompted him into acting. â€œIn terms of job prospects you just donâ€™t know what the future is going to hold, so itâ€™s better to be safe than sorry and be equipped to work in Europe.â€\\x9d Meanwhile an Irish minister and one of the frontrunners to succeed Enda Kenny as taoiseach has urged Ireland to puts its own interest before the UKâ€™s in the post-Brexit negotiations between EU states and the British. In a debate on Brexitâ€™s implications for the republic, the minister for social protection, Leo Varadkar, said: â€œOn some occasions, perhaps most, our interests are aligned with those of the United Kingdom but where they are not, it is not our duty to fight Englandâ€™s battles for her. We must put the interests of Ireland first in the coming years and in the negotiation process. But Varadkar promised to protect pensioners on both sides of the Irish Sea, both British people living in the republic and Irish citizens residing in the UK. He said: â€œTheir pension and employment rights and their social insurance protections and obligations remain unchanged today and will remain unchanged until such time as there is a new agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom and between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'This weekâ€™s new live music The Maccabees, On tour Thereâ€™s a case for the Maccabees being the English Kings Of Leon; not in sound, but in how the current, arena-filling proposition is almost completely unrecognisable from the quirky indie rock band they started out as. Having found huge success with progressively epic and seriously intentioned music, the bandâ€™s 2015 album Marks To Prove It debuted at No 1 in the charts. Interestingly, though, this landmark was achieved with a record that recovers some of the Maccabeesâ€™ original eccentricities. Of course, the windswept Arcade Fire-like characteristics remain, but some of the antic structure of their earlier records makes a welcome return. Barrowland, Fri; touring to 23 Jan JR Daughter, On tour Less is more with Daughter. A trio based around the talents of singer-songwriter Elena Tonra, the group have previously exercised a minimalism in all things, from the stripped-down nature of their arrangements to the manner in which they conceal their strong emotional content beneath a mainly placid delivery. But having shown promise as a kind of folky version of the xx, to judge from the singles from forthcoming second album Not To Disappear the mask is slipping. What seems to be emerging is a rather more melodramatic and rockier beast, wherein the band work less by implication, more by wearing their hearts on their sleeves. Cambridge Corn Exchange, Fri; touring to 28 Jan JR Angel Haze, On tour An MC with no absence of attitude, Angel Haze has found it difficult to walk quite as hard as she has historically talked. All round, this combative confidence has brought her as much bad as it has good. Professionally, her Classick mixtape of three years ago found her confronting the horrible circumstances of her early life on top of some of hip-hopâ€™s legendary beats. About the same time, she entered into a social media war with Azealia Banks, a rather distracting and unproductive move that served to invite unhelpful comparisons between the pair. As it turned out, Hazeâ€™s raw delivery and aggressive stance was an unsuccessful fit with the mainstream, but now she is back among the independents, where her underdog determination may find a more favourable environment in which to develop.

There have been hints about what we can expect from the upcoming Rattle era, and some of the performers with whom he will work. Itâ€™s already clear, for instance, that the great pianist Krystian Zimerman is likely to be a regular visitor, while another of Rattleâ€™s collaborators, the director Peter Sellars, is involved in the semi-staging of PellÃ©as Et MÃ©lisande that Rattle is conducting this weekend. Rattle and Sellars have worked on Debussyâ€™s opera together before, for an impressive full performance in Amsterdam in the 1990s, but this will be a production designed for the concert hall, similar to that the pair have already undertaken with Bachâ€™s Passions.

The actor, who won the award for best actress in a musical or comedy for Joy, was being asked a question by an international journalist when she reprimanded him for reading from his phone. â€œYou canâ€™t live your whole life behind your phone, bro,â€\\x9d Lawrence said. â€œYou just canâ€™t do that. You gotta live in the now.â€\\x9d When the reporter, whose first language doesnâ€™t appear to be English, continued to ask his question about how Lawrence sees herself for the Oscars, she snapped back: â€œWeâ€™re at the Golden Globes. If you put your phone down, youâ€™d know that.â€\\x9d Many have criticised the actor for being culturally insensitive for her words. Superhero Feed tweeted â€œMany reporters read questions off their phone. Especially reporters whoâ€™s first language wasnâ€™t English.â€\\x9d Fans were equally unimpressed: Earlier in the night, the actor presented an award with Amy Schumer, with whom she has written a new comedy. As the two arrived on stage, they criticised someone in the front row for their phone usage. â€œPlease turn your phone off,â€\\x9d Schumer said.

              "  'One Nation senator joins new world order of climate change denial A key figure picked to prepare the US federal environment agency for life under a Donald Trump administration has met in Washington DC with some of the worldâ€™s most notorious and longest-serving climate science deniers, including One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts. Myron Ebell, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), was picked by the now president-elect to lead the Environmental Protection Agency â€œtransition teamâ€\\x9d back in September. Trump has pledged to strip many powers from the EPA to boost fossil fuel production. Ebell has spent two decades trying to undermine the science linking dangerous climate change to fossil fuel burning. E&E News reported that Ebell was at one meeting hosted by the CEI and held in the hearing room of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. The EPW committee is chaired by Senator James Inhofe who, like Trump, has described human-caused climate change as a hoax. The meeting was not open to the public or the press, E&E News reported, with Ebell refusing to give any details. Climate denial whoâ€™s who But details of the gatherings have been made public by some of the climate science denialists who attended. The attendee list reads like a whoâ€™s who of the climate science denial world. Australian senator Malcolm Roberts, of the far-right One Nation party, who is in the US, revealed he had given a speech at a CEI meeting with Ebell. Roberts wrote the meeting was a gathering of the Cooler Heads Coalition and then listed some of the participants. They included Marc Morano, Randy Randol, Steve Milloy, Chris Horner, Craig Rucker, Patrick Michaels, Ken Haapala and James Taylor. The views of most of the attendees are in direct contradiction to the overwhelming majority of scientific research published over decades, as well as the positions of the worldâ€™s major scientific academies. Also listed by Roberts as attending was Breitbart writer James Delingpole, who published a picture of himself, Roberts and Ebell on his Twitter account. Delingpole says climate change is â€œjunk scienceâ€\\x9d and has said that â€œhanging is too goodâ€\\x9d for climate scientists. Denialists reunited Three of the attendees â€” Ebell, Randy Randol and Steve Milloy â€”were part of the Global Climate Science Communications Team in the late 1990s. The GCSC was a coalition of thinktanks and fossil fuel companies that hoped to shift peopleâ€™s understanding of the science linking fossil fuel burning to human-caused climate change. At the time, Randol was a lobbyist for ExxonMobil and Milloy was the executive director of The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition â€” a tobacco industry-funded front group. One of the meetingâ€™s attendees, lawyer Chris Horner, was named this week to Trumpâ€™s EPA â€œlanding teamâ€\\x9d alongside Ebell. Horner, who has been funded by coal companies, is known for launching multiple FOIA requests targeting the email inboxes of climate scientists and government officials. Many see his work as harassment. Also in attendance, according to Roberts, was Fred Singer â€“ a former advisor to TASSC who set up his first group to attack climate science in 1990. Trump this week named current ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as his nomination for the Secretary of State. On Twitter Tony Heller reported that Tim Ball, a retired geography professor and climate science denier from British Columbia, told the EPW meeting: â€œIâ€™ve waited 40 years for this moment.â€\\x9d In November 2016, Ball and Heller were in Australia for speaking engagements at the invitation of Roberts who claims there is no evidence linking climate change to human activity. Ball then travelled to the US for a two-day conference organised by G. Edward Griffin with the title: Global warming: An Inconvenient Lie. Griffin, who runs Freedom Force International, which organised the conference, is a conspiracy theorist who claims there is no such thing as the HIV virus, that climate change is a hoax and that a US military plane shot down one of the passenger flights that crashed during the September 11 attacks in the United States. The full line-up of attendees at the Cooler Heads Coalition listed by Roberts was Tony Heller, Tim Ball, Fred Singer, Ken Haapala, Craig Rucker, Randy Randall, Steve Milloy, Marc Morano, James Delingpole, Chris Horner, Myron Ebell, Tom de Weise, James Taylor, Pat Michaels, Austin Smithson, Brandon Middleton, Marlo Lewis and â€œMandy from Senator James Inhofeâ€™s staffâ€\\x9d.

              "  'A matter of some gravity: how to have an argument on the internet Poor Douglas Carswell. On Twitter last week he confused the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon and got crushed by the far stronger forces of social media. It all happened so quickly. To illustrate the point that Britain trades more with its near neighbours in Europe than larger but more distant economies such as the US or China, Paul Nightingale, professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, tweeted a gravitational analogy that drew a brisk response from Carswell: Nightingale respectfully pointed out the error but the hapless Ukip MP was immediately deluged in a yellow tide of piss-taking. An #AskCarswell hashtag soon popped up to poke further fun at the member for Clacton and the story was gleefully picked up by the press. The derision was deserved â€“ at least to some extent. In the eyes of many Carswell already has a difficult relationship with facts, revealed by his loud insistence during the referendum campaign that the UK would be better off to the tune of Â£350m a week if it left the EU, a claim repeatedly debunked by the head of the UK Statistics Authority. He had also been patronising in responding to the Sussex professor, expressing surprise that the â€œhead of Science research at a university refutes idea sunâ€™s gravity causes tidesâ€\\x9d. Yet itâ€™s also true that Carswell was less wrong than many people realised. One tweeter pointed out that the sunâ€™s gravitational influence on the tides is actually about 40% that of the moonâ€™s, which was news to me â€” and I have a degree in physics. Judging from his timeline, Carswell has so far admitted no scientific error. Instead he tried to move the conversation back to trade and Brexit (though even here, the weight of evidence appears to be on Nightingaleâ€™s side). I suspect he was mildly embarrassed by the faux pas but felt little desire to acknowledge as much before the sneering chorus on Twitter. Why expose yourself to further mockery? But Iâ€™m speculating here â€“ Iâ€™ve never met Carswell so donâ€™t really know what makes him tick. Today, the incident is largely forgotten. Just another twitterstorm in a teacup. But the trouble is that this is how it goes day after day on social media. Thanks to the internet, communication far beyond our real life social circles has never been easier but itâ€™s hard to escape the impression that the quality of our public discourse has never been poorer. Carswellâ€™s gravitational spat may pale beside the pervasive currents of misogyny, racism, homophobia, antisemitism and islamophobia that wash daily across the online world, but the descent into mockery and vitriol is all too rapid, whatever the topic. When was the last time you saw an enlightening exchange between a Corbynista and a Blairite? What is it about life online that unleashes our inner demons? We seem to have made a leap in technology for which evolution, in its blind stumbling, has not prepared us. Most likely it is another distancing effect, this time due to computerisation. We might now be able to connect with half the world but we do so from behind a keyboard. The faces â€“ and the humanity â€“ of the people that we interact with are easily lost in the rapid fire of typed exchanges. It is little wonder that some newspapers are closing down their comment threads. Though this may partly be for economic reasons, it is surely also an acknowledgement that they add little to public debate. Iâ€™ve succumbed myself from time to time â€“ and in these pages. I have on occasion taken exception to what I felt to be largely ill-founded critiques of science and scientists by the columnist Simon Jenkins, and responded with outrage, with mockery and with facts. But after the latest exchange, I paused to re-consider. It might have been cathartic to vent my frustration and then to be cheered from the sidelines by friends and followers (almost all of them of a scientific stripe), but to what real end? We just seemed to be talking past one another. So I tried a different tack. I bought a copy of one of my favourite popular science books (Matthew Cobbâ€™s Lifeâ€™s Greatest Secret) and sent it to the columnist with a conciliatory note, to follow up on the offer of buying him a drink that I had appended to my latest broadside. And blow me if he didnâ€™t email back to accept the invitation. A couple of weeks ago we met in a quiet bar around the corner from where I work and over a couple of pints of a rather tasty Kent lager talked about science, universities, Brexit, grammar schools, Northern Ireland, and the travails of online discourse. I wonâ€™t go into specifics since it was a private encounter but, while we still might not agree on everything, face-to-face there was plenty of cordiality and common ground. I know what youâ€™re thinking: â€œTwo people who write for the had a drink and found that they agreed on some stuff? Big deal!â€\\x9d Well, yes, Iâ€™m skating on platitudinous ice and this is hardly an original point, but the meeting was to me an important reminder of how the human factor, so vivid in real life, is so readily forgotten online. Itâ€™s complicated. Although anonymity is often blamed for online rudeness, it can also foster participation and risk-taking, opening up new opportunities for discussion. But how do we find the right balance between open, constructive argument and ending up in an echo-chamber? This question is at the core of the â€™s laudable The Web We Want campaign. There are no easy answers â€“ though some experiments in nudging community self-regulation online are showing promise. Even scientists need to be mindful of becoming trapped in tribal enclaves, whatever the provocation. On Twitter I try to use the mute button sparingly â€“ only when the rancour gets too much. Each time I do feels like a defeat but I just donâ€™t have the time or the heart to engage with every dispute. And although itâ€™s not possible to have a drink with everyone you end up arguing with on the internet, I have resolved to try to imagine doing so. That strategy will make little headway with the out-and-out trolls or the shitposters, but there are still plenty of people of good faith out there that I disagree with profoundly. Carswell may well be one of them. Should we happen to rub up against one another online, hopefully at least one of us can take away something positive from the encounter.

              "  'Natalie Cole, singer and daughter of Nat King Cole, dies aged 65 Natalie Cole, the award-winning singer and daughter of jazz legend Nat King Cole, has died. Cole, whose hits included This Will Be and Unforgettable, died aged 65 on Thursday night, according to her publicist Maureen Oâ€™Connor. Her family said she died at Cedars-Sinai medical centre in Los Angeles due to complications from ongoing health issues. â€œNatalie fought a fierce, courageous battle, dying how she lived â€¦ with dignity, strength and honour. Our beloved mother and sister will be greatly missed and remain unforgettable in our hearts forever,â€\\x9d read the statement from her son, Robert Yancy, and sisters Timolin and Casey Cole. The singer had battled drug problems and hepatitis for many years. She had a kidney transplant in May 2009. Fellow performers paid tribute on Friday night following the news of her death. Aretha Franklin said: â€œI am sorry to hear about Natalie Coleâ€™s passing. I had to hold back the tears. I know how hard she fought. She fought for so long. She was one of the greatest singers of our time.â€\\x9d Tony Bennett described her as â€œan exceptional jazz singerâ€\\x9d. He said: â€œIt was an honour to have recorded and performed with her on several occasions. She was a lovely and generous person who will be greatly missed.â€\\x9d Dionne Warwick said she was â€œmore like family than friend â€¦ My heart aches. My sincere condolences to her family and may she now rest in peace.â€\\x9d The Rev Jesse Jackson tweeted: â€œ#NatalieCole, sister beloved & of substance and sound. May her soul rest in peace. #Inseperable.â€\\x9d The comedian Arsenio Hall said he named his bass guitar after her when he was in college. â€œAs a young stand up comic I opened for Natalie Cole. She was all that, in all ways! (RIP ).â€\\x9d Coleâ€™s greatest success came with her 1991 album, Unforgettable â€¦ With Love, which paid tribute to her father with reworked versions of some of his best known-songs, including That Sunday That Summer, Too Young and Mona Lisa. Her voice was spliced with her fatherâ€™s in the title track, offering a delicate duet more than 25 years after his death. The album sold about 14m copies and won six Grammys, including album of the year, and record and song of the year for the title track. While making the album, Cole said she had to â€œthrow out every R&B lick that I had ever learned and every pop trick I had ever learned. With him, the music was in the background and the voice was in the front.â€\\x9d Cole was also nominated for an Emmy award in 1992 for a televised performance of her fatherâ€™s songs. â€œThat was really my thank you,â€\\x9d she said in 2006. â€œI owed that to him.â€\\x9d Another father-daughter duet, When I Fall in Love, won a Grammy in 1996 for best pop collaboration with vocals, and a follow-up album, Still Unforgettable, won best traditional pop vocal album of 2008. Born in Los Angeles to Nat King Cole, who was already a well-known singer, and former Duke Ellington Orchestra singer Maria Hawkins Ellington, Cole was exposed to some of the greats of US soul music. By the age of six, she sang on her fatherâ€™s Christmas album and by 11 was performing in her own right. In 2008, she said: â€œI still love recording and still love the stage, but like my dad, I have the most fun when I am in front of that glorious orchestra or that kick-butt big band.â€\\x9d In her 2000 autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder, Cole discussed how she had battled heroin, crack cocaine and alcohol addiction for many years. She spent six months in rehab in 1983. When she announced in 2008 that she had been diagnosed with hepatitis C, a liver disease spread through contact with infected blood, she blamed her past intravenous drug use. Cole received chemotherapy to treat the hepatitis and â€œwithin four months, I had kidney failureâ€\\x9d, she told CNNâ€™s Larry King in 2009. She needed dialysis three times a week until she received a donor kidney on 18 May 2009. Cole toured through much of her illness, often receiving dialysis at hospitals around the world. â€œI think that I am a walking testimony [that] you can have scars,â€\\x9d she told People magazine. â€œYou can go through turbulent times and still have victory in your life.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'The Man Who Fell to Earth review â€“ a freaky concept album of a film Nicolas Roegâ€™s The Man Who Fell to Earth is rereleased after 40 years and it looks more exotic, more preposterous, more fascinating than ever, like a hyper-evolved midnight movie in the manner of Roger Corman. Roeg shows us some of his classic narrative dislocations and juxtapositions; this has something of Stanley Kubrickâ€™s 2001, but Roeg is genuinely uninhibited about sex in a way that Kubrick never was. And of course there is an extraordinary sui generis central performance by David Bowie as the intergalactic visitor Thomas Newton â€“ his unselfconscious gentleness and vulnerability now look very moving and bizarrely authentic in a way that they didnâ€™t in 1976. Is the movie a metaphor for immigration and innovation and a sclerotic corporate culture? Or is it perhaps a pop culture parable for the British music invasion? (I like to think that Newtonâ€™s astronaut-ambitions inspired our own Richard Branson.) Or is it simply about Bowie himself? The story unfolds in a daring sequence of narrative leaps. Newton crash-lands in a small town where he is befriended by a hotel receptionist Mary Lou (Candy Clark) in whose presence this delicate stripling faints; she has to carry him to his room â€“ an extraordinary sequence. They become an item. Newton quickly finds himself in New York, where his superior intelligence and knowledge allow him to create a world-beating energy and media company, which hires a disillusioned, lecherous chemistry professor Nathan Bryce (Rip Torn), the only person in whom the increasingly reclusive Newton can confide. Newton needs to establish utter mastery of Earthâ€™s technology so that he use its water for his own drought-stricken planet. But, far from being a sinister predator, Newton is a delicate victim, a Wildean holy child of poignant unworldliness, whose business is taken from him. He stays young while everyone else gets old. A freaky, compelling concept album of a film.',\n",
              "  'Manchester United 2-0 Southampton: Premier League â€“ as it happened An eventually comfortable win for Manchester United, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring both goals â€“ the first a thrilling, cavemanic header. Paul Pogba improved as the match progressed and showed his class with some penetrating runs and cocky passing. Southampton had more of the ball and should not be remotely discouraged by their performance, the thought of which will keep their fans warm for at least 10 minutes of their 47-journey home. Thanks for your company; goodnight. 90+3 min In the last minute of added time, Pogba spanks wide of the near post from 18 yards after fine play from Mkhitaryan. 89 min Still no sign of Marcus Rashford, as Chris Smalling comes on to replace Wayne Rooney. He put in a good cross for the first goal but was otherwise ineffective. 88 min Targettâ€™s low cross is curled a few yards wide of the near post by Tadic. That, as Alan Smith says on Sky, sums up their night â€“ they have played some really good football but have not been efficient in the final third. 86 min â€œEvening Rob,â€\\x9d says Simon McMahon. â€œYour other reader may not know that Pogbaâ€™s brother Mathias plays for Partick Thistle in the SPFL. I saw him play at Tannadice the other week in the League Cup. Heâ€™s not worth 100 million euros, but could his brother cut it at a wet and windy Tannadice in front of 4000 fans on a Tuesday night?â€\\x9d 84 min Southampton make their final substitution, with Jay Rodriguez replacing an aggrieved Shane Long. 83 min The sliding Bailly does well to intercept Targettâ€™s dangerous low cross. Southampton have shown an admirable refusal to accept they have lost this game. 82 min Ander Herrera replaces Anthony Martial, which suggests a switch to 4-3-3 and a shutting up of shop. 80 min â€œDo you know what were the pre-season odds for Ibrahimovic to finish top scorer, or to win the Player of the Year awards?â€\\x9d asks David Wall. â€œFor someone with his record there seemed more talk of him as someone merely doing a valedictory tour than of him as someone perhaps a little past his prime but still a bonafide star, game-changing, season-shaping player. Now heâ€™s taking penalties as well as being Unitedâ€™s main striker heâ€™s sure to be in the running to lead the goal-scoring tables (barring injury, of course).â€\\x9d I donâ€™t know the odds. But yes, for a team in transition it looks like an extremely smart short-term move. Heâ€™s 34 going on 29. The three behind him isnâ€™t quite right yet, though. 79 min The game isnâ€™t quite petering out - Southampton keep coming back for more - but there is a persuasive sense that itâ€™s over as a contest. 77 min So whatâ€™s going on with Marcus Rashford then? If I were a United fan that would worry me a bit, because he is a glorious talent. 76 min Pogba marauds infield from the left and then curls well wide from just outside the box. 74 min Long flicks a near-post header just wide of the far post from Soaresâ€™s cross, and then Mata is replaced by Henrikh Mkhitaryan. 73 min If it goes to 2-1 then Mourinho might take Pogba off but thereâ€™s no need at the moment, especially as heâ€™s having his best period of the match with the ball. Tonight is all about Pogba and Ibrahimovic but Valencia has been a revelation going forward, close to his 2009-12 best. 69 min Pogba, who is starting to boss the game, gives it to Valencia on the right. He skins Targett and stands up a deep cross to Ibrahimovic, who rises imperiously and then completely mistimes a looping header back across goal. Rooney was flagged offside but it wasnâ€™t going in anyway. 67 min â€œRob,â€\\x9d says Mark Tuite, â€œwho is this Tasic you keep banging on about?â€\\x9d No idea. Youâ€™re welcome! 66 min United are playing some great stuff now. Pogba ignores the cries of â€œshoooootâ€\\x9d and gives it wide to Ibrahimovic. He plays a deliberate chip all the way across the area to Martial, who dummies Soares by pulling it down on his chest but then seems to forget to shoot and is tackled by the recovering Soares. Moments later, Davis is replaced by Charlie Austin for Southampton. 65 min Martial scorches past Fonte and into the area, where his shot is outstandingly blocked by Van Dijk. The ball rebounds to Rooney, who chips it pitifully out of play. Moments later, Martial finds the underlapping Shaw in the area and his cutback is cleared. That was a great run from Shaw. 63 min Pogba beats Clasie beautifully without touching the ball to start a move that leads to a corner on the right. Itâ€™s curled in and headed over from six yards by Pogba, under pressure from a defender. 61 min A mistake from Zlatan allows Southampton to break. Van Dijkâ€™s sot is blocked by Bailly and then Clasie splashes the follow-up miles wide from 20 yards. Southampton have done lots of things very well tonight; United have just been more efficient. 58 min Southampton continue to push forward. A cross from the right is flicked towards Redmond, who canâ€™t quite get it out of his feet and eventually shoots wide under pressure from Mata. That was a decent opportunity. In an unrelated development, it turns out the Tadic goal was disallowed, rightly, for offside. 55 min Pogbaâ€™s confidence is one of his greatest strengths. Heâ€™ll take the ball in any situation, no matter how tight or dangerous. There are still doubts as to whether heâ€™s a better central-midfield option than Rafael and Ji-sung Park but he is a fascinating talent. Zlatan makes it four goals in three games with a good penalty, sidefooting into the bottom-left corner before roaring to the crowd while flexing his muscles. He is a preposterous and magnificent man. A daft trip by Clasie on Shaw, who was going nowhere. Itâ€™s a clear penalty. 50 min Martial comes infield from the left and hits a dangerous low shot that bounces just in front of Forster. He does well to palm it away and itâ€™s lumped clear by a defender. 49 min Tasic has a goal disallowed for a foul on Bailly. His lack of complaint suggests it was fair enough, though we havenâ€™t seen a replay. It was a smart flicked header but I think he shoved Bailly out of the way. 48 min â€œIn Pogba it looks to me like Mourinho has finally got his hands on the Gerrard type player heâ€™s wanted since he came to the Premier League,â€\\x9d says Phil Martin. â€œItâ€™ll be interesting to see what he does with him, does he coach out the risks, or build his team around covering for them?â€\\x9d Heâ€™ll change him a bit but Pogbaâ€™s main weakness is decision-making and that should improve naturally. I canâ€™t see Mourinho going the full Joe Cole, certainly. Iâ€™d imagine heâ€™ll eventually play 4-3-3 and let Pogba run free. 47 min An intrepid run from the impressive Shaw takes him to the edge of the area before he is tackled. The ball runs to Mata, who wallops it into orbit from range. 46 min Southampton begin the second half, trailing to a moment of Zlatanic magic in a first half that they dominated. Kipling latest â€œâ€˜If you can concede to a ridiculous header from a certifiable genius, And still knock it about prettily in the middle of the park, Youâ€™ll be a man, my son,â€™â€\\x9d says Matt Dony of my 42nd-minute entry. â€œOf course, the implication being that â€˜manhoodâ€™ is something to aspire to and inherently better than those weak women. Typical media sexism. Youâ€™ll be blaming the immigrants, next.â€\\x9d Nigel Farage is my Rushmore, what of it? Half-time reading United lead, slightly against the run of play, through a fierce header from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Paul Pogba has been brave and progressive in possession, though not always successfully. Southampton have had more of the ball and are certainly in this. See you in 10 minutes! 44 min Davis, who has probably had more of the ball than any midfielder on either side, drills over the top from 25 yards. 43 min Pogba thrills the crowd with a fine run straight down the centre of the pitch before playing the ball to Martial. His cross is disappointing, just as he has been so far. His unhappy Euro 2016 might have affected his confidence. 42 min Southampton have reacted to the goal in a manner that would please Kipling, resuming their confident possession football. They have been the better team, although let the record show that United seem happy enough playing on the counter-attack. 41 min â€œAll the attributes of an English No9 allied to the nonchalant sills of a Balkan No10,â€\\x9d says Adam Hirst. â€œWish heâ€™d arrived six years ago.â€\\x9d What, about of Bebe? No thanks. 39 min â€œJudging purely from the Man Utd teamsheet, they donâ€™t appear to have a midfield of any description,â€\\x9d says Ian Copestake. â€œUnless you count Fellaini as a midfield target man.â€\\x9d United take the lead against the run of play with a belting header from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Valencia found Rooney on the right, and he did well to keep the ball in play. Then he curled a high, outswinging cross towards the far post, where Ibrahimovic beasted above Fonte and thumped a downward header into the net from 10 yards. 34 min A well-struck low shot from Rooney, 25 yards from goal, is comfortably saved by Forster. 32 min A chance for Southampton. Tadic sweeps an excellently early ball into the space behind Bailly to find Long in an inside-left position just outside the box. With Bailly making up the ground, Long hits a feeble low shot straight at De Gea. That was the best chance so far. 30 min Mataâ€™s volleyed pass somehow finds its way to Ibrahimovic, whose cross from the right towards Rooney takes an important deflection off the sliding Van Dijk and goes behind for a corner. 29 min A Hollywood move from United: Pogbaâ€™s dink, Mataâ€™s header across the box and Zlatanâ€™s flying volley over the bar. It was a quarter-chance at best. 28 min Pass count: Man Utd 94-160 Southampton. United donâ€™t really mind playing on the counter-attack, though having pace up front would help. Rooney is, sad to say, peripheral at best and embarrassing at worst. 26 min Davisâ€™s flat, fast free-kick finds Van Dijk, whose volley is well blocked by Valencia. The ball comes to Long, who rattles it just wide of the near post. There were cheers from some of the Southampton fans, who thought it was in; a fleeting moment of joy before the reality of a 47-hour trip home with nothing but a bottle of warm Volvic to sustain them hit home once again. 25 min At the moment United look like a collection of players rather than a team. Itâ€™s a clichÃ© but itâ€™s true. The sooner they get Rashford in the side, for Mata, Rooney or even Martial, the better they will be. Southampton have a serious chance of winning this game. 23 min â€œThanks for the MBM, it is the only way I have to follow the game while waiting for my flight in Ougadougou airport,â€\\x9d writes Danny Kelly. â€œDo you think Ferguson secretly hopes that Pogba will be a failure thus vindicating his, now infamous, decision not to offer him a better contract and keep him at the club?â€\\x9d I thought the issue was playing time rather than the quality of his contract? Either way, I doubt Ferguson cares, at least not in terms of professional vindication. It might be different on a personal level. He canâ€™t be happy about Pogba or Mourinho being at the club. 22 min Valencia has been Unitedâ€™s best attacker so far. Pogba has been up and down but with his usual willingness to take the risky option whenever possible. Rooney and Zlatan have been anonymous. 19 min Redmond spins neatly behind Bailly and into the area on the right. Tadic is free at the far post, a few yards from goal, but Redmond just overhits the cross. Southampton are, at the moment, playing like the home side. 18 min I certainly wouldnâ€™t rule out a third consecutive Southampton win at Old Trafford. They have started this game very impressively, especially when you consider they were supposed to roll over. 17 min â€œPoor Rob,â€\\x9d says Ian Copestake. â€œI bet you would like to wet your whistle this footballing Friday night. Have Sky attached some epithet to this day of days? Super is obviously not applicable or alliterative enough, but it must be an f-word of sorts.â€\\x9d Arenâ€™t they just calling it FNF? Or, if youâ€™re a Southampton fan who has to get home tonight, FFS. 15 min A cross from the left eventually bounces to Tadic, who volleys into orbit from a tight angle. This is a pretty open game. But then this is not a typical Jose Mourinho side; they are pretty top heavy. 13 min Ibrahimovic on the left eases the ball back to Pogba, who opens his body smartly just inside the box. and hits a decent shot that is patted down by Forster. 13 min â€œHi,â€\\x9d says John. â€œPogbaâ€™s headphones are P7 not P5.â€\\x9d Typical embarrassing Grauniad error. Somebody deserves a P45 for that, and Iâ€™m not talking about headphones. 12 min Romeu is indeed replaced by Jordi Clasie. Mataâ€™s corner is headed clear by Shane Long. 11 min Valencia combines well with Mata, whose return pass is put behind for a corner by Davis. Romeu is down again, and might need to be replaced before the corner is taken. 10 min â€œâ€˜If two teams play a game of football and the media couldnâ€™t give a flying toss about the smaller team, do they actually exist?â€™,â€\\x9d begins Tamara Hampton, quoting an earlier entry. â€œSo does that make Southampton #SchrÃ¶dingersTeam?â€\\x9d In modern football, SchrÃ¶dinger has a lot of teams. 9 min Thereâ€™s a break in play while Romeu receives treatment. Heâ€™s fine. 7 min Southamptonâ€™s passing has been confident and assured in the early stages. Itâ€™s been a bright, breezy start to the game. 5 min Valencia, who has staked an early claim to be the surprise success of Mourinhoâ€™s first season, wins a corner with the kind of no-frills run he used to attempt all the time in the Ferguson years. Nowt comes from it but that was more promising for United. 4 min After a long spell of Southampton possession, United get to touch the ball. Pogba tries a cute pass to Ibrahimovic that is well cut out by Soares. 1 min Peep peep! United kick off from right to left. Pogba gives the ball away immediately and Southampton break dangerously to win a free-kick right on the edge of the box. Itâ€™s a fair way to the left of centre but well within shooting range. Tadic blasts it straight into the wall. â€œWho is the ref?â€\\x9d asks Peter Nelson, politely highlight the inadequacy of my work thus far. It is Anthony Taylor, and heâ€™s about to moisten his whistle. â€œI donâ€™t have any answers to the questions in your Preamble but the Bowers & Wilkins P5 headphones Pogba is wearing are really great,â€\\x9d says Petter Settli, chief executive of Bowers & Wilkins . They are Pre-match reading Wouldnâ€™t bother with the article but some of the comments are well banter. Hereâ€™s our man Ryan Dunne â€œIs it wrong to wonder where Fellaini-Pogba ranks on the most mismatched midfield pairings, talent-wise?â€\\x9d I canâ€™t believe youâ€™re writing Pogba off already. Honk! Ho-honk! Honk? Actually I think Roy Keane and Michael Appleton played together against Swindon in 1996, which is a bit of a mismatch. â€œSkyâ€™s new show pretty much redefining the term â€˜one-eyedâ€™,â€\\x9d says Gary Naylor. â€œI donâ€™t often find fault with Skyâ€™s sports coverage, but this is ridiculous. There are two teams playing tonight.â€\\x9d Ah, but you know what the philosophers say: if two teams play a game of football and the media couldnâ€™t give a flying toss about the smaller team, do they actually exist? Manchester United (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Valencia, Bailly, Blind, Shaw; Fellaini, Pogba; Mata, Rooney, Martial; Ibrahimovic. Substitutes: Romero, Smalling, Herrera, Schneiderlin, Young, Mkhitaryan, Rashford. Southampton (4-D-2) Forster; Soares, Fonte, Van Dijk, Targett; Romeu; Hojbjerg, Davis; Tadic; Long, Redmond. Substitutes: McCarthy, Yoshida, Clasie, Rodriguez, Austin, Ward-Prowse, Pied. Hello. In the last few years Old Trafford has doubled up as a public nap station, but nobody will be getting 40 winks tonight. Manchester United host Southampton in a match that is full of talking points before a ball has been miskicked. Will Paul Pogba start on his return to Old Trafford? Where is Stormzy watching the game? How will Zlatan fare on his home debut? Will Jose Mourinho be able to maintain as his poker face as he finally, finally lives his dream of walking down the Old Trafford touchline as Manchester United manager? Will he continue to ignore the otherworldly talent of Marcus Rashford so that he can postpone an awkward conversation with Wayne Rooney? Will anyone acknowledge the existence of Southampton, let alone point out that they have won here in the past two seasons? Will Southamptonâ€™s fans make it home for Sunday lunch? Is the introduction of Friday Night Football a deliberate attempt to sabotage the viewing ratings of Nightmare Tenants, Slum Landlords on Channel 5? And what did happen to Arthur Graham? Kick off at 8pm BST. Rob will be with you shortly. In the meantime, why not have a read of Sachin Nakrani on Friday night football and GIL! SCOTT! HERON!',\n",
              "  \"Hillary Clinton denies foundation donors' influence â€“ as it happened Donald Trumpâ€™s new presidential campaign chief is registered to vote in a key swing state in an empty house where he does not live, in an apparent breach of election laws. Stephen Bannon, the chief executive of Trumpâ€™s election campaign, has an active voter registration at the house in Miami-Dade County, Florida, which is vacant and due to be demolished to make way for a new development. ...or, at least, he was, until today. After the disclosed that he was previously registered at an empty house in Florida where he did not live, Bannon moved his voter registration to the home of one his websiteâ€™s writers. Bannon also faced domestic violence charges after a fight with a woman he was married to 20 years ago, in which she accused him of grabbing her by the neck â€œviolentlyâ€\\x9d and destroying a telephone when she tried to summon police. Documents from the Santa Monica, California, police department relating to the case were first published by Politico on Thursday. The case was eventually dismissed. A Maine state lawmaker has complied with Maine governor Paul LePageâ€™s request that he, the lawmaker, make public a voicemail in which LePage calls him a â€œcocksuckerâ€\\x9d and a â€œlittle son-of-a-bitch socialist cocksucker.â€\\x9d The unpleasantness arose out of LePageâ€™s belief that the lawmaker, Democratic Representative Drew Gattine, had called LePage a racist. Gattine denies that. â€œI want you to prove that Iâ€™m a racist,â€\\x9d LePage challenges Gattine in the voicemail, which you can listen to on the Portland Press Herald web site. â€œIâ€™ve spent my life helping black people.â€\\x9d LePage, a Republican, gets on well with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in a relationship the Boston Globe has described as a â€œbromance.â€\\x9d LePageâ€™s daughter is a state coordinator for the Trump campaign. Iraq war co-architect and former deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz has told Der Spiegel that he will probably have to vote for Hillary Clinton. Wolfowitz told Spiegel that Trump represented a security risk and that his apparent affection for Russian president Vladimir Putin was â€œdisturbing.â€\\x9d NJ.com reports that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is at least partially behind Donald Trumpâ€™s moderation this week on immigration. Trump indicated for the first time this week that he may be open to an immigration reform plan that includes a path to legal status for some undocumented migrants. The Trump campaign debuted its iPhone application this morning to relatively little fanfare - its release was accompanied by an email, but no tweets from the candidate himself - but privacy experts in the tech sphere are already casting a wary eye at the â€œAmerica Firstâ€\\x9d app as a potentially serious security risk for its users. According to ABC News, anyone who downloads the app opens the gate for the campaign to access and collect unusually vast quantities of data, including their entire address book and contact lists. Donald Trumpâ€™s gastroenterologist wrote the letter stating that Trump â€œwill be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidencyâ€\\x9d in a matter of minutes, according to an interview the doctor gave NBCâ€™s Lester Holt. Dr. Harold Bornstein told NBC that he stands by the assertion that Trump would be the healthiest man to ever hold the nationâ€™s highest office, saying of the obvious hyperbole: â€œI like that sentence, to be quite honest with you.â€\\x9d Bornsteinâ€™s one-page assessment of the septuagenarianâ€™s health - in which he called Trumpâ€™s latest test results â€œextraordinarily excellentâ€\\x9d - have drawn new scrutiny since the letterâ€™s release in December as the candidate and his acolytes have pointed to conspiracy theories that rival Hillary Clinton suffers from any number of secret ailments, from epilepsy to fainting spells, as proof that she does not have the â€œstaminaâ€\\x9d to serve as president. Bornstein said that the decidedly non-medical language he used in the letter was gleaned from Trumpâ€™s own vernacular: â€œI think I picked up his kind of language and then just interpreted it to my own.â€\\x9d Bornsteinâ€™s credentials have been called into question, after CNNâ€™s Sanjay Gupta pointed out that the professional gastroenterological association mentioned in the letter has not counted Bornstein as a member for decades. Additionally, Bornsteinâ€™s website redirects to something called Annoying Teddy, a teddy bear that sings for three hours at a time. Speaking to a roundtable of Latino business leaders in Las Vegas, Donald Trump bragged - without apparently secret evidence - that his campaign is doing well with Latino voters: â€œWeâ€™ve been doing very, very well with the Latinos, weâ€™ve been doing amazing - far, far greater... than anyone understands,â€\\x9d Trump said. â€œAnd they want to see jobs coming in, weâ€™re going to bring jobs. They want to see things happen, I donâ€™t know if you just saw, the GDP was just reduced from last month to 1.1%, when they had it last month it was 1.2, everyone thought that was a catastrophe, well they just did an adjustment and brought it down.â€\\x9d The â€œattackâ€\\x9d in question: releasing a transcript of Jill Steinâ€™s sitdown with the Washington Postâ€™s editorial board. Jared Taylor was prominently featured in a Hillary Clinton campaign ad released ahead of her speech denouncing the â€œalt-rightâ€\\x9d in Reno on Thursday and â€œappreciatesâ€\\x9d the Democratic presidential nominee for â€œcalling attention to the message I have for Americaâ€\\x9d. The self-described â€œrace realistâ€\\x9d is unrepentant in embracing the label and expounding his views. He founded the alt-right American Renaissance website 25 years ago, which started as a print monthly to emphasize race as societyâ€™s most â€œprominent and divisiveâ€\\x9d fault line, and that mainstream politics and media tries to â€œgloss overâ€\\x9d the issue. Clinton has attacked Trumpâ€™s associations with the alt-right, describing it as a â€œa fringe element that has taken over the Republican partyâ€\\x9d. Taylor said her speech was â€œa typical lefty campaign ployâ€\\x9d, and maintained Trump is not a part of the movement. â€œIs Hillary Clinton responsible for the views of everyone who supports her?â€\\x9d he asked. Asked to define what the diffuse alt-right stands for, Taylor said there were â€œareas of disagreementâ€\\x9d, but that â€œthe central element of the alt-right is the position it takes on race.â€\\x9d That position, until recently, would have been clearly beyond the pale of presidential politics, and rejected by liberals and mainstream conservatives alike. Now, Taylor sees an opportunity to further proselytise his views. He does not think Trump is solely responsible for the alleged growth of the alt-right. But, â€œit is encouraging because here we have a candidate for president who is saying some things that we have been saying for yearsâ€\\x9d. Donald Trump, for one, is still an avid reader of Breitbart News: Statement from the Iowa chair of the Republican party on Hillary Clintonâ€™s â€œalt-rightâ€\\x9d speech: Hillary Clintonâ€™s latest strategy of deflecting from her corrupt pay-to-play scheme at the State Department by leveling personal attacks against Donald Trump is as desperate as it is predictable. For decades, Hillary and other Democrats have taken minority support for granted while offering them embarrassingly little results. Donald Trumpâ€™s powerful message of hope, opportunity and empowerment for minority communities threatens to resonate with Hillaryâ€™s base, and thatâ€™s why sheâ€™s lashing out. Hillary Clinton can add the endorsement of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce to her pile of endorsements from LGBTQ-oriented organizations, with business associationâ€™s CEO declaring in a statement this afternoon that LGBTQ Americans have â€œcome too far to lose [their] seat at the tableâ€\\x9d. â€œThe National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce has never endorsed a candidate in its nearly fifteen year history, but the stakes have never been so high for the future of the LGBT business community,â€\\x9d said NGLCC co-founder and CEO Chance Mitchell in a statement. Calling Clinton â€œthe progressive champion our businesses and our families need to thrive,â€\\x9d the head of the nationâ€™s largest business organization for LGBTQ people wrote that the advocacy group is â€œcertain that Secretary Clinton will be the president fighting for the collective economic and social longevity of Americaâ€™s 1.4 million LGBT business owners.â€\\x9d In its endorsement, the Washington, DC-headquartered organization, which aims to expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ businesses and business owners, cited Clintonâ€™s long (albeit checkered) history of advocacy for LGBTQ communities, including her support for antidiscrimination legislation and reduction of red tape for small businesses. â€œThe NGLCC and our partners are proud to endorse a champion for equality and opportunity who will promote the Democratic Partyâ€™s most progressive platform yet,â€\\x9d added Mitchell. â€œSecretary Clinton proudly affirms an essential core value of the NGLCC: that we are all stronger together, and that our economy only succeeds when the American Dream is available to all LGBT and allied Americans.â€\\x9d Clinton responded enthusiastically to the endorsement: â€œI am honored to have earned the first-ever endorsement of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce,â€\\x9d Clinton said in a statement. â€œThe stakes in this election could not be higher for LGBT Americans. When Donald Trump says heâ€™ll â€˜make America great again,â€™ thatâ€™s code for â€˜take America backwards.â€™ He has said he would appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality. The man Trump chose as his running mate signed a law that opened the door for Indiana businesses to discriminate against LGBT people and said marriage equality could cause â€˜societal collapse.â€™â€\\x9d â€œAs weâ€™ve seen in North Carolina, discrimination isnâ€™t only wrong â€“ itâ€™s bad for business. North Carolinaâ€™s egregious HB2 measure has caused companies to pull jobs and millions of dollars out of the state.â€\\x9d The Trump campaign debuted its iPhone application this morning to relatively little fanfare - its release was accompanied by an email, but no tweets from the candidate himself - but privacy experts in the tech sphere are already casting a wary eye at the â€œAmerica Firstâ€\\x9d app as a potentially serious security risk for its users. According to ABC News, anyone who downloads the app opens the gate for the campaign to access and collect unusually vast quantities of data, including their entire address book and contact lists. The appâ€™s privacy policy informs users that the campaign â€œmay access, collect, and store personal information about other people that is available to us through your contact list and/or address book.â€\\x9d Thatâ€™s a long step further than Hillary Clintonâ€™s analogous campaign application, which does not acquire any contact information beyond that of the user. â€œTrumpâ€™s is asking to collect significantly more data, and not just data about you, but data about anyone who might be in your contact list,â€\\x9d technology and civil liberties policy director at the ACLU of Northern California Nicole Ozer told ABC News. â€œYou have the situation where an individual is wanting to use the app, and theyâ€™re making decisions about other peopleâ€™s privacy,â€\\x9d Ozer said. â€œJust because you choose to use an app, doesnâ€™t mean that all the people you come in contact with want information about them shared with that campaign or that company.â€\\x9d Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign chief has moved his voter registration to the home of one his websiteâ€™s writers, after the disclosed that he was previously registered at an empty house in Florida where he did not live. Stephen Bannon is now registered to vote at the Florida house of Andy Badolato, who reports for Breitbart News and has worked with Bannon in the past on the production of political films. According to public records, Badolato, 52, and two of his adult sons are also registered to vote at the property, which he co-owns with his ex-wife. A spokeswoman for Bannon, a spokesman for Trump, and Badolato did not respond to emailed questions about whether Bannon lives at the single-family house, which is listed as his residence on his new voter registration record in Sarasota County. Alexandra Preate, a spokeswoman for Bannon, said earlier in an email that â€œMr Bannon moved to a different residence in Floridaâ€\\x9d, repeating a statement about the issue that was previously released by Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller. The Sarasota County supervisor of elections advises new registrants that they must use the address of their legal residence, and notes prominently that applying with untrue information can result in a felony charge punishable by five years in prison or a fine of up to $5,000. Bannon, the recently hired chief executive of Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign, made the amendment to his registration after being contacted by the for a report published on Friday morning about his previous voting registration arrangements. The 62-year-old executive chairman of Breitbart News was from 2014 until this week registered to vote at two rented houses in Miami where his ex-wife lived. The second house has been vacant for months, according to neighbors, and is due to be demolished. Bannon, who owns property in California, works predominantly in Washington and New York. Bannon, his ex-wife Diane Clohesy and the Trump campaign have not disputed that Bannon did not live in the Miami houses with Clohesy when given eight separate opportunities to do so before and after publication. Badolato states on his website that he is an â€œentrepreneur, senior level executive, venture capitalist and seed stage investorâ€\\x9d and claims to have founded companies that reached a total of $26bn in market capitalization. According to federal court records, he has filed for bankruptcy four times since 2008. He is also an â€œeditorial journalist and blog contributorâ€\\x9d at Breitbart News and formerly worked as an associate producer on some of Bannonâ€™s films such as The Undefeated, a documentary about the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Which is your favorite? In 2004 Donald Trump told CNN that he dealt with stress by reflecting on how â€œnothing mattersâ€\\x9d: Donald Trump will attend a fundraiser this evening at Harrahâ€™s casino Lake Tahoe, in an event hosted by the Nevada Republican party. Beforehand he will participate in meetings with local Hispanic leaders and small business owners, according to local reports: NJ.com reports that New Jersey governor Chris Christie is at least partially behind Donald Trumpâ€™s moderation this week on immigration. Trump indicated for the first time this week that he may be open to an immigration reform plan that includes a path to legal status for some undocumented migrants. Former New York City mayor and Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani told NJ.com how it played out, the site reports: And, Giuliani says, even more Christie-inspired changes to Trumpâ€™s immigration stance will be forthcoming, like his call for tracking immigrant visas like Fedex packages, and using the E-Verify system to reduce illegal labor. In an interview with NJ Advance Media on Thursday, Giuliani, a top adviser to the Republican presidential nominee, said Trumpâ€™s recent reversal on immigration policy came after his inner circle for several weeks suggested a more nuanced, practical, and humane approach in dealing with the nationâ€™s 11 million undocumented immigrants. Asked if Christie was responsible for Trumpâ€™s softening approach to immigration, the former mayor responded: â€œThe answer to that question is yes.â€\\x9d Iraq war co-architect and former deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz has told Der Spiegel that he will probably have to vote for Hillary Clinton. Wolfowitz told Spiegel that Trump represented a security risk and that his apparent affection for Russian president Vladimir Putin was â€œdisturbing.â€\\x9d Hillary Clinton voted in favor of the invasion of Iraq. Donald Trump said beforehand that he favored the invasion but later withdrew his support. In this weekâ€™s Politics for Humans podcast â€“ our series that takes on headline news with thoughtful conversations about real lives â€“ host Sabrina Siddiqui takes a look at the great immigration debate of 2016. Sheâ€™s joined by the Republican National Committeeâ€™s Helen Aguirre FerrÃ©, Pulitzer-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas and Cecilia MuÃ±oz, director of the Domestic Policy Council. Have a listen! Barack Obama will campaign for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia on 13 September, and Joe Biden will campaign for the Democrats in multiple events in Ohio on 1 September, the White House has announced. The White House notes that thereâ€™s a voter registration deadline in Pennsylvania on 11 October. Donald Trump confused everyone this week by indicating that he may be open to an arrangement under which undocumented migrants in the United States would be able to stay here if they had no criminal background and pay back taxes. Previously he called for the expulsion of all undocumented migrants, citing as inspiration president Dwight Eisenhowerâ€™s expulsion in the 1950s of hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants. Now Trump tweets that illegal immigration is â€œsuch a big problem for our country-I will solveâ€\\x9d. But thatâ€™s not quite enough information for some people: Arizona senator John McCain, whose primary opponent attacked him yesterday as â€œweakâ€\\x9d and â€œoldâ€\\x9d â€“ McCain turns 80 Monday â€“ has told TMZ that he finds Britney Spears attractive. TMZ caught up with McCain at the Los Angeles airport and asked him to name his favorite â€œyounger generationâ€\\x9d female celebrity (video at TMZ): â€œBritney Spears?â€\\x9d a man off camera said. â€œThere you go,â€\\x9d McCain said. â€œBritney Spears is certainly very attractive.â€\\x9d Spears has a new album out. She also is in a new episode of Carpool Karaoke with Late Late Show host James Corden. Didnâ€™t expect to find reason to add this to todayâ€™s live blog politics coverage, but sometimes everything comes together: (h/t @bencjacobs) In reply to Donald Trumpâ€™s brash pitch to African American voters â€“ â€œwhat do you have to lose?â€\\x9d Trump says â€“ the Hillary Clinton campaign has produced a television ad called â€œEverythingâ€\\x9d: Weâ€™ll post new Trump ads when we see them â€“ there havenâ€™t been any since the one that was released when Trumpâ€™s first TV ad buys were announced last week. Do Instagram videos count? Trump is out with a new one today, hitting Clinton for a 1996 warning about juvenile â€œsuper predatorsâ€\\x9d. The video draws on footage of a Democratic debate in which Bernie Sanders calls the comments â€œracistâ€\\x9d: This May video of Ted Cruz predicting Donald Trump will betray supporters â€œon every issue across the boardâ€\\x9d particularly immigration has aged well: (h/t @awzurcher) Cruz wasnâ€™t alone. Hereâ€™s National Review editor Rich Lowry in January: In news from off the campaign trail, the president has created the largest marine protected area on Earth, which also has what must be competitive for the longest name for a marine protected area, PapahÄ\\x81naumokuÄ\\x81kea. Itâ€™s Friday. Treat yourself to some photos: And read our coverage here: A Maine state lawmaker has complied with Maine governor Paul LePageâ€™s request that he, the lawmaker, make public a voicemail in which LePage calls him a â€œcocksuckerâ€\\x9d and a â€œlittle son-of-a-bitch socialist cocksucker.â€\\x9d The unpleasantness arose out of LePageâ€™s belief that the lawmaker, Democratic Representative Drew Gattine, had called LePage a racist. Gattine denies that. â€œI want you to prove that Iâ€™m a racist,â€\\x9d LePage challenges Gattine in the voicemail, which you can listen to on the Portland Press Herald web site. â€œIâ€™ve spent my life helping black people.â€\\x9d LePage, a Republican, gets on well with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in a relationship the Boston Globe has described as a â€œbromance.â€\\x9d LePageâ€™s daughter is a state coordinator for the Trump campaign. â€œI want you to record this and make it public, because Iâ€™m after you. Thank you,â€\\x9d LePage concludes his voicemail to Gattine. LePage apologized in January for giving voice to a fantasy of marauding outsiders who come to his state to sell drugs and â€œimpregnate a young white girl.â€\\x9d â€œThese are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty â€“ these types of guys â€“ they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home,â€\\x9d LePage said. â€œIncidentally, half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road.â€\\x9d LePage, who had already been known for incendiary rhetoric, said those comments were a â€œmistake.â€\\x9d â€œI was going impromptu and my brain didnâ€™t catch up to my mouth,â€\\x9d LePage said. â€œInstead of Maine women I said white women â€¦ If you go to Maine, you can see itâ€™s 95% white.â€\\x9d Read further: Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Hillary Clinton denied Friday morning that her work as secretary of state was affected by donations to the Clinton charitable foundation, after an Associated Press investigation revealed earlier this week that a large share of meetings she took as secretary with non-governmental counterparts were with foundation donors. â€œMy work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces,â€\\x9d Clinton said in a phone interview with MSNBC. â€œI made policy decisions based on what I thought was right to keep Americans safe and protect our interest abroad. I believe my aides also acted appropriately. And we have gone above and beyond ... to voluntarily disclose donors.â€\\x9d Clinton also suggested that the foundation would become less active on the world stage, saying its governors were â€œtrying to make sure good work continues as we wind it downâ€\\x9d and that â€œthe Foundation is looking for partners but thatâ€™s going to take time to carry outâ€\\x9d. The interview followed a speech Thursday in Reno, Nevada, in which Clinton described what she said was Donald Trumpâ€™s â€œlong history of racial discriminationâ€\\x9d. She repeated that description Friday. Senior Republicans have declined to comment on the speech or its content (read our news coverage of the speech here). That includes the leaders of both chambers of Congress. Separately, it emerged Thursday evening that Stephen Bannon, the head of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, faced domestic violence charges after a fight with a woman he was married to 20 years ago, in which she accused him of grabbing her by the neck â€œviolentlyâ€\\x9d and destroying a telephone when she tried to summon police. Documents from the Santa Monica, California, police department relating to the case were first published by Politico. The case was eventually dismissed. â€œShe complained of soreness to her neck,â€\\x9d wrote a police officer who responded to the incident. â€œI saw red marks on her left wrist and the right side of her neck. These were photographed.â€\\x9d Read further: Additionally, a investigation has revealed that Bannon is registered to vote in a key swing state at an empty house where he does not live, in an apparent breach of election laws. From our report: Stephen Bannon, the chief executive of Trumpâ€™s election campaign, has an active voter registration at the house in Miami-Dade County, Florida, which is vacant and due to be demolished to make way for a new development. â€œI have emptied the property,â€\\x9d Luis Guevara, the owner of the house, which is in the Coconut Grove section of the city, said in an interview. â€œNobody lives there â€¦ We are going to make a construction there.â€\\x9d Neighbors said the property had been abandoned for several months.

              "  \"Breast cancer study finds 'astonishing' drug combination that gives results Using Herceptin in combination with another drug before surgery shrinks and may even destroy tumours in women with an aggressive form of breast cancer in less than two weeks, an â€œastonishingâ€\\x9d study suggests. The results of the Cancer Research UK-funded trial, presented at the 10th European Breast Cancer Conference in Amsterdam, could â€“ if successfully replicated â€“ lead to fewer women needing chemotherapy. Around a quarter of 66 women with HER2 positive breast cancer treated for 11 days with both trastuzumab (the generic name for Herceptin) and lapatinib saw their tumours rapidly shrink significantly or even disappear. Prof Nigel Bundred, from the University of Manchester and the University Hospital of South Manchester NHS foundation trust, who presented the data, said: â€œThis has groundbreaking potential because it allows us to identify a group of patients who, within 11 days, have had their tumours disappear with anti-HER2 therapy alone and who potentially may not require subsequent chemotherapy. â€œThis offers the opportunity to tailor treatment for each individual woman.â€\\x9d Samia al Qadhi, chief executive at Breast Cancer Care, said: â€œThe astonishing findings in this study show that combining these two drugs has the potential to shrink HER2 positive breast cancer in just 11 days. â€œFor some HER2 positive breast cancer patients the effect of this drug combination will be amazing and mean they can avoid chemotherapy and its gruelling side effects completely. For others, their tumours may not shrink, but doctors will know either way very quickly, giving them the ability to rapidly decide on further treatment. â€œAlthough an early study, this has game changing potential. Yet before this can be made available we need to see more evidence. Particularly because, at present, trastuzumabâ€™s (Herceptin) licensing means it is only available to be used alongside chemotherapy and not alone. All cancer patients deserve access to clinically effective treatments.â€\\x9d Trial co-leader Prof Judith Bliss, director of the clinical trials and statistics unit at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: â€œIt was unexpected to see quite such dramatic responses to the trastuzumab and lapatinib within 11 days. â€œOur results are a strong foundation on which to build further trials of combination anti-HER2 therapies prior to surgery â€“ which could reduce the number of women who require subsequent chemotherapy, which is also very effective but can lead to long-term side effects.â€\\x9d The trial, led by researchers from Manchester University, the University Hospital of South Manchester NHS foundation trust and the Institute of Cancer Research, studied 257 women with HER2 positive breast cancer in the short gap between their initial diagnosis and surgery to remove their tumours. Initially women were randomised to receive either trastuzamab or lapatinib or no treatment. Halfway through the trial, after evidence from other trials of the effectiveness of the combination, the design was changed so that additional women allocated to the lapatinib group were also prescribed trastuzumab. Of the women receiving both, 17% had only minimal residual disease â€“ defined as an invasive tumour smaller than 5mm in size â€“ and 11% had no biological sign of invasive tumour in the breast. Of the women treated with trastuzumab only, 3% had residual disease or complete response. HER2 positive breast cancer is more likely to come back after treatment than some other types of breast cancer. It is generally treated with surgery, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted anti-HER2 drugs. Current treatments are effective, and complete response is common after three to four months, but observing a disease response so quickly took the researchers by surprise. In the UK, around 53,000 women a year are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and in 10% to 15% of these cases it is HER2 positive breast cancer. Around 11,500 women die from the disease every year. Herceptin was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) 10 years ago after pressure from patients. Lapatinib has not been approved and so is not routinely available on the NHS due to its expense. According to Cancer Research UK, current treatments are effective, and women often experience a complete response after three to four months. Nevertheless, researchers said the 11-day response was very surprising. Prof Arnie Purushotham, senior clinical adviser at Cancer Research UK, said: â€œThese results are very promising if they stand up in the long run and could be the starting step of finding a new way to treat HER2 positive breast cancers. â€œThis could mean some women can avoid chemotherapy after their surgery â€“ sparing them the side-effects and giving them a better quality of life.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Love through a lens: how Ingrid Bergman took the worldâ€™s breath away Nearly 20 years ago, I went to stay with my husband in a house owned by the family of Roberto Rossellini, the great neorealist Italian film director. We spent our days as you do when you find yourself in an idyllic hideaway in the Italian sunshine: reading; lying by the pool; watching the light through the trees. And I thought about Ingrid Bergman, who must have visited this secluded villa at a time when her life was in free fall. Itâ€™s hard now to imagine the kind of scandal Bergman caused when she became pregnant with Rosselliniâ€™s child, while still married to her first husband Petter LindstrÃ¶m. She wasnâ€™t just a wife, she was a mother, and had left her daughter Pia behind when she went off to Italy to work with Rossellini. The outrage was scalding. â€œBergman news jolts Hollywood like an A Bombâ€\\x9d screeched one newspaper headline, neatly combining two of the most important news items of 1949. In the US, religious groups began a campaign to ban her films on the grounds that they glorified adultery. In Italy, she and Rossellini were followed everywhere by paparazzi, their companions for the rest of their tumultuous life together. â€œI was a danger for American womanhood,â€\\x9d she told an interviewer, years later. â€œEven my voice over the radio was supposed to be dangerous. Of course I was hurt, but I didnâ€™t think that what I had done was so much other peopleâ€™s business ... If you donâ€™t like the performance, you can walk out, but to criticise peopleâ€™s private life, I thought was wrong.â€\\x9d That defiant statement of intent is quoted in Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words, a new documentary film directed by Stig BjÃ¶rkman that tells the story of one of Hollywoodâ€™s most enduring stars. It draws on her diaries, letters and interviews, interspersed with home movies, and glimpses of the actor in all her screen glory, from her Swedish debut in 1935 to her Hollywood heyday in the 1940s to her final roles nearly 40 years later. It is a revealing insight into a woman who consistently defied expectations. In her first American screen test, in bleached-out colour and silence, â€œwith no makeupâ€\\x9d as the clapper board proclaims, she shines. It is as if she is in possession of a secret and that knowledge illuminates her from the inside, as she glances directly at the camera, or smiles with a warmth that could thaw a Swedish winter. Itâ€™s a sign of all that is to come. If you think of Bergman on screen, in Casablanca, Notorious or Gaslight, it is that radiance that first comes to mind. In part this was a simple matter of her beauty. Daniel Selznick, son of the powerful David O who first swept Bergman away to Hollywood, told her biographer Charlotte Chandler: â€œThere is no one I have ever met, of any age, of any generation, that took oneâ€™s breath away at every meeting the way she did. The complexion, the lips, the cheeks, the ears, the nose, the eyes, the body of a goddess. And she was just completely unselfconscious.â€\\x9d Gregory Peck, her co-star in Hitchockâ€™s Spellbound, suggested that she was even more beautiful away from the studio cameras â€“ a judgment vindicated by the home movie footage that shows her relaxed with family and friends. But there is some other mysterious force at work. From the very first, she was confident in front of a camera, and it is Pia LindstrÃ¶m â€“ the daughter she abandoned when she ran off with Rossellini â€“ who offers a psychological explanation for her motherâ€™s dazzling impact on screen. Bergmanâ€™s mother had died when she was two, so she was brought up by her father, a photographer, whom she adored, until he too died when she was 13. â€œLove would come right through that lens,â€\\x9d suggests LindstrÃ¶m. â€œShe was looking through that lens and she is looking at her dear dead father, and she would flirt and play with him and pose with him. She was completely comfortable with the camera and knew how to pose.â€\\x9d Bergman herself was aware of her gift. She was a poor little orphan girl, lonely and bereft, yet filming made her feel alive. Thereâ€™s a photograph of her going to her first ever job as an extra that is notable not only for her staggering loveliness, but for the sheer vitality of her pose as she peers along the line of waiting hopefuls, looking outwards and forwards. â€œI love the freedom I feel in front of the camera,â€\\x9d she said. But she was a dab hand behind a camera, too, inheriting from her father a desire to record the world and the people around her. She filmed her honeymoon with Petter, and when she left him suddenly she wrote saying she didnâ€™t want many of the â€œtreasuresâ€\\x9d she had left behind. â€œThe only problem will be our 16mm film. Maybe you will lend it to me so I can see what I looked like in my youth.â€\\x9d That desire to preserve each aspect of her life in photographs and footage has left BjÃ¶rkman a wealth of material on which to draw; in this private footage you see her falling in love with Rossellini, stroking his head tenderly as they talk; you watch the three children they had together grow up; you see their fear as their parentsâ€™ marriage falls apart. Later, you watch the sadness cross Bergmanâ€™s face as she climbs into an ambulance when her daughter Isabella is diagnosed with scoliosis. But just as revealing are the letters and diaries that Bergman also preserved, rich in self-knowledge and the honest confrontation of the contradictions in her character. Writing to a friend, when she is enjoying the first flush of success in her Hollywood career, she describes her panic at not working for four months â€œwhich is two months too longâ€\\x9d. She is at home with Petter and Pia, but confesses: â€œOnly half of me is alive. The other half is packed away in a suitcase suffocating. What should I do?â€\\x9d She has an affair with Robert Capa, the war photographer, and her free spirit soars. She tries to be a good wife and to knit at home, but the siren call of something different propels her onwards. With Rossellini, it is his work she falls in love with first; she admires Rome, Open City and writes him a bold proposal. â€œIf you ever need a Swedish actor who speaks very good English and a little German, who can make herself understood in French and can only say â€˜ti amoâ€™ in Italian, then Iâ€™ll come and make a film with you.â€\\x9d Years later she explains his appeal more fully. â€œIt was a combination of passion that I fell in love with a man who was so different from any other man I had ever known, and it was my boredom in Hollywood â€“ I wanted to do something that they didnâ€™t expect me to do.â€\\x9d When her relationship with Rossellini broke down, and she began to think about returning to Hollywood, she was still determined â€œto do the kind of films I feel comfortable withâ€\\x9d. Success mattered greatly to Bergman, but not at any price. At the same time, as the film makes clear, though her children mattered to her intensely, she was prepared to leave them to pursue her career. Her priorities were not those expected. â€œIf you took acting away from me I would stop breathing,â€\\x9d she said. She admitted she had missed a lot, by leaving not just one child but her second set of children to be brought up mainly by others. â€œI do regret it, but I donâ€™t think they suffered,â€\\x9d she said. That complexity â€“ the authentic voice of a woman who knew her own fallibility, of someone who loved and lost but never complained â€“ makes Bergman, who died of cancer, aged 67, in 1982, a peculiarly admirable Hollywood star. She was a pioneer before her time; protected and constrained by her loveliness, she voyaged ever onwards, brave and strong. There is a rose named after her, which I have in my garden. It is deep red, lightly perfumed and almost too perfect in shape and form. It blooms for a very long time, lingering long after other flowers shed their petals. There could not be a better tribute to an actor who is always worth remembering. â€¢ Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words is at the BFI Southbank, London SE1, from 12 August and then at selected cinemas. At the BFI, the film will be accompanied by a mini season, Ingrid Bergman on Screen. bfi.org.uk',\n",
              "  'ECB cuts eurozone interest rate to zero to jump-start economy The European Central Bank has surprised financial markets by cutting interest rates in the eurozone to zero, expanding its money printing programme and reducing a key deposit rate further into negative territory as it seeks to revive the economy and fend off deflation. The ECB chief, Mario Draghi, implied interest rates would stay â€œvery lowâ€\\x9d for at least another year but played down speculation they could be cut even further. Unveiling a bigger package of help for the eurozone than investors had expected, Draghi predicted that inflation in the single currency bloc would remain stuck in negative territory over the coming months and cited a host of risks to economic growth from stumbling emerging economies, volatile financial markets and the slow pace of structural reforms. â€œRates will stay low, very low, for a long period of time and well past the horizon of our purchases,â€\\x9d Draghi said, referring to the ECBâ€™s quantitative easing (QE) programme, where the bank pumps money into the European economy by buying bonds from banks, which is expected to run until at least March 2017. But asked at a news conference how low the ECB could go on interest rates, he said: â€œFrom todayâ€™s perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we donâ€™t anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. Of course, new facts can change the situation and the outlook.â€\\x9d Going further than economists had expected, the Frankfurt-based ECB cut the eurozoneâ€™s main interest rate from 0.05% to zero, initially prompting a sharp drop in the euro against the pound and the dollar. As part of a package of measures to revive lending and economic activity in the eurozone, the central bank cut its two other interest rates, expanded QE and announced new ultra-cheap four-year loans to banks, allowing them to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates. On currency markets, there were big swings in the euro as traders sought to establish if the ECB had now exhausted its options or if more stimulus was still to come. On stock markets, share prices were boosted when the rate cuts were announced but gains were cut as Draghi suggested there was no additional help to come. Economists said the package of measures announced was more than had been expected. â€œThe European Central Bank announced a broad attack on below-target inflation, using all monetary policy tools at once to boost the economy and increase inflation,â€\\x9d said Tomas Holinka, economist at economic researchers Moodyâ€™s Analytics. â€œWhile the bank has revealed its policy instruments step by step in the past, now it announced all of them â€“ cutting the interest rates, expanding the QE programme and providing long-term liquidity â€“ together.â€\\x9d George Efstathopoulos, portfolio manager at fund manager Fidelity International, commented: â€œThis is a bold stance from Draghi and the ECB, which should be positive for both financial markets but more importantly the real economy.â€\\x9d As expected by markets, the deposit rate was cut by 10 basis points, further into negative territory to -0.4%. The latest cut in the deposit rate means the ECB will be charging banks more to hold their money overnight, with the aim of encouraging them to lend it to businesses. The marginal lending rate, paid by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight, was cut from 0.3% to to 0.25%. The ECB expanded QE to â‚¬80bn (Â£61bn) a month, up from â‚¬60bn. That was more than the â‚¬70bn economists had been expecting, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. The programme will now include buying bonds issued by companies and not just by financial institutions. The ECB had come under growing pressure to increase support for the eurozoneâ€™s flagging economy after the single currency bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February. But the latest moves come amid growing scepticism on financial markets that central banks have enough ammunition left to bolster growth and stop falling prices becoming entrenched. The ECB itself is now predicting inflation in the eurozone will be just 0.1% this year, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 - all under its target for inflation close to but below 2%. Draghi echoed comments by his UK counterpart, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, that governments cannot leave central banks to do all the work on driving the economic recovery. Draghi said: â€œMonetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively.â€\\x9d Those comments reflected evidence that â€œthe effectiveness of monetary policy is clearly diminishingâ€\\x9d, said Alasdair Cavalla at the consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research. â€œDraghi threw down the gauntlet to fiscal policymakers, arguing for infrastructure spending while lowering the ECBâ€™s own growth forecasts,â€\\x9d said Cavalla. Against that backdrop of bleaker growth prospects and falling prices, Draghi had already indicated the central bank would announce fresh stimulus at the conclusion of this weekâ€™s policy-setting meeting. Economists had widely expected the ECB to expand QE and cut the deposit rate so the reduction of the main interest rate and the marginal lending rate caught markets off-guard. Alex Edwards, analyst at currency transfer company UKForex, said: â€œThe ECB has delivered nothing more than dovish news. Rates were cut, inflation forecasts slashed and an extra $20bn announced in quantitative easing. Draghi has not left many stones unturned, and the fact he announced this all at once sent the euro spiralling downwards. â€œThe euro has been extremely volatile since Draghi spoke, and bounced back as quickly as it fell after he also hinted that rates may now be at their bottom. Itâ€™s going to be a very bumpy ride for the euro into the end of the week.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'HSBC escapes action by City regulator following Swiss tax scandal HSBC will not face formal action from the City regulator following revelations that the Swiss arm of Britainâ€™s biggest bank helped clients to evade tax. HSBC was engulfed in scandal a year ago when leaked bank account details showed how the bankâ€™s Swiss unit helped wealthy customers to dodge taxes by concealing assets and handing out bundles of cash to avoid the authorities. At the time, the Financial Conduct Authority said it was looking at the working practices inside the bank after admitting it had learned about the details of the activities in the Swiss bank from the reports in the and other publications. However, the FCA has now concluded that review and will not take formal action against HSBC. The FCA would not comment on the decision, first reported by Sky News, butit said in February 2015 that the leak of the bank account details â€œhas served to reinforce the importance of firms operating with the right culture across all of their operationsâ€\\x9d. Martin Wheatley, the then chief executive of the FCA, said: â€œThe allegations are about a Swiss unit of the bank, based on events of predominantly 2005-2007 ... We are very closely monitoring the ability of the bank overall â€¦ and we think significant improvements have been madeâ€\\x9d. Wheatley resigned in July when George Osborne did not renew his contract, sparking speculation that the chancellor wanted to take a softer stance towards the City. A successor for Wheatley has not been named and the regulator ended 2015 facing criticism of its decision to end a review of culture at banks that had been outlined in its business plan earlier in the year. HSBC, which declined to comment on Monday, has repeatedly said it has changed its practices, including an overhaul of its structure that began in 2011. Last year, the Geneva authorities instructed HSBC to pay a record 40m Swiss francs (Â£28m) for â€œorganisational deficienciesâ€\\x9d. A month ago, HervÃ© Falciani, an IT expert, was sentenced to five years in prison by a Swiss court for aggravated industrial espionage, data theft and violation of commercial and banking secrecy. Falciani was convicted in his absence and did not attend the trial. HSBC is currently reviewing whether to keep its headquarters in the UK, where it has been based since the early 1990s following the takeover of Midland Bank. The outcome is expected early this year. The bank has published 11 factors it will consider during the review, which include the governmentâ€™s tax policy and attitude to financial services companies. The FCA decision emerged as the bankâ€™s UK arm â€“ which has 17 million customers â€“ tweeted on Monday that people were having problems logging on to online and mobile banking services. Towards the end of the day, it tweeted: â€œPersonal banking customers should now be able to access the mobile app, although we continue to work on a fix for desktop usersâ€\\x9d. It is the latest IT problem for a big bank. On New Yearâ€™s Day, Royal Bank of Scotlandâ€™s customers had problems using their debit cards in shops.',\n",
              "  'Shapeshifter Antonio Conte stamps his dynamic personality on Chelsea For Chelsea fans, or indeed anyone with an interest in the high-rev methods of Antonio Conte, there was a slightly alarming moment as the Premier League international break arrived at the start of October. Conte announced he would be going to Italy to rest. He was already exhausted. OK, then. Just the 31 league games, two domestic cups, one transfer window and 10-15 miles of febrile touchline sprints left to go this season. What could possibly go wrong from here? It is understandable Conte should have arrived in west London less than refreshed given his summer at Euro 2016, the burdens of starting a major job and his own full-body absorption in the process: the hair-tearing grief at every setback, the tendency to celebrate each high with uncontained, eye-popping joy, haring about like a man who has just struck oil beneath his patio decking or made the first ever recorded discovery of chocolate ice cream. In reality Conte is simply a manager who works best coiled tight and always on the edge. In this respect he looks a pretty good fit for a Premier League season where top spot has changed hands nine times and where the ability to cajole a cohesive whole out of a new-ish group of players while simultaneously sliding down the banisters and performing complex calculus on an abacus is likely to decide the destiny of an open title race. With just under a third of the season gone four points separate the top five teams, all of whom have a reasonable chance of going on to win it. Beyond this the league is unusually interesting in a tactical sense, with a shared attempt at the top to marry technical players and positional fluidity with a full-throttle physicality that feels quite English in its unquestioning intensity. As Conte nipped off for a lie-down at the start of October there was a view in these pages that any team finishing ahead of Liverpool at the end of the season would do so â€œbloodied and blistered and breathlessâ€\\x9d. Six weeks on the latest club to take up the slack at the front of the peloton are Chelsea, to whom the same reasoning might now be applied. Chelseaâ€™s current run of six league wins without conceding a goal has its roots in Conteâ€™s bold shift of shape in September. The early attempts at a 4-2-4 had already begun to elide into a 4-3-3. Defeat by Arsenal brought some soul-searching and a more profound change to 3-4-3, with Cesc FÃ bregas discarded and the roles of three key players clarified with thrilling results. At which point, enter David Luiz, defensive giant. Yes, that David Luiz, a player who has had a peculiar double-life, damned by his own relentlessly trumpeted mistakes and at the same time rewarded with ever more extravagant playing contracts. During the last World Cup in Brazil there was an airline advert that featured a zanily grinning David Luiz in full pilotâ€™s outfit proudly inviting you to board his waiting jet, arguably the least reassuring passenger safety message ever devised. And yet he has been key to Chelseaâ€™s recent stability, not just as a deep playmaker at the heart of that three but as the aggressive, spirited defensive leader he has always been in between the odd horrific performance. Aged 29 now, the only major club football medal to escape the worldâ€™s most expensive defender across European three countries is - so far - a Premier League title medal. Which is fairly steady going for a man routinely dismissed as a flake and a saboteur. Further upfield Eden Hazard has been liberated by the 3-4-3, allowed to operate in forward gear by a manager who has accepted his lack of cover rather than simply fuming at it like a disappointed stepdad. In 12 league games Hazard has made 52 successful dribbles, compared with 89 the whole of last season. He should pass his total of 36 shots in the whole of 2015-16 against Tottenham on Saturday. Against that Hazard has made just four tackles. But Chelsea are top, and their best player has rediscovered his lateral spring, the ability to take the ball and turn in a single movement. Victor Moses, high-class wing-back, has been the most obvious gain. Moses is also the epitome of a common trait among the insurgent Conte-Klopp-Guardiola managerial type, the ability to make good use of the things that they find, recycling some talented but dormant part into a key component. Like James Milnerâ€™s fine turn at left-back, or Guardiolaâ€™s tweaking of key creative midfielders, Moses has been Conteâ€™s own Womble-player, an itinerant winger and No10 across five English clubs before the age of 25 but now in the best period of his career as a powerful and utterly committed right wing-back. The sudden surge of eviscerating form, sparked by a decisive switch of shape, is nothing new in a Conte team. There are parallels with his first season at Juventus in 2011-12, where 14 of his first 27 Serie A matches were drawn but Juve ended up winning the title unbeaten in the league. Conte had been desperate to fit the thrillingly energetic Arturo Vidal into his team. In late September Vidal finally made the starting XI, Juve ran through Milan in Turin, a new 4-3-3 shape was up and running and Conte was on his way to a hat-trick of titles. As with Juve that year the lack of European football looks a significant advantage for Chelsea. There is an idea that the major plus here is to do with fatigue or injury, but managers talk instead of simply having those extra two days to plan and drill their players. Such is the way of the modern coach. In contract with the old Alex Ferguson-era idea of momentum, winning teams rolling on with the same system, combinations ever-more grooved under pressure, it is the interventionist, hands-in-the-cake-mix tendencies of the modern breed that stand out. Conte is obsessed with the fitness and physicality of his players, talking constantly with his medical staff, brooding over sprockets and hinges like an F1 pit boss, shifting his team on reports of twinges and twangs. Similarly the hands-on nature of Jurgen Kloppâ€™s coaching has been noted, the tendency to physically haul players around the training pitch, something Ron Greenwood could be seen doing at West Ham in the 1970s. Kloppâ€™s Liverpool experienced their first little gulp this weekend, as Southampton set out to defend against a slightly depleted team. Like a batsman who comes out and hits a flurry of fours, then has to change gear as the field drops back, Klopp will now look to adjust, to pick up the ones and twos, to hold Liverpoolâ€™s attacking fire for the right moment. No doubt the same process of reeling in and counter-adjustment will hit Chelsea in the coming weeks as opposition managers find a way to get behind the wing-backs or to harry David Luiz as Middlesbrough did on Sunday. Chelseaâ€™s next two opponents are Tottenham and Manchester City. This evolving team may find life less comfortable against similar high-intensity machines, fellow hard-pressers. But a year on from the last days of JosÃ© they can at least be sure they will not fail for want of sheer, thrilling focus.',\n",
              "  'Sa Dingding: The Butterfly Dream review â€“ Chinese folk-electronica fusion for global pop market This should have been an intriguing set. Sa Dingding is one of Chinaâ€™s most successful and unusual artists, a powerful singer who has specialised in reviving Chinese and Mongolian folk themes while mixing traditional instruments with electronica. And the producer of her new album is Karsh Kale, the New York-based tabla player who has worked with Anoushka Shankar. But this is not the China-India sound-clash that it could have been, even though Dingding plays the guzheng zither and morin khuur fiddle, and the Indian musicians include flautist Naveen Kumar and sitar player Azeem Ahmed Alvi. There are some strong songs here, but they are weakened by the overuse of electronica.

              "  'Family rifts over Brexit: â€˜I can barely look at my parentsâ€™ â€˜Iâ€™m worried Brexit has made me ageist,â€\\x9d a friend said, following the shock of the referendum result on Friday morning. â€œI saw this older couple in the street and just felt this sudden, enormous wave of fury towards them and their generation. It was almost physical.â€\\x9d In the immediate aftermath of Britainâ€™s vote to leave the European Union, emotions have been running high. Since YouGov reported that 75% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 56% of 25- to 49-year-olds voted in favour of remain, versus 44% of 50- to 64-year-olds and 39% of those over 65, the extent of the generational gulf between Generation Y and the so-called baby boomers and their parents has been palpable. As has the anger many younger people including my friend, are feeling. Over the past few days, thousands have vented on social media. â€œIâ€™m never giving up my seat on the train for an old person again,â€\\x9d read one tweet. The overwhelming consensus on the part of â€œmillennialsâ€\\x9d (defined as those aged 18-34), has been that, by opting for Brexit, the older generation has selfishly voted against the interests of subsequent ones. What happens if the people voting against your interests were members of your own family: your parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts? Stephanie is 21, from Merseyside, and was visiting her parents for the week of the referendum. â€œRight from the moment I got back I was bombarded with questions about which side I was on and why,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIâ€™m not one to shy away from healthy debate, but my parents completely refused to see things from any point of view but their own, and would deliberately misunderstand my view or rubbish it completely. â€œAfter the leave result, my parents continued to insult and degrade the 48% of us [who voted remain], with my dad at one point getting into an argument with a family friend who is an EU citizen and telling her she â€˜should leave if she loves the EU so muchâ€™. Even when stories of legitimised racism and xenophobia were highlighted, my parents refused to accept this may have been partly because of the leave vote,â€\\x9d she adds. The referendum may have ruined Stephanieâ€™s trip home, but it has shifted her perspective. â€œWhat was supposed to be a nice week turned into a week of being belittled and endless arguments, and I have never felt so insulted by members of my own family before. As much as I love my parents, this referendum has made me see them in a different light â€“ people who are unwilling to listen to the opinions of others and disrespectful of those with legitimate concerns about what their opinion could lead to.â€\\x9d Stephanie is far from being the only young person now seeing her family differently. â€œIâ€™ve been having the most terrible rows with my mum about it, as Iâ€™m so heartbroken by the result,â€\\x9d says Alex. â€œBoth my parents voted to leave despite me begging them not to. I tried to explain the effects it would have on my future, and my childrenâ€™s future â€“ but each time it would just end in the most awful arguments. Now, with the way things are, I feel like I can barely look at them. It sounds melodramatic, but I feel so betrayed by it all.â€\\x9d Some will think Alex is going over the top, but the realisation that your parents may not just have voted against your interests but embody wildly different politics and values from yours can be a bitter pill to swallow. Jamie, 28, grew up in a council flat with a single mother who worked hard to make their difficult life better for her children. â€œIâ€™ve always been so proud of her for all the things she sacrificed for us. Sheâ€™s warm, kind, generous and funny. She has such acute sympathy that sheâ€™s been known to cry hearing about the illness of other peopleâ€™s relatives. Oh, and she also hates immigrants.â€\\x9d It is not a prejudice that Jamie shares. â€œMy mum voted to leave the EU because she doesnâ€™t want non-British citizens here. Despite the fact that my brother and I have been extremely vocal about our reasons for staying in, sheâ€™s chosen to vote out because she doesnâ€™t like the local Asian population. It makes no sense to me. â€œWhen she tells me wildly embellished stories about how disgusting the local peaceful, quiet, mostly elderly immigrant community are, I laugh at her and calmly tell her sheâ€™s wrong. Most of the time, I can see past her views. But right now, Iâ€™m angry and ashamed.â€\\x9d Sarah is also struggling with anti-immigrant sentiments among those close to her. She is the only known remain voter in her family. â€œI grew up in the Midlands on a council estate where many of my relatives still live, so I do wonder if that has something to do with their choice,â€\\x9d she says. â€œIt came to a head post-result, when a relative asked: â€˜How can Remain voters call leave voters â€˜racist?â€™â€\\x9d â€œI had pointed out that sharing EDL, Britain First and BNP posts online [means] people will assume you share those views and are likely to call you a racist, homophobe and a sexist.â€\\x9d After that, things took a nasty turn. â€œIâ€™m no longer engaging with it. My family isnâ€™t impressed I â€˜called my family racistâ€™, and the whole referendum has certainly created a them versus us divide that I donâ€™t think will heal any time soon. I havenâ€™t spoken to any of them since Friday. Itâ€™s a bit sore.â€\\x9d Naturally, not all tales of post-referendum familial disharmony will be so extreme. Where some parents are defiant in their voting choice, for others, a certain amount of guilt is setting in. â€œMy whole family voted leave,â€\\x9d says Emma. â€œMy brother, who is 31, now feels awful about it and wishes he hadnâ€™t even voted at all. My parents have been staunch Eurosceptics their whole lives, and are pleased with the result. But my mum now feels bad about how upset I am; and all of her friendsâ€™ children have been upset, too. We are having very tense conversations. â€œI donâ€™t begrudge her the life that she has had â€“ my parents are homeowners who retired early with nice pensions â€“ because she has worked damn hard for it. Iâ€™m not even angry with her for voting the way she has, because she has a right to her views. I just feel sad about my own future and I canâ€™t pretend that Iâ€™m not. And so she feels bad for making me feel sad, which just keeps going in a never-ending cycle. I feel like we are both hurting and we canâ€™t help each other.â€\\x9d Jo, too, is cut up about her parentsâ€™ decision. â€œMy parents voted out. I was very shocked when I found out how they were voting,â€\\x9d she says. â€œMy parents were anti-Thatcherites, originally from the north-east, and they partially blamed Europe for the loss of industry and jobs in the north. They are not racists and they are degree-educated people who had decided years ago that if the vote ever came up they would vote out. â€œThey felt lied to in the original vote as to what Europe would become. It seemed to be a vote for nostalgia. I had a hard time picking up the phone on Friday, and I think mum was upset as to how distraught I was about the result. She said she never thought it would actually be out and was surprised. I feel like something has died that we canâ€™t get back as a nation.â€\\x9d One woman I speak to is so furious with her uncle for voting leave that she is considering not inviting him to her wedding. â€œI just donâ€™t want anything to do with him at the moment,â€\\x9d she says. â€œMaybe after a few days I will calm down. Then again, maybe not.â€\\x9d From speaking to young people up and down the country, many of whom are now embroiled in rifts with the closest members of their families, it becomes clear that their reactions to the result are not just matters of political principle, but come from a place of profound grief and betrayal. It sounds dramatic but, for many, the heartbreak is total, because of the futures so many feel they have lost. One person I speak to, from west Wales, has spent their entire adult life studying or working on an EU-funded programme across several European countries, and is furious that despite this their mother didnâ€™t even bother to vote. Another, who speaks two EU languages, is working on a third, and dreams of living abroad, is furious. â€œNow, because of petty quibbles with EU practice, my parents have voted away my right to live and work in nearly 30 countries,â€\\x9d she says. â€œEverything Iâ€™ve studied for, for as long as I can remember, has been thrown away over false constructs of sovereignty and lies about immigration. â€œI am presumably one of the citizens who leave voters thought they were winning the country back for. I donâ€™t want their toxic, pathetic little country, it is not mine. If I had anywhere else to go I would burn my passport.â€\\x9d You can imagine how it must feel, to invest so much of your young adult life into the European project, only to have your parents undermine it. â€œHow could they do this?â€\\x9d is the phrase that comes up again and again. Some tell me they are leaving the Labour party, dismayed at what they perceive as Jeremy Corbynâ€™s failure to passionately fight for the EU they so love, or are moving to Scotland and plan to vote SNP, and several mention the Lib Demsâ€™ promise to campaign to reverse the decision if there is a snap general election. Whatever happens, there is a huge swell of political support among young people for remaining in the EU that clever politicians could potentially galvanise. In the meantime, young people are reflecting on the fact that you only get one adult life, and itâ€™s one that politicians and parents alike have gambled with. â€œIâ€™m ashamed of my own mother,â€\\x9d says Jamie. â€œItâ€™s a horrible feeling. Iâ€™m incredibly angry that she didnâ€™t consider the future of her young children who are just starting out in the world. â€œWeâ€™re graduates, starting our careers and beginning postgraduate studies. Weâ€™re newlyweds and nearlyweds, looking for our first homes and who will be starting families in the next 10 years. But when our mum voted, she chose to ignore that, driven by her hate for foreigners, rather than love for her own children. Sheâ€™s sacrificed a lot in life to give us the best chances but now, with one little cross in a box, sheâ€™s undone all the good she did for us. I just donâ€™t understand why she didnâ€™t listen to her children before she voted.â€\\x9d Not all young people voted to remain, of course. Emily, 26, voted leave, while her mum, dad and grandad all voted remain. â€œMy mum hung up the phone on me when she found out my younger sister and I had voted leave. Dad said he was devastated at the result, and my granddad, a second world war veteran, initially told me he was worried for a future he wouldnâ€™t see.â€\\x9d Her younger sister, who is a student, also voted leave. â€œBeing young, both my sister and I felt we were at the sharp end of the economic crash. Sheâ€™s saddled with Â£9,000-a-year tuition fees she didnâ€™t have any say about, and set to work under the dreaded junior doctor contact in a decimated NHS. Iâ€™m still paying nearly half my income in rent. We wanted something to give. Mum and Dad are second-home owners. Grandad has been retired longer than he has worked. The system worked for them. Now the economic reality is beginning to set in, Iâ€™m not sure if I made the right decision. Mum says we all make bad choices, she voted for Thatcher in 79, and she forgives me. Grandad says not to worry, nothing will be as bad as the Great Depression he grew up in. When he was a child, he was so hungry he ate acorns for dinner and had no shoes. People nowadays need to toughen up, he says. Itâ€™ll be OK in the end.â€\\x9d â€¢ All names have been changed',\n",
              "  \"Demand mounts for Trump Apprentice tapes that may hold 'far worse' footage The repercussions were swift following last Fridayâ€™s leak of the Access Hollywood tape, in which Donald Trump can be heard bragging about sexually assaulting women: House speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republicans that he would no longer defend the partyâ€™s nominee, while hordes of party members distanced themselves from Trumpâ€™s comments with some â€“ including Senator John McCain â€“ even saying they could no longer vote for Trump. Supposedly, things could get even worse for the Republican nominee. Following the release of the footage by the Washington Post, Bill Pruitt, a producer on the first two seasons of The Apprentice, the NBC reality show Trump hosted from 2004-2015, tweeted that there are â€œfar worseâ€\\x9d behind-the-scenes tapes of Trump on the program. Emmy award-winning producer Chris Nee has alleged that Trump says the n-word in the recordings. In light of the allegations, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, which owns the rights to the show, and The Apprentice creator Mark Burnett are facing mounting pressure to make public the footage. But on Monday, MGM and Burnett said in a joint statement to the , that they do â€œnot have the ability nor the rightâ€\\x9d to release the material, citing â€œvarious contractual and legal requirementsâ€\\x9d. MGM and Burnett also refuted allegations that staffers have been threatened with legal action for releasing the outtakes, stating that: â€œthe recent claims that Mark Burnett has threatened anyone with litigation if they were to leak such material are completely and unequivocally false.â€\\x9d Burnett â€œhas consistently supported Democratic campaignsâ€\\x9d, the statement said. In past presidential cycles, he has been a prominent donor to Democratic candidates and the Democratic National Committee. But leaking The Apprentice tapes comes for an alleged asking price of $5.1m â€“ needed to cover the potential penalty fee for breaking Burnettâ€™s non-disclosure agreement. With mounting interest surrounding The Apprentice footage, the Huffington Post on Tuesday published an in-depth report on how Comedy Centralâ€™s 2011 Roast of Donald Trump came together, displaying yet more misogynistic remarks by Trump. Still, The Apprentice leak is sure to be more destructive. Rumors of the footage has spurred UltraViolet Action, a group committed to â€œexpose and fight sexismâ€\\x9d, to post a petition calling on MGM and NBC to release the tapes and â€œstop protecting Donald Trumpâ€\\x9d. The form was signed by more than 30,000 people in less than four hours after it went live on Monday afternoon. By Tuesday morning, that number rose to 115,000 according to the organization. Actor and activist Mark Ruffalo is among those who have joined the cause, tweeting his support for the petition. Additionally, A GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign was launched on Sunday, with the goal of raising $5m to â€œreward the whistleblower responsibleâ€\\x9d to â€œassist them as they move forward in their careerâ€\\x9d. â€œAny unused funds (or if no one comes forward) will be donated to a reputable organization that supports freedom of the press and journalistic integrity,â€\\x9d reads the Trump Sunlight Campaign page. So far the campaign has amassed more than $20,000. David Brock, a Hillary Clinton ally who runs a network of Democratic groups to help her campaign, including Media Matters, has also promised he would back the leaker financially. â€œTime is of the essence,â€\\x9d urges Karin Roland, chief campaigns officer for UltraViolet Action. â€œI know that MGM has said that there are contractual reasons for withholding the tapes, but thatâ€™s not acceptable. Every day and every hour is time that MGM and Mark Burnett are keeping the truth about the man who wants to be president from voters â€“ and thatâ€™s totally unacceptable.â€\\x9d â€œThe reality is MGM and Burnett have profited off of Trumpâ€™s brand and now theyâ€™re protecting who he is from the public, in particular from women voters,â€\\x9d Roland adds. â€œThe American public deserves to know.â€\\x9d MGM and Burnettâ€™s response comes a week after the Associated Press released an in-depth report of Trumpâ€™s behavior on the NBC show, which he hosted from 2004 to early 2015, in which more than 20 contestants and crew members from The Apprentice shared on-and-off the record accounts of his allegedly lewd behavior. Randal Pinkett, who won the competition in December 2005, told the AP he remembered Trump talking about which female contestants he wanted to sleep with, even though Trump had married former model Melania Knauss earlier that year: â€œHe was like â€˜Isnâ€™t she hot, check her out,â€™ kind of gawking, something to the effect of â€˜Iâ€™d like to hit that.â€™â€\\x9d Former producer Katherine Walker said Trump speculated about which female contestant would be â€œa tiger in bedâ€\\x9d. The Trump campaign denied the claims, calling them â€œoutlandishâ€\\x9d and â€œunsubstantiatedâ€\\x9d. On Monday, the Huffington Post obtained a transcript from the ninth season of The Apprentice where contestants were tasked with giving three country music stars a makeover. During a boardroom session to present their transformations, Trump reportedly made a series of comments on singer Emily Westâ€™s physical appearance, specifically her skin, saying: â€œI assume youâ€™re gonna leave this off, donâ€™t put this shit on the show, you know. But her skin, her skin sucks, okay? I mean her skin, she needs some serious fuckinâ€™ dermatology.â€\\x9d Trump was fired from hosting The Apprentice by NBC in 2015 after making controversial comments about Mexican immigrants while launching his campaign for president. Heâ€™s been replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger for an upcoming season. The former Republican governor of California has since distanced himself from Trump, retracting his support following the Access Hollywood leak. â€œIt is not only acceptable to choose your country over your party â€“ it is your duty,â€\\x9d he said in a statement.\",\n",
              "  \"Genius by numbers: why Hollywood maths movies don't add up In the Tina Fey sitcom Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, wealthy Manhattanite Jacqueline Vorhees wails to her assistant that she canâ€™t afford to get divorced. Even though sheâ€™d get $1m for every year of her marriage. â€œI spend 100 grand a month. Iâ€™ll be broke in 10 years,â€\\x9d she wails. â€œNo, thatâ€™s wrong,â€\\x9d counters Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who scribbles some sums with a marker on Mrs Vorheesâ€™s window. â€œSo $100,000 times 12 months. Thatâ€™s $1.2m a year. Divide that into $12m, and yes, youâ€™d be broke in 10 years. But if you invest some of it, assuming a 7% rate of return, using the compound interest formula, your money would almost double.â€\\x9d Kimmy turns round triumphantly: â€œMrs Voorhees, I mathed, and you can get divorced!â€\\x9d Mrs Vorhees eyes Kimmy narrowly. â€œThose are not,â€\\x9d she complains, â€œerasable markers.â€\\x9d What she doesnâ€™t mention is that math isnâ€™t a verb. Not yet. The scene is, among other things, Feyâ€™s satire of the Hollywood cliche of genius squiggling on glass. In A Beautiful Mind (2001), for instance, Russell Crowe, playing troubled maths star John Forbes Nash Jr, writes formulae on his dorm window. This scene is echoed in The Social Network (2010), where Andrew Garfield sets out the equations for Facebookâ€™s business model on a Harvard window while Jesse Eisenbergâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg looks on. In the opening scene of Good Will Hunting (1997), janitor prodigy Matt Damon writes equations on a bathroom mirror. Why do so many Hollywood maths whizzes forego paper? Stanford mathematician Keith Devlin explains. â€œDepicting a mathematician scribbling formulas on a sheet of paper might be more accurate, but it certainly doesnâ€™t convey the image of a person passionately involved in mathematics, as does seeing someone write those formulas in steam on a mirror or in wax on a window, nor is it as cinematographically dramatic.â€\\x9d Good point. When we watch A Beautiful Mind and look through the window at our Russ, Hollywoodâ€™s most built mathematician (counterexamples on postcards, please show your workings), we pass beyond incomprehensible equations and convince ourselves weâ€™re seeing Genius at Work. Even if, as some critics have complained uncharitably, Russâ€™s pi glyphs, greater-than and less-than symbols and such donâ€™t make sense. But thereâ€™s another way maths movies can confound the Boredom Equation, namely by leaving a black hole where the maths should be. The Man Who Knew Infinity, the new film starring Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons about the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, is intriguing in this respect. Although we see Ramanujan doing maths, mostly the film is interested in other things â€“ how he falls in love with his wife, the pain of separation when he travels from Madras to study at Cambridge, the racism he suffers in England and, most stirringly, the narrative arc from lowly clerk to globally recognised mathematician. That said, the film has its charming moments. When Hardy visits Ramanujan in a nursing home, he complains about the boring number of the cab that brought him there. Ramanujan begs to differ: 1,729 is the smallest that is expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. Today 1,729 is known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number. How does that work, you may be wondering? Like this: 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103. Ramanujanâ€™s mentor GH Hardy (Irons) is an atheist and rationalist, exasperated that this Indian prodigy cannot produce proofs for his work and, worse, is doubtful that proofs can explain the inexplicable. â€œYou wanted to know how I get my ideas,â€\\x9d says Ramanujan. â€œGod speaks to me.â€\\x9d But while the film may sketch two different mathematical philosophies, we leave the cinema with a warm glow that comes from anything but hard thinking. If you want to learn some more about Ramanujanâ€™s contribution to mathematics, rent High School Musical. Freeze-frame it at the moment brainy Gabriella Montez challenges her teacher. On the board are two of the equations of the inverse of the constant pi (1/Ï€) that Ramanujan offered in his first paper published in England. â€œShouldnâ€™t the second equation read 16 over pi?â€\\x9d asks Gabriella. Of course it should. Cinema often struggles with dramatising difficult ideas, particularly if they are abstract. One way of overcoming that problem is by metaphorical explanation. For instance, in Nicholas Roegâ€™s Insignificance (1985), a Marilyn Monroe-like character demonstrates relativity using toy trains and flashing lights. In The Theory of Everything, Jane Hawking uses a pea and a potato to explain the difference between quantum theory and general relativity, while her husbandâ€™s friends explain Hawking Radiation with beers and crisps. Movie explanations of difficult stuff, though, may obscure rather than enlighten. Whatâ€™s more, some directors know this and have fun pointing out the shortcomings of their medium â€“ and those of their audiences. In Adam McKayâ€™s The Big Short (2016), for instance, Margot Robbie sits in a tub sipping champagne and describing how sub-prime loans work. Her explanation is doubtless coherent, but when Iâ€™m looking at a beautiful woman in a bubble bath, Iâ€™m not thinking about credit default swaps. So sue me. Later in the film, chef Anthony Bourdain chops fish in his kitchen while describing how collateralised debt obligations work. Finally, Selena Gomez plays roulette to illustrate the idea of gambling on other peopleâ€™s gambles. Each scene serves as a parody of explanation. They are part of a film that mocks you, you poor jerk, and your intellectual aspirations. You are never ever going to understand how difficult stuff works from watching movies, however much youâ€™d like to. Sometimes, though, cinema can give a real insight into the intellectual process. In Agora (2009), Rachel Weisz as ancient philosopher Hypatia does an experiment on a ship to test relative motion. If, she hypothesises, you drop a heavy sack from the mast while the ship is moving forward, it will fall on the deck several feet behind the mast. The sack is dropped and falls much closer to the mast than she predicted. Hypatia claps her hands in delight. â€œBut you were wrong!â€\\x9d says the shipâ€™s captain. â€œYes, but it is definitive proof! The sack behaves as if the boat were stationary.â€\\x9d â€œWhat does that mean?â€\\x9d â€œI donâ€™t know. But the same principle could be applied to the Earth. It could be moving around the sun without us realising.â€\\x9d Hypatia, that is to say, infers a revolutionary heliocentric cosmology from her falsified hypothesis. The film thus generously gives us what we are effectively denied in Good Will Hunting or A Beautiful Mind â€“ the inside track on how someone clever is thinking about a problem. Whatâ€™s more, itâ€™s an antidote to Hollywoodâ€™s vision of genius. It suggests that getting stuff wrong is at least as important in the story of human intellectual progress as being right all the time. Maths is often reduced to nothing more than a MacGuffin. In Rushmore (1998), for instance, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is reading the newspaper while his teacher tells his class that on the blackboard is the hardest geometry equation in the world. What credits would anyone solving it get, asks one student. â€œWell, considering Iâ€™ve never seen anyone get it right, including my mentor Dr Leaky at MIT, I guess if anyone here can solve that problem, Iâ€™d see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives.â€\\x9d Thus tempted, Fischer folds his paper and goes to the blackboard, and squiggles his solution while nonchalantly sipping espresso. The film at this point has nothing to declare but Fischerâ€™s genius. Do we really believe Jason Schwartzmann can compute the area of an ellipse? Sure. Whatever. Genius squiggling is there once again merely to help Hollywood tell the sentimental story it never tires of: namely the story of someone â€“ usually borderline demented and by definition insufficiently recognised â€“ sticking it to the establishment. None of this should suggest we canâ€™t learn maths from movies. In Tina Feyâ€™s Mean Girls (2004), for example, Lindsay Lohan plays a finalist in the Illinois high school mathletes state championship. Will her North Shore High team stick it to those prep school toffs opposite? Hereâ€™s the first question: â€œTwice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71. What are the numbers?â€\\x9d Got it yet? 14 and 5. In the end, Lohanâ€™s team become the new state champs because she wins the sudden death tie-break. What does the scene prove? That those of you who thought Lindsay Lohan canâ€™t do maths should really have a word with yourselves. Perhaps the most resonant maths scene in Hollywood cinema, though, comes in a very old comedy. In the Abbott and Costello movie In the Navy (1941), Lou is a shipâ€™s cook. Heâ€™s baked 28 doughnuts, which he reckons is just enough to give 13 to each of his seven officers. But seven goes into 28 four times, objects Louâ€™s straight man. Not so, says Lou, who goes on to prove it on the blackboard in a masterclass of cheating and illusion. The scene demonstrates a general truth, namely that when Hollywood does maths, it doesnâ€™t necessarily add up. â€¢ The Man Who Knew Infinity is released on 8 April.\",\n",
              "  \"Deutsche Bank: Germany's financial colossus stumbles Deutsche Bank fuelled Germanyâ€™s rise to the status of economic powerhouse, financing its industry in the 19th century and helping the countryâ€™s economy to rise again from the rubble of the second world war. It took on the giants of Wall Street in the postwar globalised economy and survived the 2008 banking crisis without a bailout. Such is its stature that in 2008 Angela Merkel organised a special 60th birthday party, with a dinner of fresh asparagus and veal schnitzel, for its then head, Josef Ackermann, at her chancellery. But now as the institution enters its 146th year, questions are being raised about how it will reinvent itself in a banking landscape that is undergoing seismic change as a result of regulatory change and fears of a global economic downturn. The bank has turned to a 55-year-old Briton, John Cryan, to try to carve out a vision for its future and its 100,000 employees. But Cryan â€“ taking the extraordinary step of declaring Deutsche â€œrock solidâ€\\x9d â€“ has spent the last 72 hours trying to calm concerns about its financial health after a dramatic plunge in its share price that, even after a 10% rise on Wednesday, is still down more than 30% in the first six weeks of 2016. After announcing the bankâ€™s first full-year loss since the 2008 crisis last month, Cryanâ€™s bank has become the focus of anxiety about the health of the global financial system, and its woes are raising questions about Germanyâ€™s reputation as a haven of financial stability. Experts suggest that the countryâ€™s entire banking system would have to be redesigned in order to save its standard-bearer. According to JÃ¶rg Rocholl, president of Berlinâ€™s European school of management and technology, â€œthere is no other country in the world in which a bank has a similarly central role as Deutsche Bank has in Germanyâ€\\x9d. Christopher Wheeler, banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Deutsche had resembled the UKâ€™s Barclays: an investment bank and large lender to big businesses with a retail banking arm. But it is now attempting to cast off its retail business â€“ Postbank, which it only acquired in 2010 â€“ raising questions about how it will generate revenues in the future. Attempts to spin off Postbank are proving troublesome and a report on Wednesday suggested that Deutsche would have to write down the value of the business by a third to â‚¬2.8bn (Â£2.2bn) before it could proceed any further. Add to that concerns about the potential bill from litigation and fines. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have forecast another â‚¬3.9bn of charges in 2016 and 2017. â€œIt is also possible the litigation may not be resolved until 2017, leaving uncertainty on the stock,â€\\x9d the analysts said. They cite â€œunresolved litigation which the market struggles to book-end, weak capital generation and need for capital raising actionsâ€\\x9d. Cryan â€“ who has already announced plans to reduce the workforce by a quarter â€“ took on a bank that had been rocked by scandals, including a record Â£1.7bn fine for rigging the Libor interest rate, which sparked accusations it had been obstructive towards regulators. He has described the task ahead of him like mowing the lawn. In December he said previous attempts to cut costs at the bank had involved taking off the top layer, which grew back when it rained as the number of blades of grass remained the same. What he needed to do, he said, was to make the lawn smaller. Investors are yet to be convinced by his plan for shrinking the bank. The cost of insuring Deutsche against default â€“ by using complex financial instruments called credit default swaps (CDS)â€“ has risen, although the Morgan Stanley analysts suggest this could be for technical reasons. With rumours â€“ denied â€“ that Deutsche might not be able to make payments on specialised bonds known as CoCos that can be converted into shares during times of crisis, investors may have been using the CDS as a form of insurance. Others point to speculators. â€œHedge funds are betting the regulator will make Deutsche pass on paying the coupon on the CoCo, so buy the CDS as a proxy for the subsequent decline in the CoCosâ€™ value â€¦ As the CDS spikes, other investors get nervous about the bankâ€™s health,â€\\x9d said Wheeler. He is confident that Deutsche will emerge from the crisis, which has already prompted German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble to intervene to insist he had â€œno concernsâ€\\x9d about the bank. While SchÃ¤uble will have been pleased to see the lack of panic about Deutscheâ€™s troubles in the German media, he may have been irked by a damning front-page comment in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Headquartered in the same city as the bank, the newspaper said: â€œWhat is one to think of a bank that has to promise its customers and investors that it is able to pay back credits? How solid is a bank that has shed a third of its shareholder value in a month, and half of it over the course of a year? Itâ€™s no longer just the customer of a couple of Greek banks that are asking such tough questions, but the customers of Deutsche Bank.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Lloyds Banking Group reveals surge in buy-to-let lending Lloyds Banking Group, the UKâ€™s biggest mortgage lender, has revealed a surge in activity by buy-to-let and second-home buyers in the run-up to tax changes in April. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio, chief executive of the bailed-out bank, said mortgage activity had been strong in the run-up to the changes, which came into force on 1 April and require buy-to-let and second-home buyers to pay a 3% surcharge on stamp duty. He was speaking as the bank, which owns Halifax, reported its profits had almost halved in the first three months of the year. Last month, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said there had been a 22% year-on-year rise in January in buy-to-let mortgages â€“ although estate agents have warned they expect activity to slow down because of the EU referendum on 23 June. The London-focused chain Foxtons said on Wednesday it expected a â€œreduced sales pipelineâ€\\x9d in the coming three months. Horta-OsÃ³rio said as the Bank of England had not increased interest rates from the record low of 0.5% he had started to pull back slightly from mortgage lending to focus on business lending. The low interest rate environment means he is also accelerating a plan, outlined in late 2014, to close around 200 branches â€“ around 6% of the network â€“ and axe a further 9,000 roles, on top of the 45,000 lost since the rescue of HBOS in 2008. The Lloyds finance director, George Culmer, said the bank was â€œahead of plan on where we expected to beâ€\\x9d. Rather than the 46% fall in first quarter profits to Â£654m, Horta-OsÃ³rio preferred to focus on the Â£2.1bn in underlying profits. â€œThese results demonstrate the strength of our differentiated, simple, low-risk business model and reflect our ability to actively respond to the challenging operating environment,â€\\x9d he said. The UK government has had to postpone a plan to sell most of its remaining 9% stake to retail investors because of the plunge in bank shares since the start of the year. The shares were trading at 67.9p, down 2%, shortly after the Lloyds results were published, below the 73p average price at which the stateâ€™s 43% stake was bought during the 2008 crisis. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, described the performance as â€œa bit flat, as in deflatedâ€\\x9d. The fall in profits was caused by a controversial plan to buy back Â£3bn of debt, which is expected to reduce the bankâ€™s costs annually. The buy-back cost Â£790m in the first quarter, while other items including Â£161m of restructuring charges and Â£115m for possible compensation claims also knocked profits. The bad debt charge was down 6% to Â£149m. However, there was no new provision for payment protection insurance selling, a scandal which has so far cost the banking industry more than Â£30bn, and Â£16bn at Lloyds.',\n",
              "  'Huge rise in hospital beds in England taken up by people with malnutrition The number of hospital beds in England taken up by patients being treated for malnutrition has almost trebled over the last 10 years, in what charities say shows the â€œgenuinely shockingâ€\\x9d extent of hunger and poor diet. Official figures reveal that people with malnutrition accounted for 184,528 hospital bed days last year, a huge rise on 65,048 in 2006-07. The sharp increase is adding to the pressures on hospitals, which are already struggling with record levels of overcrowding. Critics have said the upward trend is a result of rising poverty, deep cutbacks in recent years to meals on wheels services for the elderly and inadequate social care support, especially for older people. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, unearthed the figures in a response to a recent parliamentary question submitted to the health minister Nicola Blackwood. â€œThese figures paint a grim picture of Britain under the Conservatives,â€\\x9d he said. â€œReal poverty is causing vulnerable people, particularly the elderly, to go hungry and undernourished so much so that they end up in hospital. â€œOur research reveals a shocking picture of levels of malnutrition in 21st-century England and the impact it has on our NHS. This is unacceptable in modern Britain.â€\\x9d The Department of Health figures showed that the number of bed days accounted for by someone with a primary or secondary diagnosis of malnutrition rose from 128,361 in 2010-11, the year the coalition came to power, to 184,528 last year â€“ a 44% rise over five years. Such patients only account for one in 256 of all hospital bed days, or 0.4% of the 47.3m total, but the financial cost is considerable as each bed costs the NHS an average of Â£400 a day to staff and given the condition each spell in hospital because lasts an average of 22 to 23 days. Simon Bottery, the director of policy at the charity Independent Age, said: â€œThese new figures on malnutrition are genuinely shocking. As a society there is no excuse for us failing to ensure that older people are able to eat enough food, of the right quality, to stay healthy. â€œYet we have been cutting back the meals on wheels services and lunch clubs on which so many vulnerable elderly people relied and reducing the numbers who receive home care visits.â€\\x9d Freedom of information requests submitted to local councils in England early last year by the then shadow care minister Liz Kendall found that 220,000 fewer people were receiving meals on wheels in late 2014 than in 2010, a fall of 63%. Research by the National Association of Care Catering found that only 48% of local councils still provided meals on wheels, compared to 66% in 2014. Only 17% of councils in the north-west of England still do so, and 91% of providers expect the provision to fall further in the next year. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence classes someone as malnourished if they have a body mass index of less than 18.5, have suffered the unintentional loss of more than 10% of their weight over the last three to six months, or if they have a BMI under 20 and have unintentionally seen their weight drop by more than 5% over the previous three to six months. The decision by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, not to give the NHS or social care any more money in his autumn statement last week would only worsen the situation, Ashworth said. â€œThe reality is the government have failed this week to both give the NHS and social care the extra investment it needs while also failing to invest in prevention initiatives to foster healthier lifestyles. The cuts to public health budgets along with an emaciated obesity strategy are both utterly misguided,â€\\x9d he said. Figures are not available for exactly how many patients accounted for the 184,528 bed days last year, but information supplied to Ashworth by the House of Commons library shows that 57% of the patients were women and that 42% were over-65s. Worryingly, four out of five people who needed inpatient hospital care because of malnutrition were admitted as an emergency, which suggests their health had deteriorated significantly in the days before they were taken in. Not enough health and social care professionals have the time or knowledge to correctly identify malnutrition, Bottery said. Dianne Jeffrey, the chair of the Malnutrition Task Force and Age UK, said: â€œIf malnutrition is left untreated older people can become much more susceptible to illness and injury, are more likely to end up in hospital and on average take much longer to recover if they do become unwell. â€œIt is shocking that in modern times over a million older people across the UK are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition.â€\\x9d A Department of Health spokesperson said: â€œThe NHS is getting much better at spotting malnutrition and giving early treatment, and we are improving our data collection, all of which helps explain what might otherwise appear a significant rise in cases. But importantly, to prevent cases in the future, we have given Â£500,000 to Age UK to help reduce malnutrition among older people and will continue to train staff so early action can be taken.â€\\x9d Stephen Dalton, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said: â€œOur members take malnutrition seriously. Good nutrition is a fundamental human right our citizens can expect, and vulnerable, particularly older, people are most at risk of serious consequences if denied basic compassionate care. At a time of unprecedented demand on health and social care we need to be alert and will take seriously any reliable evidence of basic care not being delivered.â€\\x9d â€¢ This article was amended on 29 November 2016 to correct a percentage increase. The number of bed days accounted for by someone with a primary or secondary diagnosis of malnutrition rose by 44% over five years, not 61%.',\n",
              "  'Do you stand by, or stand out from the crowd? A few months ago I was in a bar with two friends when, a few tables away, we heard a glass smash and looked up to find a man and woman in the middle of an argument. He slapped her and walked out. Everyone froze. She looked horribly alone for a few seconds, hurt and humiliated. Then a customer walked over to see if she was all right, as did a member of staff. They sat with her for some time, while my friends and I wondered awkwardly what we should be doing. It seemed as if she was being offered the support she needed, but was that enough? Should we have offered to act as witnesses if she wanted to take it further? We didnâ€™t â€“ and ended up feeling powerless, even guilty. A decade ago, on the top deck of a night bus wending its way out of central London, I heard a commotion behind me. A man was harassing two women, both clearly uncomfortable and frightened. He sat in the seats behind them, leaning in and talking while they asked him to leave them alone in broken English â€“ they were tourists. Feeling brave, I went over and sat down near them, hoping that would inhibit him. He wasnâ€™t happy and turned his fire on me. Although he got off after a stop or two, he promised to â€œcut [my] fucking head offâ€\\x9d as he went down the stairs. After it was all over, the two women thanked me and I got a pat on the back from another passenger after theyâ€™d left too. It seemed as if Iâ€™d done the right thing and I felt pleased with myself. Another time, I was on a very crowded tube train. Someone pulled the emergency cord and a woman, hyperventilating, stumbled out on to the platform. She was terrified, crying out between breaths, and was led to a bench by the baffled-looking commuter who happened to have been standing next to her. He sat with her, shrugging his shoulders slightly as hundreds of us stared, standing like penguins in front of the open doors, waiting for the train to get on its way. It occurred to me that she needed to be told to breathe more slowly. She was experiencing a panic attack and could have done with reassurance and someone to help her pace herself. There was no reason I couldnâ€™t have done it â€“ I wasnâ€™t in a hurry. But instead I stayed put. I felt embarrassed right then and selfish afterwards. Those are the times Iâ€™ve been a bystander, and itâ€™s a mixed record. Itâ€™s an intensely awkward role to play, and itâ€™s not always clear in the moment what the right thing to do is. Intervening can feel like an act of bravado, or attention-seeking â€“ maybe thatâ€™s what motivated me on that night bus. But primed by all those videos of racist abuse, and stories of the pain that the silence of onlookers can cause, shouldnâ€™t we always be prepared to speak up for someone who is being attacked? Each of the incidents Iâ€™ve described happened in the â€œrealâ€\\x9d world. There was the opportunity for face-to-face interaction. But Iâ€™ve been a bystander far more often, I suppose â€“ we all have â€“ in another arena: online. And a new paper in the journal Computers and Human Behaviour raises some interesting questions about when and why we intervene. Researchers at UCLA set up a fake Facebook profile in which a â€œmeanâ€\\x9d comment was posted under a range of different status updates, such as â€œI hate it when you miss someone like crazy and you think they might not miss you backâ€\\x9d. In each case, the â€œmeanâ€\\x9d riposte was: â€œWho cares! This is why nobody likes you â€¦â€\\x9d Most subjects agreed that this constituted bullying, and many said that they would be likely to intervene â€“ either by challenging the comment or sending a private message of support. Interestingly, there was less sympathy when the original message was more personal, suggesting that people who â€œoversharedâ€\\x9d might be seen as bringing criticism on themselves. More important, perhaps, is the finding, uncovered in earlier studies, that people are less likely to intervene online than they are in the real world. This could be due to the bystander effect â€“ psychologists have known for a long time that the more witnesses there are to an emergency, the less likely any given individual is to take action. Itâ€™s a kind of apathy related to the sense that someone else will probably deal with it, so we donâ€™t have to. But it could also be due to the terrifying nature of online bullying, which can very easily expand to involve hundreds, if not thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. Who wants to mess with that volume of fury? But the literature also shows that, whether online or off, â€œvictims experience heightened distress when bystanders do not interveneâ€\\x9d. Whatâ€™s more, it has been shown that â€œreceiving support from onlookers can significantly alleviate victimsâ€™ plightâ€\\x9d. One a recent flight from Paris to Sydney, the writer Catharine Lumby found herself sitting next to a volatile, aggressive man Part-way through the flight, he suddenly shouted, â€œI will kill you! I will kill you!â€\\x9d Lumby writes: â€œIâ€™m a woman in my 50s who has travelled a lot and I have a very thick skin. But the man next to me put me in fear of my life. The flight attendants on Air France, however, refused to move me. The other passengers looked the other way. I spent the next eight hours scared and very upset. On reflection, what really upset me was that no one offered to help.â€\\x9d Echoing Lumbyâ€™s experience, a report into anti-Muslim abuse towards the end of last year found repeated examples of people standing by while bullying occurred. â€œWhen I suffer abuse in public, people walk off or stare,â€\\x9d said one respondent. Another recalled, â€œWhen I was walking to the shops a man behind me pulled my hijab and strangled me but no one stood up for me, and he said to me, â€˜Are you going to bomb Boots?â€™â€\\x9d In contrast, Ruhi Rahman drew strength from the reaction of her fellow passengers after a â€œracist and threateningâ€\\x9d man approached her and her sister on the train. â€œBefore I even got a chance to react to his comments the women beside me supported me and helped. After a while most of the people on the metro came over and spoke up for us and were being so supportive.â€\\x9d Rahman told the Newcastle Chronicle the experience made her feel â€œreally optimistic and hopeful â€¦ I have never felt more proud of being a Geordie. It was lovely that everyone came together to help us and I canâ€™t thank them all enough.â€\\x9d Iâ€™m not saying we should all become have-a-go heroes. Stepping in can be dangerous. But intervention doesnâ€™t have to mean tackling an aggressor. It can involve reaching out a hand of support in the moments afterwards, offering practical help, or sending a message once things have died down. Increasingly we find ourselves in crowds â€“ making our way through cities, flying between them, joining in discussion and argument on the internet. Ironically, these crowds, each one a mass of humanity, can feel like the least human force on Earth. Perhaps from time to time we can try to be among the faces that stand out.',\n",
              "  'Victor Moses goal seals Chelsea comeback as Tottenham lose unbeaten record The team who are already developing an air of Antonio Conteâ€™s Undroppables cruise on. After fielding the same Premier League selection for the sixth successive â€“ and successful â€“ time, Chelsea continued their revival as they saw off Tottenham, showing the mettle to muster a comeback after going a goal behind in the first half. Two of the players who have thrived most from the Conte redesign, Pedro and Victor Moses, supplied the goals to settle a riveting local tussle. After Manchester City and Liverpool had plundered points earlier in the day, nothing less than three would suffice to return to the top of the table. Chelsea reacted ruthlessly. It left Conte with the air of a contented manager. He acknowledged the evolution that makes his team a different proposition in the high-intensity games to the side who capitulated against Liverpool and Arsenal. â€œNow we are another team compared to the Liverpool and Arsenal games,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIf we were the same team we would lose this game, for sure. Now we have another type of confidence. I liked our reaction a lot. We won and I am pleased because it wasnâ€™t easy.â€\\x9d For Tottenham, defeat here to a long-term bogey side is nothing new but what must hurt is that for a spell their performance showed them at their best, with a refreshed appetite for the style that had them unbeaten in the Premier League until the winter chill had set in. History suggested that Stamford Bridge might be a test too far and what felt like a week of reckoning duly delivered two heavyweight blows. After tumbling out of the Champions League in midweek, Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s men were punctured in the league. The Tottenham manager managed to be frustrated and philosophical at the same time: â€œIf you want to analyse the result, Chelsea win, congratulations. If you want to analyse the 94 minutes, Tottenham had a lot of positives. But in football you need to score. In football sometimes itâ€™s difficult to explain but this is not difficult. They were clinical in front of the goal and we werenâ€™t.â€\\x9d After the smouldering volcano of this fixture last season, he had called upon his team to be â€œbraveâ€\\x9d and his players began as if that instruction was still ringing in their ears. Keeping a semblance of self-control was imperative and they started by exerting important authority in midfield, pegging Chelsea back and keeping confident possession. Ten minutes in they soared in front. Mousa DembÃ©lÃ© worked the ball up the left and it was moved via Dele Alli to Christian Eriksen. The Dane saw a chink of goal to aim at. His thunderous shot was laced with curl and flew into the net. It was the first time Chelseaâ€™s defence had been beaten in 600 minutes. Conte looked exasperated as his team could not get a foothold. The muscle in Tottenhamâ€™s midriff, with DembÃ©lÃ© and Victor Wanyama patrolling in front of Eric Dier and Jan Vertonghen, proved a meaty barrier. David Luiz mustered Chelseaâ€™s first shot just before the half-hour mark, a whack of a free-kick that Hugo Lloris caught comfortably. Tottenhamâ€™s dominance was such that they continued to create strong chances. After efforts from Kyle Walker, Harry Kane and Eriksen the visitors wondered how they were not even further in front as half-time approached. What more devastating time for Chelsea to summon some inspiration. A minute before half-time all Tottenhamâ€™s hard work was speared by a moment of glorious individual skill. Pedro picked up possession 20 yards out and wrong-footed the Tottenham defence with a touch that had a dash of Cruyff turn about it. The Spaniard bent his shot into the top corner with a flourish. Off the hook after a pretty uncomfortable first 44 minutes, Conte delivered some choice words at half-time. Chelsea came out with enhanced determination and were soon ahead. They pressed the ball off Tottenham and broke with intent. Eden Hazard invited Diego Costa to drive forwards and he capped a bullish and clever run with a killer pass to Moses, whose shot squirted off Lloris and Vertonghen on the way in. The pendulum had swung. Chelseaâ€™s energy levels suddenly made Tottenham look ponderous. It spoke volumes about how the balance of the game shifted that both Chelseaâ€™s wing-backs had so much more room to get involved. Although Tottenham tried to manufacture a comeback of their own, Chelseaâ€™s second-half solidity was a far tougher nut to crack. Conteâ€™s Undroppables cherished their win. Tottenhamâ€™s pain was palpable. Conte tried hard to deflect any title talk at this stage. â€œIt is not right to talk about this,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe have a long way in front of us. Itâ€™s important to stay humble and continue to trust in our work. Today we won a game against a really strong team. Tomorrow itâ€™s important to think about the next game, against City, another very strong team. We have to continue to work. We donâ€™t forget that against Arsenal and Liverpool we lost.â€\\x9d In attitude and application, Conteâ€™s Chelsea are a force to be reckoned with.',\n",
              "  \"Wonga's losses expected to double to Â£70m for 2015 Wongaâ€™s losses are expected to almost double after a slump in revenues at the payday lender following price caps imposed by the City regulator. The results, due to be announced on Wednesday, appear to raise questions about the success of the companyâ€™s attempts to reinvent itself in the tougher regulatory environment, as it tries to shrug off past controversies over its business practices. Last year Wonga was ordered to pay more than Â£2.6m compensation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for â€œunfair and misleading debt collection practicesâ€\\x9d, after it was found to have sent threatening letters to customers from non-existent law firms. In 2012 the Office of Fair Trading told it to clean up its act after it sent letters to customers accusing them of fraud. On Tuesday Sky News reported that Wonga would post a pre-tax loss of about Â£70m in 2015, compared with Â£37m a year earlier. The results will also show a sharp decline in Wongaâ€™s revenues from Â£215m in 2014, the channel said. The company declined to comment. The numbers come after a year in which Wonga and other payday lenders have been forced to operate under tighter regulations. Last year interest and fees on all high-cost short-term credit loans were capped at a daily rate of 0.8% of the amount borrowed. Meanwhile, if borrowers do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed Â£15, while the total cost including fees and interest is capped at 100% of the original sum. According to the FCA, which introduced the rules, this means no borrower will pay back more than twice the amount they borrowed. The move followed a string of criticisms levelled at the sector amid allegations of unscrupulous practices and customers running up huge debts. Wonga â€“which recruited Andy Haste, a former boss of RSA insurance group, to clean up its image in 2014 â€“ has said it wants to move its business away from the short-term lending that made its name, but also made it the focus of public anger. â€œWonga has understandably faced criticism and we know we need to repair our reputation and regain our right to be an accepted part of the financial service sector,â€\\x9d Haste said when he took on the Â£500,000-a-year job. However, the scale of the turnaround facing Haste is illustrated by the latest figures, which take Wongaâ€™s losses for the past two financial years to more than Â£100m. In the two years before that, the company made a profit of Â£39.7m in 2013 and Â£84.5m in 2012.\",\n",
              "  \"Disco's Saturday Night Fiction Picture it: a writer pens a magazine article and itâ€™s an instant sensation. Producers come calling, he sells the rights for tens of thousands, the tabloids give him a nickname, acquaintances greet him as a friend, cheques flood in, he attends the premiere of his film in Los Angeles with a famous disco singer on his arm. Itâ€™s glitzy, itâ€™s glam, itâ€™s Hollywood, baby. But as he makes his way through the frenzy outside the theatre, through security, paparazzi and screaming teenage girls, he is filled with moral panic. Why? Saturday Night Fever was released in 1977, and has since grossed $285m worldwide. The soundtrack became one of the bestselling film album of all time after staying at No 1 for 24 consecutive weeks, reinvigorating the Bee Geesâ€™ career, and its star, John Travolta, became one of the youngest actors to be nominated for the best actor Oscar. Decades on, not many remember that the phenomenon was down to one man: Northern Irish rock critic Nik Cohn and his report of 7 June, 1976 for New York magazine, Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Nights, which was published 40 years ago this month. Cohn was the author of a number of books including the 1969 rock history Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom. A protege of swinging London, he partied with rock stars, joined the Who on tour, and is said by some to have been instrumental in the genesis of Bowieâ€™s Ziggy Stardust. He had his portrait shot by Iain Macmillan â€“ the photographer behind the Beatlesâ€™ Abbey Road cover â€“ and from the age of 18 was contributing briefings about mods and rockers to the . After crossing the Atlantic and signing on with New York magazine in 1975, the writer, who came to feel disenchanted with the establishment music business, persuaded the magâ€™s founder and editor Clay Felker to let him document disco â€“ a new, largely ethnic, largely gay underground trend that had taken over parts of New York City. The result was the profile of an â€œultimate Faceâ€\\x9d. Vincent, a young Italian-American worked in a hardware store during the week and partied at a disco club called 2001 Odyssey on the weekend. Vincent â€œwas the very best dancer in Bay Ridge â€¦ he owned 14 floral shirts, five suits, eight pairs of shoes, three overcoats, and had appeared on American Bandstandâ€\\x9d. He and his friends knew nothing of flower power, Bob Dylan or Ken Kesey. They were opulent but poor, proud but shy. â€œThe new generation takes few risks,â€\\x9d Cohn wrote. â€œIt goes through high school, obedient; graduates, looks for a job, saves and plans. Endures. And once a week, on Saturday night, its one great moment of release, it explodes.â€\\x9d The intro declared: â€œEverything described in this article is factual and was either witnessed by me or told to me directly by the people involved. Only the names of the main characters have been changed.â€\\x9d The rest is cinema history: film rights were sold to producer Robert Stigwood, who had just signed a three-picture deal with a young TV actor called John Travolta. Screenwriter Norman Wexler transformed Vincent into Tony Manero. So unprecedented was the fanfare that when Stigwoodâ€™s 23-year-old assistant Kevin McCormick traipsed through Los Angeles looking for a director, one agent, according to Vanity Fair, told him, â€œKid, my directors do movies. They donâ€™t do magazine articles.â€\\x9d Director John Badham had no such qualms, and in December 1977 his movie took $11m in its first 11 days and Travolta became an overnight sensation. Twenty years later came a bombshell. In December 1997 New York magazine published an article in which Cohn confessed that there never was a Vincent. There was no â€œLisaâ€\\x9d, â€œBillyâ€\\x9d, â€œJohn Jamesâ€\\x9d, â€œLorraineâ€\\x9d or â€œDonnaâ€\\x9d either. While 2001 Odyssey existed, it wasnâ€™t the way the writer described it in 1976. The whole scene of disco-loving Italians, as mythologised in Saturday Night Fever, was exaggerated. The most bizarre detail was that his disco protagonists were in fact based on mods Cohn had known in London. The writer was â€œpainfully awareâ€\\x9d that everything Fever had brought him â€“ the fame, the fortune â€“ was the result of a lie. The real story went like this: in 1976 Cohn met a disco dancer named Tu Sweet, who introduced him to the clubs of New York, including one in Bay Ridge called 2001 Odyssey. One night the two trawled through the underbelly of New York â€“ a land of auto shops, transmission specialists and alignment centres â€“ to find the place. A drunken brawl was in progress and as Cohn opened the cab door one of the guys reeled over the gutter and threw up over his trouser leg. So he just upped and returned to the safe comforts of Manhattan. One image stayed with the writer, though, that of a figure in flared crimson pants and a black body shirt standing in the doorway of the club and calmly watching the action. There was a style about him, Cohn said, a sense of his own specialness that reminded the writer of a teen gang in his hometown of Derry and a mod named Chris heâ€™d met in London in 1965. When Cohn went back to Odyssey he didnâ€™t see the young man in the doorway again. â€œPlus, I made a lousy interviewer,â€\\x9d he wrote. â€œI knew nothing about this world, and it showed. Quite literally, I didnâ€™t speak the language. So I faked it. I conjured up the story of the figure in the doorway, and named him Vincent. Taking all I knew about the snake-charmer in Derry and, more especially, about Chris the mod in London, I translated them as best I could to Brooklyn. Then I went back to Bay Ridge in daylight and noted the major landmarks. I walked some streets, went into a couple of stores. Studied the clothes, the gestures, the walks. Imagined how it would feel to burn up, all caged energies, with no outlet but the dancefloor and the rituals of Saturday night. Finally, I wrote it all up. And presented it as fact.â€\\x9d So how did he get away with one of the most daring acts of journalistic forgery? While Tribal Rites reads like a novelisation, it must be understood in the context of the time it was written: the tail-end of the era of New Journalism, where writers used literary techniques and a subjective perspective to present fact as fiction. It followed similar works by the likes of Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Hunter S Thompson and Norman Mailer. When I first approached Cohn for this article, he said he no longer wanted to discuss the topic. But after several back-and-forth emails, he did say that he doubted any magazine would publish the Tribal Rites piece today. â€œIt reads to me as obvious fiction, albeit based on observation and some knowledge of disco culture. No way could it sneak past customs now. In the 60s and 70s, the line between fact and fiction was blurry. Many magazine writers used fictional techniques to tell supposedly factual stories. No end of liberties were taken. Few editors asked tough questions. For the most part it was a case of â€˜donâ€™t ask, donâ€™t tellâ€™. â€œMagazine writing then was basically a boysâ€™ club. There was a lot of wretched excess. Along with some great writing came reams of self-indulgent bollocks. Tribal Rites being fiction was never a great secret. I remember once, at the end of a long night, blurting out to a publisher that the story was made up. â€˜You donâ€™t say,â€™ the publisher drawled. â€˜And Liberace is gay.â€™â€\\x9d For context, Gay Talese, now a bestselling author and one of the pioneers of new journalism and author of â€˜Frank Sinatra Has a Coldâ€™, explains that his intention as a young journalist was to write short stories using real characters. â€œI have always been inspired by great short story writers, the first being the French writer Guy de Maupassant,â€\\x9d he said. â€œLater I also began reading short stories by famous novelists â€“ F Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and more contemporary writers such as John Oâ€™Hara, Irwin Shaw, Carson McCullers, John Cheever and others. My newspaper articles were all written as if short stories: there was scene-setting, dialogue, much description of people and places.â€\\x9d But while the articles were presented as stories, they were never fictionalised. â€œNothing was invented, all the names of the characters were real, and verifiably truthful.â€\\x9d Caroline Miller, who edited New York magazine at the time of Cohnâ€™s confession, said her predecessor, Felker, wouldnâ€™t have published Tribal Rites if he thought it fabricated. â€œThat said, remember that 70s Brooklyn was a foreign country to most New York magazine editors,â€\\x9d she told me. â€œIt wasnâ€™t cool, and some of them had probably never been there â€“ even to Brooklyn Heights, which was Norman Mailer territory. So they may not have had good radar for credibility. Also, after the zeitgeisty opening about the blue-collar disco tribe, [Tribal Rites] is all narrative, and that much narrative detail tends to read as real. Conversation in cars. What Vincent was thinking as he looked in the mirrorâ€¦â€\\x9d Miller and her team published Cohnâ€™s admission because it was newsworthy. â€œHereâ€™s a guy basically bragging about fabricating a legendary story and getting away with it,â€\\x9d she said. â€œAnd it certainly added to our understanding of pop culture myth-making â€“ the idea that a mashup of people and scenes Nik had collected on both side of the Atlantic could go essentially unchallenged, and have such staying power.â€\\x9d Cohn has said that were it not for Jim McMullanâ€™s accompanying illustrations the piece might never have seen daylight. McMullan based these on the photographs he took in 2001 Odyssey but, fundamentally, he never met Cohnâ€™s protagonist. â€œI went to the club twice and moved around, taking my photos without interacting much with any of the patrons,â€\\x9d McMullan recalled. â€œNik took a different path through the crowds so we didnâ€™t exchange notes. â€œI finished my paintings several weeks before Nik finished his story so I wasnâ€™t really reacting to how he saw the scene at the club. It did seem like an amazingly dramatic story arc and the kind of â€˜working-classâ€™ story he was already famous for.â€\\x9d It so happened that the design director of New York magazine, Milton Glaser, was amazed by the reportage style of the paintings. â€œClay also came to see the work that way... I suspect that because the art was all ready to go before Nik finished writing, it put some pressure on him to get it written. Had the paintings not already impressed Milton and Clay, I suppose it might have been easier to scuttle the whole project.â€\\x9d Did McMullanâ€™s art indicate a truth to the piece? While Cohnâ€™s descriptions of the clubâ€™s â€œFacesâ€\\x9d were based on the working class in England, they werenâ€™t entirely off the mark. â€œJust like the Italian-Americans, the mods shopped for that perfect shirt,â€\\x9d Colleen â€œCosmoâ€\\x9d Murphy, an American radio broadcaster, DJ, producer and founder of Classic Album Sundays, explained to me over coffee in London one morning. â€œIt was about looking like they were better off than they really were, sticking their money into things like music and clothes. They bought records, certain types of trousers, certain types of jackets. It was an attitude. â€œItâ€™s that culture of people who have their regular job during the week and live to go out on the weekend. A blue-collar worker in Brooklyn isnâ€™t going to be defined by their job. Who they really are is who they are when they go out. Just like a mod. A mod might be bricklayer, but theyâ€™re a mod.â€\\x9d Bill Brewster, former editor of Mixmag USA and founder of Djhistory.com, echoed this: â€œItâ€™s a universal story that had been going on for decades even before there were DJs playing records,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWorking-class kids going out on a Friday and Saturday and getting off their heads to American black music. It was happening in the cellars of Paris during the occupation in terms of jazz records. Those archetypes, even though Cohn based them on people in London, were obviously happening in New York as well. I think it was an educated guess on his part, and a correct one.â€\\x9d Disco as a genre and culture had already been gathering pace in New York so Saturday Night Fever was just the tipping point of something that had been going on for a while. â€œEven before disco was officially called disco, you had David Mancusoâ€™s loft parties, in the late 60s, in downtown Manhattan, where he played danceable acid-rock, R&B, mixing it all up,â€\\x9d said Murphy, who has collaborated with Mancuso in the past. â€œThey were all about integrating different kinds of people, whether it was class, race, sexual orientation. People like David Morales and Larry Levan were going as kids. At the same time Francis Grasso became the first DJ to start mixing records together with two turntables. In the mid-70s these other clubs started rising â€“ Studio 54, which was the glitzy manhattan club, where Andy Warhol, Grace Jones and Liza Minelli hung out, and places like 2001 Odyssey, which were for the working-class Brooklynites.â€\\x9d But in the end it was Cohnâ€™s article and Saturday Night Fever that gave the decade its cultural identity. â€œAs a child I was living in Massachusetts, in a white suburban New England small town, listening to rock and pop ,â€\\x9d Murphy said. â€œThen this article happened, the movie came out and disco blew up across white America overnight. Me and my friends would dance to the soundtrack at slumber parties. I had aunts and uncles who were taking disco-dancing lessons.â€\\x9d Then came the backlash. DJ Steve Dahl headed up a Disco Demolition Night in Chicago in July 1979. People wore â€œdisco sucksâ€\\x9d T-shirts. The Bee Gees became cheesy, Chic became cheesy, and by the 80s disco was a dirty word. â€œSaturday Night Fever was probably the thing that killed off disco in the end,â€\\x9d Murphy said. Cohn, now 70, lives in Ghent, New York. His life reads like a blockbuster of its own â€“ after Tribal Rites he continued writing, true stories mostly, and in 1983 was arrested for conspiring to import millions of dollars worth of heroin and cocaine into the US. The more serious charges were dropped and Cohn was given five yearsâ€™ probation for possession. His life, the writer then realised, had been unravelling and it was time for a change. â€œWhy did I decide to come clean in 1997? It simply felt like time,â€\\x9d he told me. â€œWhat seemed OK to me when I was young and stoned no longer sat right. Accountability, letâ€™s say.â€\\x9d Cohn has always maintained that what was genuine was the staying power of Saturday Night Fever itself. That central figure, with all his grace, energy and passion. A nobody who once a week was a somebody. â€œTribal Rites is about identity,â€\\x9d he said. â€œFinding a place in the world where you can shine. What still resonates, to me at least, is the sense of yearning. If I was writing the story today, Vincent might be transâ€¦â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Wilderness â€“ the festival that mixes music and Momentum Naked cricket. A Chicago house legend. The uplifting sound of a 30-piece orchestra. Wilderness certainly has a varied palate, yet caters to a rather one-note clientele. Now in its sixth year and hosted on the 5,000-acre Cornbury Park estate in the heart of Oxfordshire, the festival is the kind of place David Cameron might leave his kid behind at. Or, to put it another way: I spent Saturday at a Raymond Blanc lunch sat between an accountant and a former Whitehall staffer. One half of the Brexit divide writ Magnum-size. With a weaker lineup than in previous years, Wilderness still delivers some strong musical moments on what is a gloriously sunny weekend. Robert Plant, the Corbyn-aged (67) former Led Zeppelin frontman, electrifies the Friday night headline slot with Whole Lotta Love during his only UK 2016 gig. Lianne La Havas, returning after her memorable 2012 appearance here, exudes genuine joy on the main stage, switching deftly between numerous Gibson Les Pauls and telling us her mum just called to say her musicâ€™s being used on the BBC Olympics coverage. A cover of Aretha Franklinâ€™s Say a Little Prayer is a treat, and the singerâ€™s dress is so much admired that someone in the front row has the good sense to ask where itâ€™s from (Temperley). Elsewhere, stumbling upon Diana Yukawaâ€™s haunting violin while scoffing an Â£8 falafel scotch egg is a revelation as the sun sets on the Atrium stage. James Rhodes proves, via Rachmaninov, why he has 50,000 Twitter followers. And local boys Glass Animals impress with their intelligent fusion of R&B, zig-zag bass-lines and Tetris beats. Shuraâ€™s set is assured and Touch gets the twentysomethings up from east London throwing angular shapes. Over in the Valley, a deep cleavage of greenery and ancient trees, Derrick Carterâ€™s perfectly judged 2am house is elegantly lit by Tracey Emin-inspired neons. But Sunday headliners the Flaming Lips disappoint with a weak vocal and the bizarre choice to have frontman Wayne Coyne barely visible behind a curtain of lights Away from the music, there is spoon carving, wild swimming and a cabaret show featuring a PVC-clad Kitty Bang Bang. Oh, and a man riding a bicycle along a tightrope through flames, because why the hell not? The star of one of numerous insightful debates is Larry Sanders, forever to be introduced as brother of Bernie, but delivering salient points as Green Party health spokesperson in his own right. In the same debate, George Galloway â€œwill not apologiseâ€\\x9d for being a straight white man and rails against â€œrightwing Ed Milibandâ€\\x9d. Heâ€™s dressed all in black despite the 26 degree heat and is wearing a fedora indoors. Momentumâ€™s James Schneider speaks of a burgeoning Labour membership and thereâ€™s a ripple of applause like a second round Wimbledon win on court 2 from an audience who have just paid Â£20 for glitter accessories. Wildernessâ€™s general vibe appears to be a mashup of Latitude and Hay, with the dress-up chops of Secret Garden. And Sunday nightâ€™s Bowie tribute â€“ featuring the Wilderness orchestra and choir; London Contemporary Voices; Kate Nash and Charlotte Church â€“ is a properly stirring experience. Ending with Memory of a Free Festival might be somewhat awkward for obvious reasons, but it does allow for a rousing finale singalong. The audience filters away to a Bowie voiceover: â€œsee you all once again, another day, in another placeâ€\\x9d. Wilderness might not be where the wild things are, but itâ€™s jolly good fun nonetheless, old sport.',\n",
              "  'West Ham stun 10-man Everton as Dimitri Payet seals fightback win Season tickets at Goodison Park come with a guarantee of entertainment and the promise of frustration. Those at the Olympic Stadium may come with the carrot of Champions League football. Everton announced on Friday that they are reducing prices for next season. West Ham United are raising expectations for it. An extraordinary comeback, featuring three goals in 12 minutes, turned defeat into victory and maintained their hopes of a top-four finish. Credibility was stretched as the points were pilfered. â€œUnbelievable,â€\\x9d said Slaven Bilic. â€œNobody can deny we deserved it. We showed our quality, we showed our stubbornness and we got a great win.â€\\x9d They are a team transformed. They used to approach trips to Merseyside with trepidation, but won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years in August. A 16-game winless run against Everton in the top flight came to an abrupt end, courtesy of Michail Antonio, Diafra Sakho and Dimitri Payet. West Hamâ€™s signing of the season provided the dramatic denouement. Andy Carroll headed Aaron Cresswellâ€™s diagonal ball down, Sakho improvised a backheel flick and Payet nipped in to score the winner. A catalytic signing contributed a crucial goal to determine a cracking game. Yet another Hammer exerted an equal influence and made the fightback feasible. West Ham were two goals adrift and being run ragged by Romelu Lukaku when twin pieces of acrobatics by AdriÃ¡n proved to be turning points. The Spaniard saved twice from Evertonâ€™s top scorer, once from a strangely hesitant penalty and once when he burst clear on goal. He had already made stunning stops to deny James McCarthy and Ross Barkley, who each eyed spectacular long-range strikes, in a one-man rearguard action. It brought a belated reward when his attacking colleagues conjured three goals. â€œIf they had scored that penalty they would have won the game maybe 3-0 or 4-0,â€\\x9d Bilic admitted. Everton could rue AdriÃ¡nâ€™s excellence and Lukakuâ€™s misses. Yet, profligate as he was, he has also proved prolific. In any case, there were other reasons for Evertonâ€™s seventh home league defeat of the season. They display a costly carelessness, and have squandered a two-goal advantage four times already. A poor, porous defence has been a regular source of complaint and Ramiro Funes Mori stood flat-footed for two of the West Ham goals. Roberto MartÃ\\xadnezâ€™s initial gambit of matching Bilicâ€™s 3-4-3 formation had paid off and his half-time introduction of Muhamed Besic brought a benefit when the Bosnian won the penalty that Lukaku spurned. Yet the removal of two in-form goalscorers who were tormenting West Ham â€“ first Aaron Lennon and then Lukaku â€“ afforded the visitors the initiative. And the culpable Belgian really was Kevin Mirallas, not Lukaku. The winger had been booked for diving before he upended Cresswell. His arm was immediately raised in apology but it was not enough to spare him a second yellow card, or Everton an hour with 10 men. The Goodison faithful afforded the departing winger a generous ovation and blamed the referee, Anthony Taylor. So did MartÃ\\xadnez, who identified a scapegoat for a setback. â€œThe second booking is a decision the referee has to make,â€\\x9d he admitted. â€œThe first one is a ridiculous decision. Why should we book a player because we feel it is not a free-kick? I donâ€™t feel he is a referee who understands the game in a way that we want it played.â€\\x9d Evertonâ€™s understanding was apparent in a slickly worked opener, Bryan Oviedo finding Lukaku, who accelerated away to score in an eighth successive game against West Ham. â€œThe performance for spells was outstanding,â€\\x9d said MartÃ\\xadnez. So was Lukakuâ€™s. Bilic admitted: â€œWhen they had the ball, he makes that one-player loss less visible. He creates mayhem.â€\\x9d He also fashioned Lennonâ€™s fifth goal in seven games, the winger accepting Lukakuâ€™s return pass to score. Then AdriÃ¡n intervened. â€œThe penalty was a big blow psychologically,â€\\x9d said MartÃ\\xadnez. â€œRomelu Lukaku is such a reliable footballer that we were all a little bit shocked.â€\\x9d West Ham were galvanised. Bilic had gambled, bringing on Carroll and Sakho. Substitutes starred after a starter scored. Antonioâ€™s third goal in three games was headed in from Mark Nobleâ€™s cross. Another delivery from the visitorsâ€™ left flank yielded an equaliser. Payet was the supplier, Sakho heading in. Payetâ€™s winner left even Bilic bemused. â€œI didnâ€™t know what to do, so I ran down the tunnel and I came back straightaway,â€\\x9d he said, though a celebration was the product of a half-time conversation. â€œI said that â€˜we are one down but we are going to do itâ€™,â€\\x9d he revealed. â€œWe had to be less sexy and more lethal.â€\\x9d Everton could do with displaying a similar hard-nosed pragmatism. â€œI thought our performance, defensively, was outstanding for 78 minutes and very poor from then on,â€\\x9d said MartÃ\\xadnez. But whether discounting tickets or gifting goals, their generosity knows no bounds.',\n",
              "  'Tottenham win title for youthful promise and being the most watchable If youâ€™ve somehow managed to miss the opening eight months of the Premier League season you could have picked up a pretty decent precis of the action so far just by watching Sundayâ€™s games at the Stadium of Light and White Hart Lane. Basically itâ€™s been like that all along. Leicester City have scored lots of breakaway goals and played like a proper team. Itâ€™s been emotional. People have cried. The usual heavyweights have ranged from poor to bafflingly dreadful. And beyond that Tottenham Hotspur have been the most watchable, most promising, most intriguing team in the league this season. All issues of sentiment, underdoggery and fairytale glee aside, it is an achievement that deserves at least a slice of the adulation being lavished on the champions-elect. This is not to suggest Leicester are unworthy league winners. The table is never wrong. Leicester have been the most consistent team by some way, seven points clear and not so much sprinting for the line as already off on one of those helmet-doffing, high-fiving home-run trundles around the baseball diamond, waving to the crowd, taking the cheers, ball safely spiralling off above the bleachers into the blue. Even in the second half of the season Leicester have dropped fewer points than their nearest challengers. They beat Spurs 1-0 at White Hart Lane in January, and deservedly so. For Claudio Ranieriâ€™s team this has been both a wonderful story and a purely sporting triumph of teamwork, talent and unblinking focus. Still, one achievement should not diminish another and Spurs have been by so many other measures the most compelling team in the Premier League, the most layered, all the while remaining the only Premier League team (fairytale Foxes included) to run a profit on transfer spending over the past five years. Against Manchester United on Sunday they started poorly. Dele Alli made a lovely run for his goal but otherwise he was largely absent. Harry Kane ragged Chris Smalling about once or twice but touched the ball only 33 times, a rare lack of involvement for an unusually assertive No9. The full-backs were muted, Kyle Walker bothered at times by the high-class menace of Anthony Martial. And yet even on an off-day Tottenham were hugely enthralling in the periods when the pistons began to fire. By the time the goal rush arrived in the final 20 minutes Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s team had begun to swarm in that familiar way, every passing angle, every pocket of space choked off. This isnâ€™t so much the old push-and-run Spurs as push-and-run-and-snipe-and-hustle, albeit in a controlled kind of way. The idea Tottenham will inevitably tire themselves out before the seasonâ€™s end has always been based on a slight misunderstanding. This isnâ€™t simply covering every blade of grass, Carlton Palmer-style. There is no blur of perpetual motion here. Spursâ€™ defensive movements are instead minutely drilled, with every shift of position among the opposition a cue for some interlocking reshuffle of the pieces, energy not so much wasted as put to synchronised good use. Often Eric Dier and Mousa DembÃ©lÃ© will stand still, waiting for the play to arrange itself around them. There are some interesting similarities between the leagueâ€™s top two. Both have a simple set of methods based around teamwork and quick, accurate passing. Both are genuine collectives, the role of each player equally weighted, without favourites or luxuries or glitzy passengers. But Spurs simply have more depth to their game. They are a team who can score all kinds of goals, can play with the ball or on the break, for whom eight players have scored three or more goals in the league this season. Spurs have scored more goals than anyone else while conceding fewer. Their starting outfield players were, on average, almost four years younger than Leicesterâ€™s equivalent on Sunday. Ranieriâ€™s men will be hugely impressive champions but there is another gear to come in this Tottenham team. Or at least, there should be. If there is reason to celebrate Spurs excellence, even as the season dwindles into a race for second place, it is the simple fact that such progress is precarious. Last weekend Sir Alex Ferguson gave an interview to Sky Sports, apparently at his own behest, in which he lavished praise on Pochettinoâ€™s work. It is hard to see any obvious reason, beyond the really obvious, why Ferguson would choose to do this. Pochettino is an ambitious manager. He will be hugely in demand now, as will Tottenhamâ€™s best players. There is a shelf life to any rising team these days. Money will not allow this to go on unchecked for ever. Not that there is reason to think anyoneâ€™s leaving just yet. This Spurs team can look forward to another title challenge next season, with plenty of flux among the usual heavyweights and the new champions facing a different set of challenges, not least the demands of running a midweek team as well. Spurs dropped seven points this season after Europa League fixtures, the exact extent of Leicesterâ€™s lead at the top. By the end against United, Tottenham were lolling about at White Hart Lane like drunken lords, no doubt thrilled by the sense of their own power in that three-goal burst but still aware that for this season the race may be done. For the most captivating of second-placers the challenge now is simply to make their excellence count in more tangible ways.',\n",

BBC Worldwide said the 90-minute Victorian-themed show, which debuted on the PBS TV network in the US, was screened in 750 cinemas nationwide on 5 and 6 January and grossed $2.7m. On a per-screen gross ticket sales average, Sherlock topped the US box office over its two-day run, beating hits including Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it added. â€œThe intention was always to give Sherlock: The Abominable Bride a limited release to amplify the TV moment and create a piece of event cinema for fans to enjoy,â€\\x9d said Sally de St Croix, head of drama brands at BBC Worldwide. â€œWe never expected it to outshine major Hollywood franchises at the box office and couldnâ€™t be more thrilled with the results.â€\\x9d Sherlock has become a global phenomenon, but nowhere more so than in China where it topped the box office on its first weekend, prompting the BBC to extend its cinema run with sales currently at $20m. In South Korea, where the film hit the number two spot, The Abominable Bride has so far grossed more than $7m. In Australia it racked up more than Aus$750,000 over its two-day release on the first weekend of the new year. In Europe, the film was aired in Poland and Russia. In the UK, 18,600 fans watched Sherlock on the big screen despite the episode airing simultaneously on BBC1. The Abominable Bride drew a total consolidated TV audience of 11.6 million, making it by far the most popular show over the festive period. Doctor Who is made in-house by the BBC and has become one of BBC Worldwideâ€™s bestselling shows.

              "  'The view on British politics after Brexit The seismic political upheavals triggered by Juneâ€™s calamitous vote to leave the European Union have greatly intensified in recent days, with the Tories at their conference in Birmingham following Labour and Ukip in a frantic, often divisive and persistently contradictory drive to identify and occupy the elusive â€œnew centre groundâ€\\x9d of British politics. The most striking aspect of this struggle is that, in seeking to capitalise on the post-referendum state of flux, politicians in both main parties are paradoxically moving sharply away from the middle. In doing so, they set at risk fundamental liberal values and the universal, progressive principles that Britain, since the 18th-century Age of the Enlightenment, has been instrumental in spreading around the globe and in which its modern-day democracy and open society are rooted. Theresa Mayâ€™s first major speech as Conservative prime minister was intriguing for its renunciation of Thatcherismâ€™s pernicious but still pervasive emphasis on individualism and antisocial self-interest. Taken by itself, this public recanting is as welcome as it is overdue. May stressed instead her intention to use the power of government to change and improve peopleâ€™s lives, lauding â€œthe good the state can doâ€\\x9d. But in anointing herself as standard-bearer for the interests of what she patronisingly called â€œordinary peopleâ€\\x9d, May tottered on the edge of the old Benthamite trap of suggesting she and her ministers know what is best for everyone. They should tread carefully. In a parliamentary democracy, overweening executive authority, convinced of its own moral rightness, is a creature to be feared, not admired, as Americaâ€™s founding fathers knew full well when they built checks and balances into the US constitution. Even as the Tories dream lazily of ruling in perpetuity, the rational parts of their brains must surely understand that Mayâ€™s old school, top-down, take-whatâ€™s-good-for-you governance is neither desirable, democratic or effective. If May really believes they can become â€œthe party of the workers, the party of public servants, the party of the NHSâ€\\x9d, she must learn to talk to those workers, not down to them â€“ and listen before leaping on issues such as grammar schools and Hinkley Point. As a matter of respect and basic common sense, May should also heed the cautionary words of Thomas Paine, author of The Rights of Man, who wrote in 1792: â€œMankind, as it appears to me, are always ripe enough to understand their true interest, provided it be presented clearly to their understanding, and that in a manner not to create suspicion by anything like self-design, nor offend by assuming too much. Where we would wish to reform we must not reproach.â€\\x9d Worryingly, influential figures around May, pushing for a hard Brexit, are in danger of forgetting such wise maxims, assuming they were ever aware of them. What they call reform is unabashed regression and vengeful revisionism. There is a clear tendency, exhibited most brashly by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, to interpret the referendum result as unambiguous support for a divisive, rightwing agenda far removed from the political centre. It is worth restating that a thumping 48% of those who voted, or 16.1 million people, chose to Remain, while 28% of those eligible to vote expressed no opinion either way. That result places those actively backing Leave in a distinct minority. They should show a little humility. Instead, ignoring Paine and the majority, they assume too much. They dangerously overreach. Brexit did not, for example, provide a mandate for arbitrary restrictions on British-based companies hiring the best and brightest of foreign workers. In the integrated, globalised economy in which Fox claims a post-EU Britain will thrive, how shortsighted is that? Brexit was not a vote for British jobs for British workers, either, despite what Rudd insultingly implied. Many of the jobs in question are low skilled and badly paid; British-born workers simply do not want them. Some are demandingly high skilled, as in the NHS and care sectors, where there are critical shortages. Here, EU nationals perform vital work. Nor was Brexit a vote to trash one of modern Britainâ€™s great success stories â€“ its internationally admired university sector â€“ by limiting the numbers of foreign students who study here (and making it uncompetitively expensive for those who do). Already, the future of much joint research funding is in serious doubt. Notwithstanding vague government assurances about future financial support, Ruddâ€™s reckless comments will only compound damaging uncertainty. These and other noisome, ill-thought-out ideas, emanating from senior ministers bearing the seal of government, are as alarming as they are unpleasant. They carry a gross whiff of xenophobia. They convey an inescapable undertone of racism and intolerance. And they are a testament to what looks increasingly like an accelerating retreat from Britainâ€™s liberal, inclusive and open-minded tradition and a return to the narrow, delusional world of Little England. Despite much of what was said last week, Brexit was not a vote to scrap free access to the single market, thereby alienating Japanese and other overseas investors. Does Fox really think China, America or India will helpfully offer Britain, negotiating by itself, the same favourable terms that an EU bloc of 28 countries negotiating collectively has obtained? If he does, he should seek other work. Do these hard Brexiters truly believe our European partners will sit on their hands if Britain sets about demolishing EU founding pillars such as freedom of movement and goods? Do they honestly pretend Britain can continue to trade while rejecting agreed EU rules policed by the European court of justice? Do they somehow think British soldiers who commit war crimes should escape the sanction of European human rights conventions and international law? If they do, then dunderhead must be added to duplicity on the lengthening Brexiter charge sheet. FranÃ§ois Hollande, Franceâ€™s president, is a socialist, but no radical. He faces a fierce challenge from the hard right in next yearâ€™s elections. Yet swiftly responding to the messages coming out of Birmingham, Hollande reacted sharply last week. Britain must and will pay if it persists in such gratuitous vandalism, Hollande said. Viewed from the French, German and Italian mainstream, there is less and less to distinguish hard Brexiters from Marine Le Penâ€™s extremist Front National (which enthusiastically eggs them on) or the similarly xenophobic, nationalist Alternative for Germany. They are wreckers. They are reckless. They are irresponsible. They know only what they do not like. And they have little or no practical idea how they will replace the hard-won principles and institutions they traduce. Whatever these delusional Tories believe, theirs is not the path to Britainâ€™s new centre ground. Yet Labour, too, seems to have wholly lost its way as it struggles with internal divisions and the mortal threat to its working-class heartlands posed by Ukip. Rarely has the country required a purposeful, effective opposition as badly as it does now. Rarely if ever has there been such urgent need of a champion ready to defend workersâ€™ rights, regardless of race or nationality, to fight for the values of tolerance, inclusion and equality embodied in the European treaties and to lead those who feel threatened by mass migration, job insecurity, poverty and globalisation towards a broader understanding of who their real enemies are. Stand up, Jeremy Corbyn, newly re-elected Labour leader. Except, on Europe, the defining issue of our time, Corbyn has consistently failed to stand up, show a lead or demonstrate an appreciation of the wider issues. Yes, more social housing is important. Yes, a higher minimum would be nice. Yes, the railways are a mess. But this is hardly the point. Without a prosperous economy and expanding tax take, such policies will remain as unfunded wishful thinking. And if a hard Brexit takes hold, pushed through arbitrarily from next March onwards while a blinkered Corbyn vainly squabbles with his MPs and parliament is sidelined, much current public spending may be at risk, let alone any new programmes. Corbyn must now demonstrate that he is the man to rise to this pre-eminently urgent national challenge. The line of attack is clear. It is not unpatriotic, as May & co perniciously suggest, to want this country to remain close to the EU and play as full a part as possible within Europe. It is not supercilious or elitist to suggest many Leave voters were egregiously misled about the consequences of Brexit by Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. It is only right to be concerned that this new administration is using Brexit as a means to foist a divisive rightwing agenda on the country. It is deeply worrying that, as a result, the Brexit process may be botched and our national interests, and our people, will consequently suffer across the board. On one point, all perhaps can agree: this political crisis is about taking back control. But Brussels is not the enemy. The EU was always a straw man. Nor is the crisis about a loss of community, native culture and traditions, as some maintain. In all respects, these aspects of our national life are thriving, although they are evolving in ways some conservatives do not like. No, this crisis is about reasserting and deepening democratic governance on behalf of all the people while limiting the control and excesses of those who, by one means or another, exercise power over us. Just as in the time of Tom Paine and the American and French revolutions, it is a battle for equality, justice and tolerance, for the proud liberal principles of individual freedom, openness and inclusion. It is a struggle between the forces of reaction, prejudice, ignorance, dogmatism and self-interest and the universal vision of progressive societies in which the rights of all men and women are respected and advanced. It is an ongoing historical contest that everyone who cares about a fairer society must now steel themselves to fight again â€“ and by all means, win. For here, not on Brexitâ€™s wilder shores, is where Britainâ€™s centre ground truly lies. This article was amended on 22 October 2016 to clarify EU Referendum voting percentages.',\n",
              "  'State of the 2016 race: Trump looks to take over America after conquering GOP Impossible, unthinkable, probable and now inevitable â€“ Donald Trump has swept through American politics like a hurricane, upending conventional wisdom and trailing destruction in his wake. On Thursday, the ultimate celebrity candidate clinched the Republican nomination for president, setting up what could be one of the ugliest general elections in memory. Trump reached the magic number of delegates needed after a small number of the partyâ€™s unbound delegates told the Associated Press they would support him at the Republican National Convention in July. With zero political experience, Trump knocked out 16 rivals including governors and senators as he grabbed more primary votes than any Republican in modern history. Asked at a press conference in Bismarck, North Dakota, how it felt to reach the magic number, Trump said: â€œIâ€™m so honored. Iâ€™m so honored by these people; they had such great sense.â€\\x9d Earlier he remarked: â€œWe were supposed to be going into July ... and here I am watching Hillary and she canâ€™t close the deal.â€\\x9d His hostile takeover of the party complete, the bombastic, swaggering, at times crass billionaire now hopes to complete a takeover of America itself. The 69-year-old will almost certainly face Democrat Hillary Clinton, 68, in the November election. The pair are running neck and neck in opinion polls. Pundits who laughingly dismissed Trump as a buffoon when he entered the race nearly a year ago are not laughing now. â€œItâ€™s not only unprecedented but unfathomable,â€\\x9d said Rich Galen, former press secretary to vice-president Dan Quayle. â€œIf youâ€™d written a novel based on whatâ€™s happened since last June, youâ€™d have had to self-publish because no publishing house would have touched it.â€\\x9d Many Americans, and observers around the world, have watched the resistible rise of Trump with consternation just eight years after the US elected its first black president. Some believe that he embodies a racially charged backlash against Barack Obama and the last gasp of white men against the nationâ€™s diversifying demographic. One theory holds that he is merely putting into plain, populist language what rightwing Republicans have been saying in code for years. â€œThe Donaldâ€\\x9d has been variously compared to everyone from Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini to newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst and showman PT Barnum. He has sold himself as a charismatic leader, a dealmaker and a winner, taking a wrecking ball to the political establishment. Democratic strategist Bob Shrum said this week: â€œHe is a classic untrammeled demagogue.â€\\x9d Trump was probably best known in the US as the presenter of the American version of The Apprentice when, last June, he launched his long-shot presidential campaign at the shiny, marbled Trump Tower in New York. When, after descending an escalator, the property developer said of Mexicans, â€œTheyâ€™re bringing drugs. Theyâ€™re bringing crime. Theyâ€™re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,â€\\x9d the tone was set and the 2016 presidential race would never quite be the same again. Trump demolished the Republican field, throwing out nicknames that stuck: â€œLittle Marcoâ€\\x9d Rubio, â€œLow energyâ€\\x9d Jeb Bush and â€œLyinâ€™ Tedâ€\\x9d Cruz. Some tried to rise above him, and others tried to wrestle him in the mud; all fell in their turn. Questions have been raised over the culpability of the media in giving him millions of dollarsâ€™ worth of free publicity; his campaign costs were a relatively low $57m by the end of April. Trump has fired up his base, and infuriated liberal opponents, by promising to build a wall along the Mexican border, round up and deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country because of fear of terrorism. His rallies are rowdy and raucous, with huge crowds wearing his trademark Make America Great Again hats, chanting, â€œBuild the wall!â€\\x9d and holding placards that say, â€œThe silent majority stands with Trumpâ€\\x9d. They have attracted protests, too, with demonstrators sometimes forcibly ejected and Trump himself stoking an ominous violence. One rally in Chicago was canceled after thousands of demonstrators surrounded the venue and the secret service could no longer guarantee the candidateâ€™s safety. Trump, whose mother was born in Stornoway in the Hebrides â€“ what he once described as â€œserious Scotlandâ€\\x9d â€“ has been condemned as anti-women, anti-immigrant and anti-poor. He still faces a battle to unify the Republican party, although some leaders, encouraged by his poll numbers against Clinton, have thrown in their lot with him, as has media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, said on Thursday: â€œItâ€™s unfortunate that the Grand Old Party of Reagan and Lincoln has turned to a charlatan, and itâ€™s our job to make sure, for the sake of the Latino community, the Asian American community, the African American community, and every American that we stop Hurricane Trump from invading the White House and that we continue to build upon the progress that has been made for hardworking Americans under Barack Obama.â€\\x9d The Republican could benefit from a split among Democrats between Clinton, criticised for a peculiarly joyless campaign, and the partyâ€™s own surprise insurgent, socialist Bernie Sanders. But Jeffries insisted: â€œIt is certainly the case that in 2016 weâ€™re going to come together to defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous threat to democracy as we know it that the United States has seen in recent history.â€\\x9d With Sanders fighting to the end, and Clinton hoping to avoid a symbolically wounding loss in California next month, Trump has the luxury of watching from a lofty perch. He needed 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination and has now reached 1,238. With 303 delegates at stake in five state primaries on 7 June, Trump will comfortably boost his total, avoiding a contested party convention in Cleveland. The fact that Clinton stands to become Americaâ€™s first female president has almost become an afterthought in the wild ride of this yearâ€™s campaign. She suffered a blow on Wednesday when an official report found that she violated department rules on email use by setting up a private server during her time as secretary of state. Trump has branded her â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€\\x9d and has already drawn attention to the past sexual indiscretions of her husband Bill Clinton during his own time at the White House. Commentators fear the race can only turn nastier. Trump has married three times, loves junk food, enjoys watching sports on TV and is a particular fan of Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s film Pulp Fiction. Gaffes and media revelations that would have sunk a normal candidate in a normal year appear to bounce off him. What does not kill him makes him stronger. Yet he has some headaches of his own. He is under mounting pressure to release his tax returns. Hours before clinching the nomination, he announced the abrupt departure of political director Rick Wiley, who had been leading a push to hire staff in key battleground states. This was the latest evidence of a power struggle within the Trump campaign. Galen, a veteran Republican strategist, believes that Trump will win the presidency, riding a wave of anger at the status quo. â€œThe anti-Washington sentiment is real,â€\\x9d he said. â€œPeople are showing on a definitive basis that they would rather take a risk on someone like Trump who has no skills than the cronies like me who do it over and over again, just exchanging desks in the west wing every eight years. They are saying, â€˜Youâ€™ve screwed it up, weâ€™ll take a chance with this guy.â€™â€\\x9d Asked about liberal warnings that Trump cannot be trusted with democracy, security or the nuclear trigger, Galen, 69, replied: â€œIâ€™m old enough to remember the same thing being said about Ronald Reagan. They underestimated him because he was an actor and was not a member of the club. So letâ€™s see what happens.â€\\x9d Key milestones in the US election race: California primary: 7 June is the final major primary night for the 2016 election, with California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana and the Dakotas all voting and Clinton all but certain to claim the delegates she needs to cross the line and become the Democratic nominee. California is the biggest prize in the season, with 548 Democratic delegates and 172 Republicans up for grabs. Currently, RealClearPolitics aggregate polls show Clinton ahead at 50% to Sandersâ€™ 42%. However, Sanders has been holding massive rallies across the state â€“ with seven more planned for this weekend â€“ and is hoping for a strong showing to help him influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention. Democratic convention: The 2016 DNC will be held in Philadelphia on 25-28 July, where the party delegates will confirm the presidential nominee, with Sanders supporters hopeful they may be able to convince super delegates â€“ party insiders who can vote however they want â€“ to switch their allegiance from Clinton to their candidate, which seems unlikely. Sanders said this week the convention could be â€œmessyâ€\\x9d: â€œDemocracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle but that is where the Democratic party should go.â€\\x9d Republican convention: On the GOP side, the Republican National Convention will take place in Cleveland 18-21 July, where they will officially select Trump as the partyâ€™s presidential nominee. Trump agreed to a joint fundraising deal with the RNC this week â€“ previously his campaign had been self-funded â€“ and Republicans are already debating how many of Trumpâ€™s controversial policies will make itâ€™s way into the partyâ€™s platform First presidential debate: The two nominees will go directly head to head at the first presidential debate on 26 September in Dayton, Ohio, a key swing state. Tuesday 8 November: US election. The bookies are shortening their odds on a Trump presidency, with William Hill dropping to 7/4 and Paddy Power offering 2/1 for a Trump win. â€“ Amber Jamieson in New York',\n",
              "  'Patients with long-term conditions need a joined-up NHS Transforming the care of long-term conditions is the key to ensuring the financial sustainability of the NHS. But although there is wide agreement on what needs to change, progress towards achieving it is painfully slow. The seven innovation test beds unveiled by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month are the latest attempt to build some momentum behind change. The programme is focused on long-term conditions and mental health, and is a collaboration between the NHS and some big private sector names including Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences), IBM and Philips. The idea is to use a mix of technology, data, monitoring and training. Examples include diabetes patients in the west of England having remote monitoring and coaching technology to help them manage their condition better, while in Rochdale, patients who are at high risk of becoming critically ill will be supported with telecare monitoring in their homes. These are all good ideas, of course, but it says a lot about the way the NHS struggles with adopting innovations at scale and pace that so much fanfare was given to such a modest development. With so many conflicting pressures in the NHS, there is a risk that improving the management of long-term conditions will slip as a priority; the NHS planning guidance 2016/17 â€“ 2020/21 (pdf) published in December makes scant mention of long-term conditions, while cancer and mental health have moved to the fore. All these services overlap, but the difference in emphasis is clear. However, patients with long-term conditions should eventually benefit from the move in the guidance towards NHS bodies planning and operating as health and care systems rather than discrete organisations. The devolution deals also hold out the promise of improvements in the integration of health and social care. Among the new models of care emerging from the Five Year Forward View, two in particular promise better support for long-term conditions. Multispecialty community providers have the potential to pull together more effective packages of care for their patients â€“ from consultant physicians prised out of their hospitals to pharmacists and community nurses â€“ and start to shift the centre of gravity for diagnosis, treatment and support into the community. Central to this is a step change in the working relationship between the hospital consultants and GPs. It is a continuing scandal that, in many areas, patients still suffer because of poor collaboration between secondary and primary care doctors. While accountable care organisations (ACOs) are certainly not a panacea, the move to bring together care services in Northumberland as an ACO from 2017 may well offer the most promising model for keeping patients with long-term conditions active, independent and out of hospital for as long as possible. Morecambe Bay and the Isle of Wight are pursuing a similar approach. Northumberland already has an impressive record for health and social care services working together. As one of the NHS England â€œvanguardâ€\\x9d sites it now plans to take that a stage further, with more active management of the populationâ€™s health, better access to services and more effective and widespread use of technology. If the accountable care model starts to get traction, perhaps its greatest benefit will be a psychological one. By blurring the boundaries between primary, community, social and hospital care, patients may in time come to realise that arriving in hospital is often a sign that care has failed, not that it is succeeding. That change in perception will be crucial if the NHS is ever to succeed in rebalancing its resources between hospitals and everything else. There are numerous uplifting stories of patients maintaining active, largely independent lives by managing their own condition with integrated, multidisciplinary support. But too often, the story is of missed opportunities, poor coordination and crisis intervention. Substantial improvements in the care of long-term conditions must remain at the heart of NHS planning.

              "  'RBS admits further delays in offloading Williams & Glyn Royal Bank of Scotland is facing further problems in offloading 300 Williams & Glyn branches, in a fresh blow to the management team of the bailed-out bank. The European Union demanded the branches be separated as the price of agreeing to RBSâ€™s Â£45bn taxpayer bailout. Lloyds Banking Group was also required under state aid rules to carve out TSB in return for its government rescue. But on Thursday, the Edinburgh-based RBS said the cost of the spin-out, previously put at Â£1.2bn, was escalating and it may miss the deadline to complete the disposal â€“ which had already been extended to December 2017. This may make it even more difficult for the chancellor, George Osborne, to further reduce the governmentâ€™s 73% stake in the bank. Spinning out the Williams & Glyn branches has already created difficulty for RBS. A sale to Santander was abandoned in 2012 and a subsequent deal was announced in 2013 with a consortium backed by investments from the Church of England to try to complete the separation. Then late last year RBS said it might also consider an auction for the branches. Shares in the bank fell almost 5%, to 240p â€“ well below the 502p at which taxpayers break even on their stake. â€œDue to the complexities of Williams & Glynâ€™s customer and product mix, the programme to create a cloned banking platform continues to be very challenging and the timetable to achieve separation is uncertain,â€\\x9d RBS said. â€œWe have concluded that there is a significant risk that the separation and divestment to which we are committed will not be achieved by 31 December 2017. RBS is exploring alternative means to achieve separation and divestment. The overall financial impact on RBS is now likely to be significantly greater than previously estimated.â€\\x9d Ross McEwan, who became chief executive in October 2013, is expected to face questions on the problems when he presents the bankâ€™s first-quarter figures on Friday. The announcement was rushed out to the market after the board of the bank â€“ which has not made an annual profit since 2007 â€“ had met to discuss the first-quarter trading statement. Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies, said: â€œWe struggle to comprehend what management have learned about the separation business since their last update to the market on 26 February and also that the separation of this business has been under way since late 2009. The news is negative on two fronts: a potential delay in capital return and also likely higher separation costs. Moreover the delays could call into question management execution of RBSâ€™s restructuring process.â€\\x9d Analysts are expected to want clarity on any impact on the possibility of payouts to shareholders â€“ currently expected next year. Lloyds, which admitted on Thursday its first quarter profits had fallen by 46% to Â£654m, has separated out 600 TSB branches, created a new image on the high street and floated the bank on the stock market before it was sold to Sabadell of Spain last year. TSB relies on Lloyds for its IT, despite being a separate bank, while RBS is trying to create a standalone branch network.',\n",
              "  'Chris Rock: five of his best moments While the reaction to Chris Rockâ€™s last stint as Oscar host was somewhat muted, hopes are high that the comedian will be able to add some much-needed edge to this weekâ€™s ceremony. Most are curious to see just how far Rock will push boundaries, given the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. But, while we wait to see if he will crash or soar, hereâ€™s a look back at some of his best moments on screen. Iâ€™m Gonna Git You Sucka Before Keenen Ivory Wayansâ€™ handle on silliness got out of control in dross such as White Chicks and Dance Flick, he displayed a niftier touch for boisterous humour in this inventive blaxploitation parody. A 23-year-old Rock cropped up in a small but memorable role as a man desperate for ribs but unwilling to pay for a full rack. New Jack City It might not feel as sharp-edged as it did in 1991, but Mario Van Peeblesâ€™ violent gangster drama showcased an impressive cast from Wesley Snipes to Ice-T. But Rockâ€™s crack addict-turned-informant Pookie was an effortless scene-stealer in a performance that provided both serious and comic moments. Good Hair In 2009, Rock added another string to his bow by writing and starring in this revealing documentary about African Americansâ€™ hair. Rock proved to be a smart and curious tour guide, shining a light on a $9bn industry without turning it into a polemic or resorting to condescension. His talent for the field should be explored further. 2 Days in New York While Julie Delpyâ€™s quick-witted relationship comedy 2 Days in Paris was undoubtedly fun, it didnâ€™t seem like a film that required a sequel. It was therefore a refreshing surprise that the follow-up was just as charming and cleverly observed as the first. Rock, playing a talkshow host and journalist, appears like an extension of himself. Top Five Emerging from the 2014 Toronto film festival with ecstatic reviews, audience buzz and a $12.5m deal from Paramount, Rockâ€™s major comeback film, which he also wrote and directed, seemed as if it would be a box-office hit, too. But it sort of fizzled, which is a shame because itâ€™s a smart, funny and affectionate romantic comedy that was billed as Rockâ€™s Annie Hall. It sadly proved that his box-office appeal may now be reserved for Madagascar movies.',\n",
              "  'WHO warns against blood donations from people returning from Zika regions The World Health Organisation has advised countries against accepting blood donations from people who have travelled to regions affected by the Zika virus, as Spain announced Europeâ€™s first known case of the disease in a pregnant woman. The announcement came as authorities in Brazil disclosed two cases of transmission tied to blood transfusions, adding a new dimension to efforts to limit Zikaâ€™s impact. With dozens of cases emerging in Europeans and North Americans returning from Zika-affected areas, the WHO stressed the potential link between Zika and microcephaly â€“ which causes children to be born with abnormally small heads â€“ and urged health authorities to take precautions. â€œWith the risk of incidence of new infections of Zika virus in many countries, and the potential linkage of the Zika virus infection with microcephaly and other clinical consequence, it is estimated as an appropriate precautionary measures to defer [blood] donors who return from areas with Zika virus outbreak,â€\\x9d the WHO told AFP in a statement on Thursday. The virus, which has spread quickly across Latin America and the Caribbean, is usually transmitted by the bite of a mosquito, although health authorities in Texas this week reported a case which had been transmitted through sexual contact. Marcelo Addas Carvalho, the doctor who is the director of the blood center at the University of Campinas near Sao Paulo, said genetic testing confirmed that a man who received a blood transfusion using blood donated by another man infected with Zika in March 2015 became infected with the virus, although he did not develop symptoms. Carvalho said another man, who had suffered gunshot wounds, also became infected with Zika after receiving multiple blood transfusions that included blood donated by an infected person in April 2015. Carvalho said that infection probably was caused by the transfusion but genetic tests have not yet been conducted to confirm it. He said it was very unlikely the infection was caused by a mosquito bite because the patient was in a hospital intensive care unit for three months. The patient later died from his gunshot wounds and not the Zika infection, health officials and Carvalho said. â€œTransmission of the virus through blood transfusion is very rare and not an important factor in the epidemic. Governments and society in general should focus on eliminating the mosquito, which is the main form of transmission,â€\\x9d Carvalho said. Meanwhile, in the first case of its kind in Europe, Spainâ€™s health ministry said a pregnant woman who had returned from Colombia had been diagnosed with the virus. â€œOne of the patients diagnosed in (the north-eastern region of) Catalonia is a pregnant woman, who showed symptoms after having travelled to Colombia,â€\\x9d the ministry announced, adding that she was one of seven cases in Spain. The mosquito-borne virus has so far spread to 26 countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean and health authorities have warned it could infect up to four million people on the continent and spread worldwide. The disease starts with a mosquito bite and normally causes little more than a fever and rash. But since October, Brazil has reported 404 confirmed cases of microcephaly â€“ up from 147 in 2014 â€“ plus 3,670 suspected cases. The timing has fuelled strong suspicions that Zika is causing the birth defect. The virus has also been linked to a potentially paralysing nerve disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome in some patients. Spainâ€™s health ministry sought to ease concerns over the spread of the virus, pointing out that all seven cases in the country had caught the disease abroad. â€œUp to now, the diagnosed cases of Zika virus in Spain ... donâ€™t risk spreading the virus in our country as they are imported cases,â€\\x9d it said. The news comes a day after South American health ministers held an emergency meeting in Uruguay on the disease. The meeting focused on ways to control the mosquito population spreading the virus, though reports of a US patient catching the disease by having sex fuelled fears that it will not be easy to contain. WHO earlier this week declared the spike in serious birth defects an international emergency and launched a global Zika response unit. Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Jamaica and the US territory of Puerto Rico have all warned women not to get pregnant. The WHO warning on blood donations follows moves by Canada and Britain to protect their blood supplies. Canadian blood agencies on Wednesday announced that anyone who had travelled to a Zika-risk area would be ineligible to give blood for three weeks upon their return. The 21-day waiting period also applies to cord blood and stem cell donors who have travelled to Zika-affected areas. In Britain, the National Health Service Blood and Transplant agency has said that from Thursday, anyone returning from Zika-affected countries would be made to wait 28 days before being allowed to donate blood, as a â€œprecautionary measureâ€\\x9d.

              "  'Rod Temperton obituary Those who pore over the writing credits on album sleeves know the name of the songwriter Rod Temperton, who has died of cancer aged 66. But despite his huge hits for Michael Jackson, above all the title track for Thriller, he was so low-profile that he was nicknamed the â€œinvisible manâ€\\x9d. His compositional skills led to him writing three songs for Jacksonâ€™s 1979 album Off the Wall, which went on to sell more than 20m copies. In 1982, he wrote three of the nine songs on Jacksonâ€™s Thriller, including the title track, and his contributions helped the album to shift 65m copies and become the biggest seller of all time. Temperton, who had previously been a member of the funk-disco band Heatwave, was recruited to the Jackson team by producer Quincy Jones in 1978, as Jones was preparing to record Off the Wall. Temperton formed a fruitful partnership with Jones and the recording engineer Bruce Swedien, prompting the three of them to be dubbed the A-Team. â€œIâ€™d never heard Heatwave until Quincy told me about them,â€\\x9d Swedien recalled. â€œRod was like Beethoven â€“ when he would bring a demo in the studio, every detail was complete.â€\\x9d Of the songs Temperton wrote for Off the Wall, the title track reached the Top 10 of the US Billboard pop chart, while Rock With You topped it. Both were Top 10 hits in Britain. His third track, Burn This Disco Out, was released as the B-side of Beat It. When Thriller was recorded three years later, Temperton was seen as indispensable by Jones. â€œQuincy said, â€˜Well, you came up with the title of the last album, see what you can do for this albumâ€™,â€\\x9d Temperton recalled in a 2006 interview for Radio 2, describing how he wrote Thriller. â€œI went back to the hotel. I wrote two or three hundred titles for this song.â€\\x9d He toyed with the idea of calling it Midnight, before he hit upon Thriller. â€œSomething in my head just said â€˜this is the titleâ€™. You could visualise it on top of the Billboard charts ... So I knew I had to write it as Thriller, and I wrote all the words very quickly, then went to the studio and we did it.â€\\x9d It was also Tempertonâ€™s idea to include the macabre spoken word section at the end of the song: â€œOne thing Iâ€™d thought about was to have somebody, a famous voice in the horror genre, to do this vocal.â€\\x9d As luck would have it Jonesâ€™s wife was friendly with the actor Vincent Price. He was delighted to be offered the job. Temperton wrote out the text in a cab on his way to the recording session, Price (who took a flat fee) did only two takes, and the result entered into music industry folklore. The album also featured the Temperton songs Baby Be Mine and The Lady in My Life; only Jackson himself contributed more numbers. The songwriterâ€™s journey to the centre of the West Coast entertainment business began in the Lincolnshire seaside resort of Cleethorpes, where he was born. He would later describe how his father put a transistor radio on his pillow when he was a child and he would fall asleep listening to the pop station Radio Luxembourg. He attended De Aston school in Market Rasen, where he formed a band in which he was the drummer. On leaving school he worked for a time at the Ross Foods frozen fish factory in Grimsby. Meanwhile he persevered as a musician. Switching from drums to keyboards, he played in several dance bands and in the early 1970s moved to Germany. With guitarist Bernd Springer he formed a band called Sundown Carousel, which played soul music covers in bars and GI clubs across Germany. In 1974, having also been part of a group called The Hammer, he replied to an advert in the Melody Maker that had been placed by Johnnie Wilder Jr. He had sung with a number of groups while serving with the US army in West Germany and was putting together a new outfit. The band began performing in London as Chicagoâ€™s Heatwave before shortening their name to Heatwave, adding a funk beat to their disco sound and signing to GTO Records in 1976. They recorded a debut album, Too Hot to Handle, and in 1977 their third single from it, Boogie Nights (written by Temperton, as were all the songs on the album), reached No 2 on both the UK chart and the Billboard Hot 100. â€œIâ€™ve always tried to write my music with an American flavour and really Boogie Nights is the most universal song Iâ€™ve written,â€\\x9d he said at the time. The follow-up single, the ballad Always and Forever, reached the UK Top 10 and climbed to 18 on the Billboard pop chart. Luther Vandross recorded a version of it for his album Songs (1994). A second album, Central Heating, appeared in 1978, and another Temperton composition, The Groove Line, delivered another US Top 10 hit. It was in 1978 that Temperton decided to leave the group to concentrate on songwriting, though he would continue to contribute material to Heatwave. He soon received his priceless opportunity with Jackson and became a writer for countless major artists. Among his credits are George Bensonâ€™s most successful single, Give Me the Night (1980), from the album of the same name, various contributions to Jonesâ€™s The Dude (1981), and several co-writing credits on Donna Summerâ€™s album Donna Summer; Baby, Come To Me for Patti Austin and James Ingram; and tracks on Herbie Hancockâ€™s Lite Me Up (all 1982). He also wrote for Manhattan Transfer, Siedah Garrett, Aretha Franklin, Jeffrey Osborne, Karen Carpenter, Mica Paris and many more. In 1986 he was nominated for the Oscar for best original song for the track Miss Celieâ€™s Blues, which he had co-written with Lionel Richie and Jones for the film The Color Purple. Temperton also wrote five songs for the Billy Crystal movie Running Scared (1986). He remained self-effacing, though his success funded homes in Los Angeles, the south of France, Fiji, Switzerland and Britain. Tongue in cheek he summed up: â€œI watch telly, catch up on the news, and maybe the phone will ring.â€\\x9d He is survived by his wife, Kathy. â€¢ Rodney Lynn Temperton, songwriter, musician and producer, born 9 October 1949; death announced 5 October 2016',\n",
              "  'Referendum campaign lacked evidence, but the fallout must not Itâ€™s hard to gauge the full scale of the decision to leave the EU, but while public services must be prepared for several years of uncertainty, it is crucial that we carry out a detailed analysis of public finances before making any decisions. Not only will the UK extract itself from EU law and protocols while commencing bilateral trade agreements around the world, but also face a likely second vote on the future of the UK, too. A new prime minister, and probably a new leader of the opposition, must grapple with this and public rejection of the present deal between our institutions and communities. Donâ€™t understate how time-consuming this will be. For public services, financial uncertainties will limit confidence to invest in the medium term. There are many questions to be answered, including whether EU funds will be replaced when funding is repatriated to Westminster; whether devolution and new funding models, of which George Osborne has been the architect, will be as great a priority under a new chancellor; and whether it will be harder to attract European staff to our hospitals and schools before itâ€™s clear how we want our borders to change. Around 50,000 NHS staff, 4.5% of the total workforce, are from the European Economic Area, and the Commons public accounts committee has already raised concerns that the NHS is struggling with a shortage of about 50,000 clinical staff. But while the deckchairs move after the referendum, the ship of globalisation, new technologies and new ways of working continue to make the world a smaller and more joined-up place. Public services need to learn from others. UK cities and regions will want their economic development aspirations to align with European opportunities, even though we will leave the EU. Government ministers and public servants alike must avoid knee-jerk reactions that could do more harm than good in this rapidly changing situation. If the campaign was one of claim and counter claim, often a lacking in evidence, the execution of next steps must be thorough, clear, honest and considered. Nigel Farageâ€™s admission on Friday that claims of future additional NHS funding from the UKâ€™s EU contribution were â€œa mistakeâ€\\x9d highlights the fact that public service leaders will not know how their finances will stack up. And if the subsequent fall in markets means that the gap of many pension liabilities have grown, any future claims that public sector funds are not being managed well will be met with derision from exasperated finance directors. In the build up to the referendum, we at Cipfa interviewed public sector leaders, including chief financial officers and chief executives. They believed the EU provided a source of greatly needed skills and expertise. They also appreciated support networks within the EU, which they felt powered research and allowed practitioners to share knowledge. These sort of collaborative relationships must continue. The crime and security sectors, for instance, would keenly feel the absence in responding to cross-border crime. But public sector leaders saw drawbacks of the EU, too. For example, immigration has been placing great strain on local services in certain areas. And clearly from the referendum we see that immigration in its present form is dividing our nation. Our research also demonstrated that EU regulations are at times over the top â€“ for example, in restricting business rate relief that may assist growth. So there are opportunities to give more powers to incentivise local economies. A key question, with no present answer, is whether Westminster will repatriate from Brussels to itself through greater centralisation or devolve more to local solutions. Finally, Britain is deeply divided by geography and class. Take those with degrees voting one way and those without voting another as an example. From my experience of leading public bodies, I donâ€™t believe that â€œtaking back controlâ€\\x9d is a philosophical debate for many communities, but is their proxy for the better housing, skills, jobs, pay and hope they desperately want. Public services face uncertainty and challenges, in the face of which they must basically keep calm and carry on. Their vision, funding and capabilities will be a key determinant of whether we heal our divided nation over the next decade.

Central European News, founded and run by British journalist Michael Leidig, has launched a US legal action claiming that BuzzFeedâ€™s 7,000-word article deliberately set out to damage its business. The article, published in April last year, alleged that the agency frequently runs attention-grabbing stories that are â€œoften inaccurate or downright falseâ€\\x9d. CEN and Leidig allege that BuzzFeed maliciously intended to damage the news agency in order to â€œobtain a greater share of the market for viral news in Great Britain and elsewhere around the worldâ€\\x9d. They are seeking $5m each, as well as a further $1.04m for lost business opportunities, and further punitive damages. â€œThe BuzzFeed story accuses Mr Leidig, an experienced and award-winning journalist, of the worst thing you can accuse a journalist of â€“ fraud,â€\\x9d said Harry Wise, the New York-based lawyer representing CEN and Leidig. â€œIt is unfortunate that BuzzFeed refuses to recognise that its story is completely unfounded, and has done terrible damage to Mr Leidig and his company. We look forward to demonstrating those things in court.â€\\x9d Leidig, CENâ€™s chief executive, claims that when BuzzFeed originally contacted him about writing a piece it was under the guise of wanting to write a feature on CENâ€™s â€œlaudable investigative journalismâ€\\x9d. He launched his legal action after failing to get BuzzFeed UK to remove the article. â€œI wrote to BuzzFeedâ€™s newly appointed editor Janine Gibson offering to settle this without any money needing to change hands, if they removed the article and apologised,â€\\x9d said Leidig. â€œAt that stage it might still have been possible to rescue certain investments and undo the damage. This olive branch was ignored and as BuzzFeed is not regulated by any independent body, the only alternative was to take legal action.â€\\x9d CEN says the article has had major ramifications for its business. It said that the Daily Mirror, its second biggest client, said it would now use CEN stories only â€œif it was absolutely necessaryâ€\\x9d. â€œ[The Daily Mirror] is now using CEN again, but at a much-reduced level from the period before defendantâ€™s publication,â€\\x9d said CEN in its 16-page legal filing. CEN said that sales of stories, which generally hovered around 900 a month before the BuzzFeed article was published, have dropped by about 30%. The company also says it lost a â€œpotential high six-figure investmentâ€\\x9d as a result of the article. â€œWeâ€™re aware the suit was filed, but we donâ€™t comment on potential litigation,â€\\x9d said a BuzzFeed spokesman.',\n",
              "  'Three Bristol University students die within weeks of term starting A coroner is investigating the circumstances surrounding the sudden deaths of three students, all believed to be first years, at one of Britainâ€™s top universities within weeks of the new academic year beginning. Though the causes of the deaths will have to be established by the Avon coroner, online tribute and fundraising pages for two of the three suggested they had taken their own lives. The University of Bristol said the deaths were not being treated as suspicious and were not connected but it would carry out its own investigations to find out if lessons could be learned. According to a survey by the National Union of Students (NUS) published last year, eight out of 10 students said they had experienced mental health issues in the previous year and a third said they had had suicidal thoughts. One of the students who died has been named as Miranda Williams, 19, from Chichester, who was just three weeks into her first term. An online fundraising page set up to raise money for the charity Papyrus, which works to prevent young people from killing themselves, said Miranda had died three days after she â€œdecided to take her own lifeâ€\\x9d. A message on the page said: â€œMiranda suffered with depression and anxiety a lot of her teenage life â€¦ We blame the stigma of her illness for her death. It restricted the help she got, the support and the understanding.â€\\x9d She was studying philosophy and was a member of the Jazz Funk Soul Bristol society, according to an email to students from the studentsâ€™ union announcing her death. It said support was available for students and added: â€œShock, grief and understanding what has happened will affect us all differently. â€œIt is important to let this happen in its own time. Talk to each other, to your school, to your residence pastoral team and to your friends.â€\\x9d The second first year student who died was the law student Kim Long, 18, from Penzance in Cornwall. On an online tribute page his family wrote: â€œWe have lost our dearest, loveliest and only son. Kim took his own life last week. He was considerate to the end by leaving us a loving letter which helps us to respect and accept his choice. May he rest in peace.â€\\x9d A university spokesperson said: â€œSadly we can confirm there have been three unrelated student deaths this term. These events are always extremely upsetting and our thoughts are with the studentsâ€™ families and friends. â€œOur student welfare services are offering support to anyone affected. It would be inappropriate for us to comment on the cause of these deaths until the coroner has undertaken independent inquests, although we understand that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding them. â€œThe University of Bristol has around 22,000 students. We will, of course, be investigating if there is anything we need to do to learn from these sad events but we have no reason to believe they represent a wider issue.â€\\x9d Bristol University studentsâ€™ unionâ€™s student living officer, Stephen LeFanu, said the organisation was working hard to improve pastoral care. He said: â€œStarting university can be extremely difficult. Some new students are without their support networks from home for the first time, and will be experiencing new academic and social pressures. â€œRising fees mean that students are also increasingly under a great deal of financial pressure, with many taking on part-time work alongside their studies. Many people will also experience complex mental health difficulties, regardless of their environment.â€\\x9d In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.',\n",
              "  'Grimes live review â€“ big bass, even bigger hooks It is only when you witness this much unfettered female joy on stage that you realise how rarely it is that you see it. Grimesâ€™s feral K-pop rave is easily the best thing to be run through a mixing desk this year, maybe longer. It is every kind of awesome. Shrieks greet the atmospheric introductory passage, Laughing and Not Being Normal, that opens Grimesâ€™s most recent album, Art Angels, and her set. Grimes â€“ Claire Boucher, on her passport â€“ then lets loose the Japanese-themed melody from Genesis, off her previous album, 2012â€™s Visions. Flanking her are two fierce dancers, Alison and Linda, who recall the Security of the First World, Public Enemyâ€™s old pseudo-paramilitary helpmeets, crossed with ninjas. Soon, sheâ€™s unleashing gut-juddering sub-bass for Realiti, crunchier, and weirder than on record. She starts Flesh Without Blood off conducting the air, strumming a guitar riff and then singing about a false friendship in a bubblegum coo. â€œGot a doll that looks like you,â€\\x9d she smiles meaningfully. Bittersweet hook after bittersweet hook plays out on her gear. The bass is carnivorously loud; HANA, Boucherâ€™s support act-cum-band member, whacks drum pads and tosses her plaited horsetail around. The tune is huge. Everywhere you look, there are women dancing. That pop music can be done with so much sweet, kaleidoscopic ferocity comes as a shock after a lifetime of regretfully accepting that the dead-eyed Britney version was the only way mainstream pop could work. There is no doubt that Miley Cyrus is having a ball, but you can still just see the marionette strings when she moves. Seeing Grimes tour Art Angels, her fourth and most accessible album (released last November), is like entering a parallel universe, where riot grrrl won the World Cup, where the K-pop-worshipping PC Music scene (Sophie et al) gained control of the means of production, currently hogged by a small cabal of producers who might not have the best interests of pop starlets at heart, where Peaches is as big as Madonna. Grimes the cult producer used to stay glued conscientiously to her equipment. In her new incarnation, she spends an hour bounding dementedly around, head-banging, running back to her workstation to start the next beat, play a keyboard line or trigger a sample. The stage set is as cheap as you like, what look like army surplus tarpaulins lit from beneath in lurid pinks and yellows, or strafed by lasers. When sheâ€™s not singing, Grimes cradles the microphone in the crook of her neck like a phone, both hands feverishly organising the live bits of the showâ€™s playback. And so it goes on, euphorically, menacingly, with Grimes mixing what she calls â€œdeep cutsâ€\\x9d (mostly songs off her previous album, Visions) with the bulk of Art Angels, everything marinated in an enhancing dry rub of MSG cut with PCP. A big red bow controlling a mane of blond hair, lurid turquoise T-shirt over cut-offs, she is possessed by gleeful energy. Then, between songs, Grimes becomes Boucher, a nervous young Canadian woman, embarrassed at the repeated pauses she has to take because the crowd wonâ€™t stop cheering, even when she asks us nicely. â€œStop it, it makes me stressed out, Iâ€™m very shy!â€\\x9d she blethers. Cue more screaming. The only thing to do is to start rapping in Russian â€“ the vocal to Scream, originally in Mandarin, by Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes. Later in the set, for Venus Fly, the songâ€™s martial rhythm section is multiplied tenfold. The build is monstrous; the drop, apocalyptic. The dancers have lasers shooting from their fingertips for a revamped version of Be a Body. For Go, a non-album cut that Grimes did with Blood Diamonds, they have daggers. Soon afterwards, Grimes apologises for having swallowed her own hair. Before Oblivion, she reminds us to hydrate, and not crush our peers. (The girl behind me has already fainted.) She plays her encore straight after the main set, because, thanks to her nerves, â€œOnce Iâ€™m goneâ€¦â€\\x9d Itâ€™s easily the most explosive track off Art Angels, Kill V Maim, which may (or may not) be about The Godfather if he were a gender-bending vampire. It features the keynote chorus: â€œHey, oh, donâ€™t behave.â€\\x9d Hosting the pop rave of your dreams, Grimes and her crew are having a blast so palpable, so unrelenting, it actually feels like a game-changer.',\n",
              "  'Taylor Wimpey: housing demand still strong after Brexit vote The UK housing market has remained buoyant since the vote for Brexit as potential buyers have continued to snap up new homes, according to Taylor Wimpey. In a trading update, Britainâ€™s third-biggest housebuilder said sales and cancellations since the 23 June referendum had barely changed from a year ago and that customers were confident. It said the effect of the vote was not yet clear but that the marketâ€™s long-term health was underpinned by strong demand. Like other housebuilders, Taylor Wimpey noticed a brief faltering of demand straight after the Brexit vote followed by business picking up to normal levels. Before the referendum, remain campaigners warned of a housing shock if there was a vote to leave and some analysts have said a crash remains likely. Prices in some parts of central London have fallen and sales of â€œsuper primeâ€\\x9d homes costing Â£10m or more have plunged but Taylor Wimpey said the mainstream market was holding up. In Londonâ€™s zones one and two, prices have fallen slightly for the highest priced homes but demand remains strong, it said. Pete Redfern, Taylor Wimpeyâ€™s chief executive, said: â€œTrading during the second half of 2016 and into the autumn selling season has been strong. While there remains some uncertainty following the UKâ€™s vote to leave the EU, we are encouraged to see that the housing market has remained robust and trading has remained resilient.â€\\x9d Taylor Wimpey said after almost 11 months of its financial year it had sold 0.75 properties a week at each of its developments compared with 0.76 for the same period last year. Cancellation rates stand at 13%, up slightly from 11% a year earlier. The companyâ€™s shares rose 3% to 150p. The shares plunged by more than a third to as low as 116p soon after the referendum as investors feared the vote would knock confidence in the property market. The company said it was sticking to its plan to pay Â£450m in dividends next year.',\n",
              "  'Burpy, baldy, deafy â€¦ auctioned artwork reveals rejected Snow White dwarves A display of concept drawings by the seminal movie artist Albert Hurter have shed new light on some of the rejected characters who didnâ€™t make the cut in Walt Disneyâ€™s 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The final lineup â€“ Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy and Dopey â€“ was selected from a pool of around 50 brainstormed by his team; in the Grimmsâ€™ original 1812 story, the dwarves are anonymous. Although many of the ultimately rejected names â€“ including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty and Burpy â€“ were already known, the artwork reveals how close some of them came to actual animation. The drawings were sold as part of an auction of 400 pieces at Bonhams in New York that raised a total of Â£500,000. A sketch of Deafy shows a tunic-clad chap cupping his ear and leaning unhappily towards the noise. Baldy, meanwhile, appears to be attempting to conceal his lack of hair with a huge hood, while also distracting the attention with an impressive tum and some unfortunate tights. Dr Catherine Williamson, director of entertainment memorabilia at Bonhams, said: â€œI think the guys at Disney will be relieved that the names of the dwarfs were changed at the last minute. â€œIâ€™m sure they wouldnâ€™t have offended sensibilities back in the 1930s but it would be a different story today. The original ones arenâ€™t as good as what they eventually came up with. â€œThe great thing about the names they used is that theyâ€™re not just physical references, theyâ€™re emotional. Itâ€™s good that they made it more about personality than physicality.â€\\x9d The film is widely regarded as one of Disneyâ€™s finest. Its success turned around the studioâ€™s fortunes, and its legacy is still apparent in cinema today. A live-action revisionist spinoff, told from the point of view of Snow Whiteâ€™s sister, Red Rose, was announced by the studio earlier this year.',\n",
              "  'White evangelicals are playing the long game. This is the result they wanted Donald Trumpâ€™s victory over Hillary Clinton wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the support of white evangelical voters. For nearly four decades, white evangelicals have been a mainstay of the Republican party, and thatâ€™s no small matter. By some estimates, one in four voters fit that demographic, meaning that white evangelicals constitute one of the GOPâ€™s most reliable voting blocs. This election was no exception to the rule. Exit polls suggest that four out of five white evangelicals turned out as usual and cast their lot with Trump. What seems different this time, however, is the candidate for whom they voted. Since Jerry Falwell Sr founded the â€œmoral majorityâ€\\x9d in 1979, white evangelicalism has sought to position itself as the moral voice of the nation. For the most part, that has translated into unwavering support for socially conservative politicians and policies, undergirded by a strong sense of individual piety. Hence the designation of white evangelicals as â€œvalues votersâ€\\x9d. Trump, by most accounts, deviates sharply from this norm. As The Atlanticâ€™s Jonathan Merritt has succinctly put it, â€œDonald Trump is immodest, arrogant, foul-mouthed, money-obsessed, thrice-married, and until recently, pro-choice,â€\\x9d all of which flies in the face of professed evangelical standards. Combined with his often-overt misogyny, racism, and xenophobia, Trump seems more than a far cry from the Jesus whom evangelicals claim to love and preach. Throughout his campaign and now after, the apparent contradiction between Trump and so-called evangelical values has been the focus of much of the commentariat. Some prominent evangelicals to their credit sought all along to raise the red flag, urging their flock to think twice about lining up behind Trump. Less sympathetic observers have understandably charged white evangelicals with blatant partisan hypocrisy. Such criticisms make some sense, but they donâ€™t take us very far in understanding white evangelicalism as a social and political phenomenon. Evangelicals may very well consider themselves â€œvalues votersâ€\\x9d, but the emphasis has never really been on the perceived moral uprightness or religious bona fides of the candidate in question. Itâ€™s always nice when the two appear to line up, but the heart of contemporary white evangelicalism lies in advocating for a specific, right-leaning set of social policies. More important than individual proclivities is stemming the tide of what they see as widespread cultural decay. Trumpâ€™s nostalgia-laden promise to â€œMake America great againâ€\\x9d hit the right note in this respect. For many white evangelicals, a great America is a Christian America, and a Christian America is one whose laws are socially conservative and geared towards evangelical identity. Traditionally, much of the focus has been on anti-abortion politics and issues related to so-called family values and religious freedom, and Trump sounded all the right notes here. He also smartly solidified himself as a friend to evangelicals by choosing Mike Pence, a socially conservative, evangelical Catholic, as his running mate. Trumpâ€™s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, racially charged rhetoric played right into the hands of white evangelicals as well. Although white evangelicals may often express a desire to love their neighbours as themselves, in reality the commandment is selectively applied. Anyone considered and deemed a threat to evangelical self-understanding, which includes a narrow vision of what America looks like, is on the other side of the fabled â€œculture warâ€\\x9d. At the end of the day, that war is based in a particular conception of whiteness, filtered through the lens of religious identity and social conservatism. Itâ€™s not surprising, then, that four out of five latched on. Iâ€™m sure most white evangelicals would balk at the charge of racial politics, but the overall motivation in backing Trump has never been much of a secret. Itâ€™s safe to say that for many evangelicals, Trump never represented any sort of ideal, and most werenâ€™t under any illusion about the direction of his moral compass. But for white evangelicals, God works even through the imperfect, and Godâ€™s work must â€“ and will â€“ be done. The â€œworkâ€\\x9d involved this time around is as old as the moral majority: itâ€™s about protecting some modicum of evangelical identity and social values against a perceived onslaught of antagonistic liberalism. More specifically in regard to this election, white evangelical support for Trump was and is all about appointing conservative, evangelical-friendly judges to the supreme court. Itâ€™s also about enacting laws that they hope will put a stop to what they consider as threats to religious freedom, even if the latter border on discrimination. White evangelicals, in other words, are playing the long game, and that has nothing to do with who Trump is as an individual. That may all sound hypocritical, but thatâ€™s just what white evangelicalism is in the US. Although laden with the rhetoric of personal piety, it is primarily a social and political phenomenon, and we would do well to view it in such terms. As this election has made clear, white evangelicals will also stop at nothing in their attempt to establish their version of a â€œChristian Americaâ€\\x9d. That includes supporting someone like Trump, who told them exactly what they wanted to hear. It was a match made in heaven.',\n",
              "  'Mike Hart obituary The singer-songwriter Mike Hart, who has died aged 72, sang with the Liverpool band the Roadrunners, and was a member of the poetry and music collective Liverpool Scene, but he will be best remembered for his solo album Mike Hart Bleeds. Released by John Peelâ€™s Dandelion label in 1969, it was an eccentric, defiant record by someone who was prepared to argue his corner. The song Aberfan berates celebrities for crying publicly at the tragedy in the Welsh mining village; Shelter Song criticises the church for not housing the homeless in its huge cathedrals; and Almost Liverpool 8 is a diatribe at the latest girl to leave in his extensive list of doomed relationships. Hartâ€™s album was the antithesis of easy listening and his career was equally edgy: there can be few artists who have so consistently sabotaged their own success. Hart was born in Bebington, on the Wirral, son of Colin Hart, who ran a sailmakersâ€™ business, William Hart & Co, and his wife, Beryl, and educated at Birkenhead school. In 1962 he formed the Roadrunners, a rhythm and blues band, which had residencies in Liverpool at Hope Hall (now the Everyman theatre) and the Cavern. Roger McGough claimed the group could perform Twist and Shout and Money better than the Beatles, and remembered Hart â€“ â€œArtyâ€\\x9d â€“ as â€œthe wild man in front â€¦ [who] was very popular with the ladies. He was weird-looking but he was very charismatic, a Jaggeresque thing.â€\\x9d In 1963, George Harrison told some Liverpool musicians that he had seen the Rolling Stones â€œwho are almost as good as the Roadrunnersâ€\\x9d. Their tour de force was Cry, Cry, Cry, which Hart would perform passionately, his eyes tight shut as if reliving some past ordeal. Hart turned down management from Giorgio Gomelsky and also a recording contract with Fontana. If Hart said no, that was it. There is subsequently little of the Roadrunners on tape, save for a live set from the Star-Club in Hamburg and a fundraising EP in 1965 for Liverpool University rag week. After travelling with the band to York, Hart refused to play and said it was over. He then joined Liverpool Scene alongside the poet Adrian Henri, and the musicians Andy Roberts, Mike Evans, Percy Jones and Brian Dodson. Their first single was Hartâ€™s witty, rasping song Son, Son (1968), in which everyone is too preoccupied to answer a childâ€™s questions. â€œIt was exposure to the poets that changed him and he found out how to express himself,â€\\x9d said Roberts, â€œbut he wouldnâ€™t tolerate things going wrong. He would throw his guitar against the wall if he had a bad gig.â€\\x9d The key track of the bandâ€™s 1968 album The Amazing Adventures of the Liverpool Scene was Hartâ€™s bitter-sweet Gliders and Parks, where he hopes a girl will turn up for a date in Coronation Park in Crosby. Unexpectedly, she arrives and the track is over, a rare Hart song with a positive ending, although a drunken row is not far away. The song opens with the words, â€œSaturday, got a Ribble busâ€\\x9d, an example of how Hart chronicled daily life, a theme later taken up by Morrissey and Billy Bragg. Liverpool Scene were bohemians, but they recognised that some discipline had to prevail and Hart was too wayward to last beyond the first album. He returned to Liverpool and formed a duo for a while with the 17-year old Jude Kelly, now artistic director of the Southbank Centre. Another girl, this time from Belgium, appears on the cover of Mike Hart Bleeds. To create the image, Hart dripped his blood on her photograph and stubbed his cigarette out on his face, writing the liner note as if he were in an asylum. She is probably the subject of the track Artyâ€™s Wife. â€œIt is a brilliant title with a brilliant cover,â€\\x9d said McGough, â€œand I loved his heart-wrenching voice, but he lacked confidence and he would back away from opportunities. He couldnâ€™t believe that people admired him. He didnâ€™t trust that and maybe that is where the pain and the soul came from.â€\\x9d Although many thought of Hart as the Liverpool Dylan, the album was too raw to find a large audience. Hart moved to Edinburgh in 1971 and worked with actors around the fringe festival. This led to a second Dandelion album, Basher, Chalky, Pongo and Me (1972), which combined jokes and sketches with his strident songs, including one about a brief affair with the playwright Nell Dunn. His later songs were either unrecorded or exist in cheaply made demo recordings. Hartâ€™s health deteriorated with constant drinking and he lost his memory. He spent his later years in a nursing home in Edinburgh. He is survived by a sister, Susan, two nephews and a niece. â€¢ Michael William Hart, singer and songwriter, born 3 December 1943; died 22 June 2016',\n",

Grant will play Phoenix Buchanan, a celebrity who lives on the same road as the eponymous bear and his adoptive family, the Browns. Buchanan is described by the production company as â€œa vain, charming acting legend whose star has fallen somewhat in recent yearsâ€\\x9d. Gleeson will join the cast as safecracker Knuckles McGinty, while Ben Whishaw, Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters, Peter Capaldi and Jim Broadbent all return. The plot of the new film concerns Paddingtonâ€™s attempt to buy a book as a present for his aunt Lucyâ€™s 100th birthday, only for the book to be stolen. Director Paul King welcomed Grant and Gleeson to the cast. â€œIt has been a complete joy to return to the world of Paddington,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIt was such a delight to see his first big-screen adventure embraced by audiences around the world, and I couldnâ€™t be more excited about Hugh and Brendan joining the cast to bring his next outing to life.â€\\x9d The first Paddington film was a commercial and critical success, with a global box office of $289m, making it the highest-grossing non-studio family film ever.

              "  'RNC communications head Sean Spicer to become White House press secretary Donald Trump has picked his presidential press team, naming Sean Spicer, chief strategist and communications director of the Republican National Committee, as his White House press secretary. Trump named other loyalists for top communications posts: Hope Hicks (director of strategic communications), Jason Miller (director of communications) and Dan Scavino (director of social media). â€œSean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition,â€\\x9d the president-elect said in a statement. â€œI am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again.â€\\x9d Spicer worked closely with the RNC chair, Reince Priebus, in an election marked by bitter intra-party opposition to Trump. Both men have been rewarded for such loyalty: Priebus will serve as White House chief of staff. Using Twitter, Spicer said the appointment was an â€œamazing honorâ€\\x9d. Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondentsâ€™ Association, congratulated the appointees and said in a statement: â€œWe look forward to working with all of them in the months ahead.â€\\x9d During the campaign, Trump made a point of criticising the press for supposed bias against him, often picking out individual reporters by name and directing crowds at his rallies to boo them. Perhaps consequently, his political team has not been particularly open with the media. The president-elect has not held a press conference since July, preferring recently to stage campaign-style events in states that voted for him. Earlier on Thursday, Trump announced that his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, would serve in the White House as counselor to the president. Conway told ABCâ€™S Good Morning America: â€œThis will be a traditional White House in the sense that you will have a great deal of press availability on a daily basis and youâ€™ll have a president who continues to be engaged with the press.â€\\x9d Last weekend, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump hosted an off-the-record gathering for journalists. On Monday, the Washington Post published a summary of Jason Millerâ€™s daily transition teleconferences with journalists and his inability to provide answers, given his bossâ€™s predilection for communicating via Twitter instead. One question in a briefing last week, the paper wrote, concerned Trumpâ€™s dispute with the CIA over Russiaâ€™s hacking of the presidential election. Miller, the Post wrote, answered: â€œIâ€™d let the president-electâ€™s tweets speak for themselves.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Trump implies 'second amendment folks' could stop Clinton judge picks â€“ as it happened Final item from us tonight. Hillary Clinton paid a visit earlier to a health clinic in Miami, the epicenter of the Zika outbreak in the US, and appealed to Republican leaders to convene an emergency session of Congress to pass funding to combat the mosquito-borne virus, reports Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington. The Democratic nominee used the bully pulpit of the presidential campaign to voice her frustration with lawmakers in Washington, who left town last month for a summer recess without meeting the federal governmentâ€™s request for funds to fight the spread of the Zika virus. â€œI am very disappointed that the Congress went on recess before actually agreeing on what they would do to put the resources into this fight,â€\\x9d Clinton said. â€œAnd I really am hoping that they will pay attention.â€\\x9d Clinton delivered her remarks following a tour of the Borinquen Health Care Center, a community clinic in Miamiâ€™s Wynwood neighborhood, which has borne the brunt of Floridaâ€™s Zika outbreak. The state of Florida, a key battleground in Novemberâ€™s presidential race, has been the most severely hit by the virus, which poses the greatest threat to pregnant women due to its cause of birth defects such as microcephaly. Clinton said she first learned of Zika in December through her daughter Chelsea, who was pregnant at the time with her second child. â€œWe donâ€™t want to wake up in a year and read so many more stories about babies like the little girl who just died in Houston,â€\\x9d Clinton said, citing a fatal case of Zika-related microcephaly reported out of Texas on Tuesday. â€œThat is just not something we should tolerate in our country.â€\\x9d The Obama administration requested a $1.9bn spending package several months ago, basing its figure on the needs of public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The request quickly devolved into partisan politics on Capitol Hill, as House Republicans instead passed a measure that included riders to overturn certain clean water regulations, restricted money for Planned Parenthood and undermined the health care law. Senate Democrats twice filibustered the House-passed proposal, which Barack Obama has also said he would veto. Republicans have in turn accused Democrats of blocking the necessary funding and on Tuesday took aim at Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator and Clintonâ€™s vice presidential running mate, for voting against their Zika bill. Clinton urged lawmakers to put aside politics and advance a separate bipartisan agreement that cleared the Senate in June and would allocate $1.1bn in funding with no strings attached. She also took aim at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has ignored the Zika virus all together and told a local television station in Florida he did not need to opine on the issue because the stateâ€™s governor, Rick Scott, had it â€œunder controlâ€\\x9d. â€œI disagree with those who say that Zika is an insignificant issue,â€\\x9d Clinton said. â€œThis is something we need to take seriously.â€\\x9d Contrary to Trumpâ€™s claims, Scott, a Republican who has endorsed the nominee, has sounded repeated alarms over the Zika outbreak. He, too, implored US lawmakers to return to Washington and address the funding gap. â€œThe federal government must stop playing politics and Congress needs to immediately come back to session to resolve this,â€\\x9d Scott said on Tuesday, as Floridaâ€™s health department identified four more individuals who likely contracted Zika through a mosquito bite. Salman Rushdie, himself no stranger to threats of assassination, has delivered his verdict on the nature of Donald Trumpâ€™s remarks: US Secret Service, on Donald Trumpâ€™s comments: The Secret Service is aware of the comment. The NRA might have changed the channel a little early. Donald Trumpâ€™s campaignâ€™s initial clarification of his remarks in Wilmington, North Carolina, today was to blame the â€œdishonest mediaâ€\\x9d for quoting Trump as saying that the use of firearms could be considered a logical recourse in the event of Hillary Clintonâ€™s selection of supreme court justices. So, in the interest of providing as much information as possible to American readers and voters, here are Trumpâ€™s full comments regarding the Second Amendment today: Hillary wants to abolish, essentially, the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day. If Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now weâ€™re tied. You see whatâ€™s going on. Weâ€™re tied â€˜cause Scalia, this was not supposed to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years, at least, and this is what happened. That was a horrible thing, So now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the second amendment. Now speaking to the NRA folks, who are great: when you, when you, and I tell you, so they endorsed me. They endorsed me very early. My sons are members. Iâ€™m a member. If you, we can add, I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the justices, they almost go, in a certain way, hand and hand. Now the justices are going to do things that are so important. And we have such great justices. You saw my list of eleven that have been vetted and respected and have gotten great, and they, a little bit, equate. But if you donâ€™t do whatâ€™s the right thing, youâ€™re not going to have - either youâ€™re not going to have a Second Amendment or youâ€™re not going to have much of it left. And youâ€™re not going to be able to protect yourselves, which you need. Which you need! When the bad guys burst into your hours, theyâ€™re not looking about Second Amendments and â€˜do I have the right to do this.â€™ The bad guys arenâ€™t going to be giving up their weapons. But the good people will say, â€˜oh, well, thatâ€™s the law.â€™ No, no. Not going to happen. We canâ€™t let it happen. We canâ€™t let it happen. Video: Donald Trump implying that the use of firearms might be adequate response to Hillary Clintonâ€™s selection of supreme court justices. Roger Stone, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign, implied last month to internet agitator Milo Yiannopoulos that the notion of discrediting the election as â€œillegitimateâ€\\x9d is part of Trumpâ€™s campaign strategy. â€œI think we have widespread voter fraud, but the first thing that Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly,â€\\x9d Stone said. â€œHe needs to say for example, today would be a perfect example: â€˜I am leading in Florida. The polls all show it. If I lose Florida, we will know that thereâ€™s voter fraud. If thereâ€™s voter fraud, this election will be illegitimate, the election of the winner will be illegitimate, we will have a constitutional crisis, widespread civil disobedience, and the government will no longer be the government.â€™â€\\x9d â€œIf you canâ€™t have an honest election, nothing else counts,â€\\x9d Stone continued. â€œI think heâ€™s gotta put them on notice that their inauguration will be a rhetorical, and when I mean civil disobedience, not violence, but it will be a bloodbath. The government will be shut down if they attempt to steal this and swear Hillary in. No, we will not stand for it. We will not stand for it.â€\\x9d Ex-CIA director Michael Hayden, on Trumpâ€™s comment: If someone said that outside hall, theyâ€™d be in a police wagon being questioned by Secret Service. Note: Threatening to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm on a presidential candidate is a felony, punishable with up to five years in prison. The last time that a major candidate joked - or appeared to offhandedly suggest - that their opponent be assassinated, it helped result in their resounding defeat. In 2010, Nevada senate candidate Sharron Angle said in a radio interview that the Second Amendmentâ€™s right to bear arms could be construed to encourage firearm-bearing Americans to throw off the shackles of elected officials, including her then-opponent, senate minority leader Harry Reid. â€œI feel that the Second Amendment is the right to keep and bear arms for our citizenry,â€\\x9d Angle said at the time. â€œThis not for someone whoâ€™s in the military. This not for law enforcement. This is for us. And in fact when you read that Constitution and the founding fathers, they intended this to stop tyranny. This is for us when our government becomes tyrannical.â€\\x9d â€œItâ€™s to defend ourselves. And you know, Iâ€™m hoping that weâ€™re not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems.â€\\x9d Members of Congress are already responding to Donald Trumpâ€™s comments, reading them as a call for Hillary Clintonâ€™s assassination or that of her would-be supreme court nominee: In comment provided to the , Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called Trumpâ€™s suggestion that firearms be used in response to Hillary Clintonâ€™s nomination of supreme court judges â€œdangerous.â€\\x9d This is simple - what Trump is saying is dangerous. A person seeking to the be President of the United States should not suggest violence in any way. Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign has responded to accusations that the candidate implied that the use of firearms might be an appropriate response to Hillary Clintonâ€™s election to the presidency and nomination of supreme court judges, blasting â€œdishonest mediaâ€\\x9d for quoting Trump. â€œItâ€™s called the power of unification â€“ 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power,â€\\x9d Jason Miller, the campaignâ€™s senior communications adviser, said in a statement. â€œAnd this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it wonâ€™t be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump.â€\\x9d The â€™s David Smith has more on Rudy Giulianiâ€™s introduction of Donald Trump in Wilmington, North Carolina, in which he implied that Hillary Clinton should face a similar punishment to a man who was executed by Iran for spying. Trump was introduced by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who brought up the case of Shahram Amiri, an Iranian nuclear scientist executed for spying for the US. Clinton received emails mentioning him on her controversial personal server when she was secretary of state. Giuliani said: â€œRemember Hillary told us there was no top secret information on her emails? Remember she told us that. Well, she lied! And I donâ€™t know the connection between that and the death of Mr Amiri, but what I do know is it put a lot more attention on him when they found those emails. It certainly put him at great risk, even if they didnâ€™t find them, and it shows you that when the director of the FBI said she was extremely careless, he was being kind.â€\\x9d But Giuliani repeatedly waved away chants of â€œLock her up!â€\\x9d from the crowd. Priorities Action USA, a Super-Pac that supports Democratic candidates, has issued a succinct statement in response to Donald Trumpâ€™s apparent implication that firearms might be used in response to Hillary Clintonâ€™s selection of supreme court justices in an email titled â€œDonald Trump Just Suggested That Someone Shoot Hillary Clintonâ€\\x9d: THIS IS NOT OK. The apparent implication that the use or ownership of firearms would be a potential recourse for Hillary Clintonâ€™s selection of supreme court justices from Donald Trump this afternoon is not the first time that such a suggestion has come out of the Trump campaign. Trumpâ€™s adviser on veterans issues, Al Baldasaro, called for Clintonâ€™s execution by firing squad in a radio interview last month. â€œThis whole thing disgusts me, Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason,â€\\x9d Baldasaro said, calling Clinton a â€œpiece of garbage.â€\\x9d Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said that Trumpâ€™s campaign was â€œincredibly grateful for [Baldasaroâ€™s] support, but we donâ€™t agree with his comments.â€\\x9d Baldasaro was later investigated by the US Secret Service for the comments. The has reached out to the US Secret Service regarding Trumpâ€™s comments today. Speaking at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appeared to suggest the use of firearms as a solution to rival Hillary Clinton choosing federal judges in the event of her election. â€œHillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the second amendment, and by the way, and if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno,â€\\x9d Trump said. The audience cheered and whistled. â€œBut Iâ€™ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day,â€\\x9d Trump continued. â€œIf Hillary gets to put her judges... right now, weâ€™re tied - you see whatâ€™s going on. Weâ€™re tied, â€™cause, Scalia, this was not supposed to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years, at least, and this is what happens. That was a horrible thing.â€\\x9d The has reached out to the Trump campaign for clarification of the comment. Appearing at a campaign rally in North Carolina, Donald Trump lashed out at Hillary Clinton as Isisâ€™ â€œmost-valuable player,â€\\x9d and forewarned that voter fraud will rob him of victory in the general election if his followers are not vigilant. â€œIf Iâ€™m Isis, I call her up and give her the Most Valuable Player award,â€\\x9d Trump said of his general election opponent, further saying that the late general George Patton is â€œspinning in his graveâ€\\x9d over American military operations fighting Isis. He then elaborated on a frequent theme from his recent rallies, declaring that his possible loss in the general election would be the result of voter fraud. â€œVoter ID, whatâ€™s with that? Whatâ€™s with voter ID? Why arenâ€™t we having voter ID?â€\\x9d Trump asked the crowd. â€œIn other words, I wanna vote. Hereâ€™s my identification. I wanna vote. As opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary. Well, and I will not tell you to vote 15 times. I will not tell you to do that, okay? You wonâ€™t vote 15 times, but people will. Theyâ€™ll vote many times. And how that could have happened is unbelievable and the governor just told me that theyâ€™re going before the United States supreme court. Justice Roberts. And maybe they can get a stay. letâ€™s see what happens, okay? Letâ€™s see what happens. Thatâ€™s a very important thing.â€\\x9d Russell Simmons, the American entrepreneur and founder of Def Jam Records, said his one-time friend Donald Trump has â€œfueled a lot of hateâ€\\x9d in the pursuit of the presidency. Appearing on the inaugural episode of Politics for Humans, a podcast hosted by US political reporter Sabrina Siddiqui, Simmons recalled taking Trump to a mosque in New York City years before he sought the Republican nomination for president. Back then, Trump, who as the Republican nominee has proposed banning all Muslim immigration to the US, was more amenable to meeting with Muslim leaders. â€œHe was very kind and that was the end of it,â€\\x9d Simmons said. â€œBut years later this fire has come up. Heâ€™s fueled a lot of hate and a lot of people are ignorant, and heâ€™s helped to promote that ignorance.â€\\x9d Simmons said he was once good friends with Trump - they traveled together to Trumpâ€™s Florida resort Mar-A-Lago each weekend, and Simmons even recalled being present for the real estate mogulâ€™s first date with his wife Melania Trump. But the Trump he now sees on the campaign trail is someone he no longer recognizes. â€œItâ€™s scary, you donâ€™t want him to be president for Godâ€™s sake,â€\\x9d Simmons said, adding that Trump was â€œa grudge carrierâ€\\x9d and the two no longer speak. â€œHe donâ€™t talk to me after I said Iâ€™d rather Kim Kardashian be president.â€\\x9d In the podcast, which examines the Black Lives Matter movement, Simmons also reflected on his experience as a black male and encounters with law enforcement. â€œAs a young person, I was always afraid of the police, and I have had experiences of being mistreated and yelled at and talked down to,â€\\x9d Simmons said. Listen to the podcast here: Watch it live here: After being challenged by opponent Hillary Clinton to accept the terms of three upcoming presidential debates after quibbling on the schedule, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told Time in an interview that he will commit to the debates - but some of the terms might be â€œrenegotiated.â€\\x9d â€œI will absolutely do three debates,â€\\x9d Trump said. â€œI want to debate very badly. But I have to see the conditions.â€\\x9d The nonpartisan organization in charge of general-election debates, the Commission on Presidential Debates, selected the dates, format and venues of the three presidential debates and single vice-presidential debate in September of last year - but that hasnâ€™t kept Trump from insisting that the schedule was â€œriggedâ€\\x9d by Clintonâ€™s team. â€œI renegotiated the debates in the primaries, remember?â€\\x9d Trump said, of the primary debates, one of which he elected not to appear on. â€œThey were making a fortune on them and they had us in for three and a half hours and I said thatâ€™s ridiculous. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll be open to any suggestions I have, because I think theyâ€™ll be very fair suggestions. But I havenâ€™t [seen the conditions] yet. Theyâ€™re actually presented to me tonight.â€\\x9d Trump also declared that he is willing to veto the selection of moderators, which have not been announced. â€œIâ€™ll have to see who the moderators are,â€\\x9d Trump said. â€œYeah, I would say that certain moderators would be unacceptable, absolutely. I did very well in the debates on the primaries. According to the polls, I won all of them. So I look forward to the debates. But, yeah, I want to have fair moderators â€¦ I will demand fair moderators.â€\\x9d Last night, Clintonâ€™s campaign released a statement urging Trump to commit to the debates, calling it â€œconcerning that the Trump campaign is already engaged in shenanigans around these debates.â€\\x9d The three debates are scheduled for 26 September in Hempstead, New York; 9 October in St. Louis; and 19 October in Las Vegas. The lone vice-presidential debate will be held on 4 October in Farmville, Virginia. In a damning editorial published in the Los Angeles Times, a former Minuteman III nuclear launch officer wrote that Donald Trump â€œcannot be trustedâ€\\x9d to responsibly wield Americaâ€™s nuclear arsenal. The op-ed, titled â€œI was a Minuteman III nuclear launch officer. Take it from me: We canâ€™t let Trump become president,â€\\x9d was penned by John Noonan, who worked more than 300 nuclear â€œalerts,â€\\x9d 24-hour shifts in which he was entrusted with the execution of US nuclear protocols if so ordered by the president. Noonan â€œspent five years of my life as a Minuteman III launch officer,â€\\x9d and an additional year as an instructor. In the piece, Noonan expressed horror at Trumpâ€™s apparent fascination with nuclear weapons, and his lack of familiarity with the concept of deterrence as a strategy. â€œIt gives me no pleasure to say this, but I believe my partyâ€™s nominee for president is mentally unfit to assume this heavy responsibility,â€\\x9d Noonan, a longtime Republican, wrote. â€œTrump cannot be trusted with weapons that can kill millions ... These duties are simply too grave to entrust to a man who has exhibited sociopathic and chronically narcissistic behavior throughout his checkered career.â€\\x9d Citing the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails that revealed bias against his presidential campaign among senior members of the party, Vermont senator and former Democrat Bernie Sanders is using his considerable fundraising apparatus to kick Debbie Wasserman Schultz out of Congress. â€œThis race is very important for Our Revolution because if we can win this tough fight in Florida, it will send a clear message about the power of our grassroots movement that will send shockwaves through the political and media establishments,â€\\x9d Sanders penned in an email to his followers. â€œThe recent emails leaked from Democratic Party staff showed that under Debbie Wasserman Schultz, DNC staff were not exactly fair and even-minded during the presidential primary,â€\\x9d Sanders continued. â€œWhat was revealed wasnâ€™t much of a shock to us, because we knew all along that the establishment wasnâ€™t on our side.â€\\x9d After her resignation as chair of the DNC, however, Sanders wrote that â€œwe have the opportunity to transform the Democratic Party and open up its doors to working people and young people - people who want real change.â€\\x9d With a DayGlo-orange face and his trademark floppy hair, Donald Trump stands gleefully holding an inflatable globe. He has the whole world in his hands and he is thrilled. This scene, while possibly not far from reality, is drawn from one of the most topical satirical shows at this yearâ€™s Edinburgh fringe. Trumpageddon invites its audience to an intimate political rally where they can fire questions at the Republican nominee, play golf with him and even help him decide on policy â€“ which country he would invade first, for example. The show is the creation of satirist Simon Jay, who is the only person taking on the persona of Trump at the fringe. Jay, who first landed on the idea of creating a caricature of the billionaire businessman in January, said he never anticipated that the show would be quite so topical by August. Walking through the streets of Edinburgh dressed as Trump, he said he regularly has groups of US tourists shout: â€œWeâ€™re not voting for you,â€\\x9d at him. â€œThis is so out of my comfort zone,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIâ€™m the antithesis of him, really â€“ a gay, liberal, English socialist who usually prefers playing women. And here I am playing an alpha male with racist and misogynistic views.â€\\x9d With so many US tourists visiting Edinburgh for the festival, Jay said he hopes his satire will be a release valve. At the end of every show, he asks for a show of hands from those who intend to vote for him; he has yet to have a Trump fan reveal themselves. He said: â€œThe show features so many of the ludicrous things he has said and presented as fact â€“ that Isis wants to take over the Vatican, or calling Hillary Clinton the devil. And when I repeat those things, Iâ€™ve had Americans in the audience who shake their heads and look pained, as if they are saying: â€œHelp me.â€\\x9d People are terrified, and rightly so.â€\\x9d Scenes from a Trump rally: Public Policy Pollingâ€™s latest numbers out of North Carolina show good signs for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s chances in the state - and not-so-good signs of post-election bipartisanship. According to the survey, released this morning, Clinton leading in North Carolina for the first time since March, 43% to Donald Trumpâ€™s 41%, with 7% of voters saying they plan to support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 2% expressing support for Green candidate Jill Stein. In a head-to-head contest, Clintonâ€™s lead shrinks to a single point over Trump, 47% to 46%. But Trumpâ€™s insistence that the election may be â€œriggedâ€\\x9d in Clintonâ€™s favor appears to have found fertile ground in North Carolina Republicans. The survey found that 69% of Trump supporters believe that if Clinton wins the election, it will have been due to voter fraud, compared to only 16% who think that it would mean that she received more support than Trump. A full 40% of Trump voters think that Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, will steal the election for Clinton, despite the organizationâ€™s notable handicap of not existing since 2010. PPP also asked a few more troll-y questions, resulting in statistics that show that 41% of Trump voters in North Carolina say that they think Clinton is the devil, 47% of his voters say they saw a nonexistent video of Iran collecting $400m from the United States and only 38% of voters think Trump can be trusted with nuclear weapons. The rise of Trump has led, perversely, to the revival of Obama. Republican candidates are saying they will not vote for their presidential nominee, and the partyâ€™s national security officials are lining up to condemn Trump as a reckless danger to the Republic. How could the incumbent not look like a statesman compared to a man who apparently canâ€™t be trusted with the elevator button, never mind a nuclear one? Inside the White House, Obamaâ€™s aides talk about a president liberated from previous constraint. On the trail, and at the podium, he seems to love campaigning against his orange nemesis. His partyâ€™s candidates canâ€™t get enough of him, and his potential successor â€“ instead of putting distance between them â€“ believes Obama doesnâ€™t get enough credit for his economic achievements. This one-term president is having an unusually successful end to his second term, and for that he can thank the Republicans who were so determined to destroy him. The father of the man who killed 49 people in a gay Orlando nightclub in June has endorsed Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential bid, appearing behind Clinton at a rally in Kissimmee, Florida, last night. â€œHillary Clinton is good for United States versus Donald Trump, who has no solutions,â€\\x9d Seddique Mateen, father of the deceased shooter Omar Mateen, told WPTV. Of his attendance at the rally, Mateen said: â€œItâ€™s a Democratic party, so everyone can join.â€\\x9d The Clinton campaign has issued a short statement stating that Mateen was not invited to the Kissimmee event, despite his proximity to the candidate. â€œThe rally was a 3,000-person, open-door event for the public,â€\\x9d the campaign said. â€œThis individual wasnâ€™t invited as a guest and the campaign was unaware of his attendance until after the event.â€\\x9d Clinton began the rally in Kissimmee by paying tribute to those killed in the Pulse nightclub shooting in June. â€œI know how many people, families, loved ones and friends are still grieving, and we will be with you as you rebuild your lives,â€\\x9d Clinton said. Donald Trumpâ€™s sharpest critic: Donald Trump. When Donald Trump visited Detroit on Monday to unveil his economic vision for the US, the Republican presidential nominee held the Rust Belt city up as a bastion of failed Democratic party policies, calling it a â€œliving, breathing example of my opponentâ€™s failed economic agendaâ€\\x9d. â€œDetroit is still waiting for Hillary Clintonâ€™s apology,â€\\x9d Trump said in a nearly hourlong speech before the business-friendly Detroit Economic Club. But in a town that has consistently voted for the Democrats, Trump will be hard-pressed to find support, warned residents and business owners. â€œIf he really knew, like, the politics of Detroit, for example, a lot of the failed policies were Republican, like the schools,â€\\x9d said Alyson Turner, of Source Booksellers, a nonfiction bookstore located outside of downtown Detroit. Turner said the appointment by Republican governor Rick Snyder of several emergency managers to take over operations of the Detroit public school system has led to disastrous effects. Teachers this year, for example, have staged large-scale protests in light of the possibility they might work without pay. Turnerâ€™s mother and Source owner, Janet Webster Jones, pointed to the expansion of US highways under President Eisenhower as another Republican policy with a major impact on the city. Among the litany of problems that led Detroit into fiscal uncertainty and, eventually, a massive municipal bankruptcy, the highway system in metro Detroit is viewed by researchers as having helped accelerate white flight â€“ in turn, decimating the cityâ€™s tax base. The highway act â€œtore up the city of Detroitâ€\\x9d, Jones said. Trump may have delivered his remarks before a welcoming crowd on Monday. But the candidate was interrupted by protesters more than a dozen times, a notable reminder of the multiple derailments along the way of his unconventional campaign. Hillary Clinton will seize on criticism of Donald Trumpâ€™s plan to repeal the so-called â€œdeath taxâ€\\x9d, which only benefits families with multi-million dollar estates like his own. Clinton will dismiss Trumpâ€™s proposal as further proof of the charge that he is only interested in policies that benefit himself, labeling it the â€œfriends and family discountâ€\\x9d, according to a Clinton campaign official. Trump, who has put himself forward as the champion of the American workers, laid out his economic agenda, which included a roster of proposals that align with Republican orthodoxy, including slashing tax rates,reducing the corporate tax rate and eliminating the so-called â€œdeath taxâ€\\x9d. Trump presented his pledge to repeal the estate tax, worth an estimated $25 billion a year, as a boon for the working class, but it only applies applies to estates larger than $5.45m for individuals, or $10.9m for married couples â€“ effectively, people like himself and his children. â€œAmerican workers have paid taxes their whole life, they shouldnâ€™t be taxed again when they die,â€\\x9dhe said Monday. Clinton will explain how this applies only to people in and around Trumpâ€™s tax bracket. If Trump is truly worth â€œin excess of ten billion dollarsâ€\\x9d as heâ€™s claimed, she will say, then he wold pay 40% for the estate tax, or approximately $3.996 billion when he passes his estate along to his heirs. Clinton will also make the case that itâ€™s â€œno coincidenceâ€\\x9d Trump is pushing tax reforms that largely benefit his own family. Clinton has said she will push for a tax system that ensures the wealthiest Americans and large corporations pay higher rates than middle class households. The families of two Americans killed in the 2012 terrorist attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, accusing the former secretary of state of â€œextreme carelessness in handling confidential and classified information,â€\\x9d which they say contributed to the death of their sons. Patricia Smith, mother of Foreign Service information management officer Sean Smith, and Charles Woods, father of Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, accuse the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate of making â€œfalse and defamatory statements negligently, recklessly, purposefully, and/or intentionally with actual malice â€¦ by stating that plaintiffs were lying about Clinton having told them that the Benghazi attack was caused by an anti-Muslim YouTube video.â€\\x9d The lawsuit, filed on Monday in the US District Court of DC, claims that â€œas a direct resultâ€\\x9d of Clintonâ€™s use of private email servers during her tenure as secretary of state, â€œIslamic terrorists were able to obtain the whereabouts of Ambassador Christopher Stevens ... and subsequently orchestrate, plan, and execute the now infamous September 11, 2012 attack.â€\\x9d Nick Merrill, the Clinton campaignâ€™s traveling press secretary, issued a statement in response, saying that â€œwhile no one can imagine the pain of the families of the brave Americans we lost at Benghazi, there have been nine different investigations into this attack and none found any evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing on the part of Hillary Clinton.â€\\x9d In the 2012 attack, Islamic militants attacked the American diplomatic compound in the port city of Benghazi, killing four Americans, including Smith and ambassador Chris Stevens. A second assault a few hours later targeted another compound, during which Woods was killed. The State Department was criticized in the aftermath of the attacks for not providing adequate security for the facilities, and for initially reporting that the attack was the outgrowth of a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim film made by an American preacher. Later investigations revealed that the attack was premeditated, and had been joined by rioters who were protesting the video. Smith and Woods have been vocally critical of Clinton as a presidential candidate, accusing her of fabricating the narrative that riots sparked the attack. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last month, Smith told the audience that she blamed â€œHillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.â€\\x9d The suit was filed by infamous Washington DC attorney Larry Klayman, a conservative former Justice Department prosecutor who filed 18 lawsuits of against the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Among other cases, Klayman has brought legal action against Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the National Security Agency, supreme court justice Elena Kagan and Barack Obama, whom he accused of secretly allowing the Ebola virus to enter the United States so it could be used against US citizens who are members of the â€œCaucasian race and Jewish-Christian religionâ€\\x9d. Good morning, and welcome to the â€™s campaign live blog, as we continue our minute-by-minute coverage from the US presidential campaign trail. Republican nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s address to the business-friendly Detroit Economic Club yesterday was intended to reset his campaign after a calamitous post-convention week, but Democratic rival Hillary Clinton doesnâ€™t appear ready to let him shift gears quite yet. Late last night, the former secretary of stateâ€™s campaign announced that she has preemptively accepted the Commission on Presidential Debatesâ€™ invitation to three presidential debates this fall â€“ in an apparent bid to force Trump, who has expressed concerns about the dates of the debates, to agree to meet with her. Campaign chair John Podesta said in a statement: Secretary Clinton looks forward to participating in all three presidential debates scheduled by the independent debate commission. It is concerning that the Trump campaign is already engaged in shenanigans around these debates. It is not clear if he is trying to avoid debates, or merely toying with the press to create more drama. Either way, our campaign is not interested in playing along with a debate about debates or bargaining around them.The only issue now is whether Donald Trump is going to show up to debate at the date, times, places and formats set by the commission last year through a bipartisan process. We will accept the commissionâ€™s invitation and expect Donald Trump to do the same. The dates for this yearâ€™s debates have been set since before Trump was a candidate, but that hasnâ€™t kept the Republican nominee from accusing Clinton of scheduling misbehavior. â€œWell, I tell you what I donâ€™t like. Itâ€™s against two NFL games,â€\\x9d Trump told ABCâ€™s This Week on 31 July of the debates. â€œI got a letter from the NFL saying this is ridiculous â€¦ because the NFL doesnâ€™t want to go against the debates because the debates are going to be pretty massive, from what I understand.â€\\x9d (The NFL, for what itâ€™s worth, says it did not send Trump any kind of letter.) The presidential debates were set some time ago by the Commission on Presidential Debates for Monday 26 September, Sunday 9 October, and Wednesday 19 October, with the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday 4 October. Weâ€™ve put in word to the Trump campaign inquiring whether their candidate plans to attend the debates. Weâ€™ll let you know what they say. Hereâ€™s todayâ€™s events schedule: Clinton will be in Miami, taking a tour of Borinquen Health Care Center, while running mate Tim Kaine will attend a volunteer appreciation event in Austin, Texas. Trump will be holding a rally at Trask Coliseum at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, in Wilmington, North Carolina at 2pm ET, followed by a 6pm ET rally at Crown Arena in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Running mate Mike Pence will be holding a town hall at Lancaster Host Resort and Conference Center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at 3pm ET and a â€œcelebrationâ€\\x9d (thatâ€™s the campaignâ€™s description) at Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh at 7pm ET.\",\n",
              "  \"MEPs to question man set to be UK's last EU commissioner The man likely to become Britainâ€™s last EU commissioner is due to be grilled by MEPs about his suitability for the job. Sir Julian King, a career civil servant currently serving as ambassador to France, is the British governmentâ€™s choice to become the UKâ€™s top official in Brussels. But first he must win the backing of MEPs on Monday evening, who will vote on whether to confirm him in the role of commissioner for â€œsecurity unionâ€\\x9d. King would take Britainâ€™s place around the table at the EU executiveâ€™s headquarters in Brussels following the departure of Jonathan Hill, who resigned as financial services chief following the Brexit vote. MEPs on the European parliamentâ€™s civil liberties committee will quiz King at a three-hour public hearing in Strasbourg. The committee, led by British Labour MEP Claude Moraes, will question King on the details of EU counter-terrorism strategy. The British commissioner-designate will almost inevitably face questions over Brexit, although at the commission his job would be to act in the common EU interest, not to speak for the British government. Some prominent MEPs had argued the UK should not get any portfolio in the commission following the Brexit vote. But MEPs may be reassured by the fact King will be a junior member of the commission. He will report to the commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, who will have the final say over any legislative initiatives. King will also not automatically attend ministerial meetings, usually a key part of a commissionerâ€™s job. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the commissioner in charge of home affairs and migration, will represent the commission on security policy at meetings with national ministers. King will have the opportunity at Mondayâ€™s hearing to make a 15-minute statement setting out his objectives before facing questions from all political groups in the committee.

              "  'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back review â€“ pecs, punchups and popcorn galore Tom Cruise is back in the role of Jack Reacher, badass military cop turned maverick civilian engaged in freelance pro bono asskicking. He is suffused with pimpernel mystery. At the end of an adventure, Reacher will stick his thumb out and hitchhike his way into the night. (At the end of Pulp Fiction, John Travolta is derisive about Samuel L Jacksonâ€™s ambition to â€œwalk the earthâ€\\x9d like Caine from the TV show Kung Fu on the grounds that he would just be a bum. But maybe he would be like Jack Reacher.) This is the second in Tom Cruiseâ€™s silly, entertaining Reacher franchise, and I was hoping he would marry a woman called Round and go for the double-barrelled surname. Instead, he monkishly refrains from sex but does pull a classic Cruise/Reacher move: semi-undressing in a motel room after a punchup, disclosing pecs which fall impressively on the right side of the moob borderline. An attractive woman also partially disrobes, flaunting a workaday bra strap. Another Reacher trope is the grumpy solo meal in the scuzzy cafe, which generally comes just before or after the biggest Reacher signature of all: beating the daylights out of five or six bullies whose sneery expressions and close-cropped goatees denote imminent victim status more clearly than red shirts on Star Trek crew. Cruise also gives us his some vintage sprinting â€” now as distinctive a trait as Nic Cageâ€™s sudden shouting â€” as well as a bit of free climbing and some Olympic-quality ledge dangling. The story opens as Reacher has rather sweetly fallen for Lt Susan Turner, just through talking to her on the phone. She is played by Cobie Smulders (who plays Agent Maria Hill in the Avengers films). But when Jack shows up in Washington DC for their blind date, he is informed that Lt Turner has been arrested for espionage. Clearly she is the victim of a shady cover-up from corrupt top brass, and Reacherâ€™s quietly furious demands to know whatâ€™s going on are undermined when the army claims he is the subject of a paternity case, and that he is the dad of a stroppy teen, Samantha (Danika Yarosh). Reacher is wrongly accused of murder by the crooked authorities, and in time-honoured style goes on the run, taking his quasi-spouse and daughter, while blowing the lid off a terrible conspiracy. The highlight of the first movie was its outrageous villain, played by Werner Herzog. I was hoping for a similar auteur bad guy in this one â€“ surely Paul Verhoeven would have been a good sport? Well, there is no juicy high-concept baddie this time around, but there is a lot of enjoyable hokum and cheerful ridiculousness, especially when Reacher has to spring someone from military prison using his trademark combo of resourcefulness and punching. Popcornily preposterous and watchable.',\n",
              "  'Human rights must be protected against the abuse of power The way we protect human rights is under sustained attack. Politicians and the press, hostile to Europe in all its forms, peddle lies and distortions about the European convention on human rights, the Strasbourg court, and the Human Rights Act which protects convention rights in UK law. They allege that the system distorts justice, preventing evil people from getting their just deserts. It hampers governments in tackling terrorism and serious crime. They decry rulings preventing deportation to a country where there is a risk of torture or the death penalty. They object when a court decides that bed and breakfast owners cannot refuse to accommodate a gay couple. They express outrage when our soldiers are made to account for complicity in torture. They accuse Strasbourg of overriding our sovereign parliament. If the UK were to leave the EU after next monthâ€™s referendum it would remove crucial rights protection enshrined in EU law, but our fundamental rights would still be protected by the convention â€“ the jewel in the crown of the 47-nation Council of Europe, often confused with the EU. That is why the home secretary, Theresa May, said last month, â€œIf we want to reform human rights laws in this country, it isnâ€™t the EU we should leave but the ECHR and the jurisdiction of its court.â€\\x9d The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, affirmed the governmentâ€™s intention to replace our Human Rights Act with a â€œBritish bill of rightsâ€\\x9d. He told parliament that the government would â€œrule out absolutely nothing in getting that doneâ€\\x9d, but preferred the UK to remain a member of the European convention. That threat remains â€“ whatever the outcome of the EU referendum. May seemingly favours a position that would delight a medieval king â€“ a government-controlled legislature that enjoys absolute power. The governmentâ€™s attitude to the convention pleases Vladimir Putinâ€™s Russia. After the UKâ€™s repeated failure to implement Strasbourgâ€™s ruling against a blanket ban on prisoner voting, Russia indicated it would follow suit â€“ then passed a law allowing the Russian constitution to trump the convention. British withdrawal from the convention would set a terrible example to Europeâ€™s pseudo-democracies as well as staining the UKâ€™s good reputation for upholding the rule of law. May says she wants the UK to be part of international institutions, so long as they do not â€œbind the hands of parliamentâ€\\x9d. But, as Winston Churchill understood, the European convention ensures that national sovereignty cannot be used to shield the perpetrators of human rights abuses from being brought to account. Even parliament must respect international law. It was once said that power is delightful and absolute power absolutely delightful. Fifty years ago, official discretion was poorly controlled and human rights were weakly protected. Unlike the rest of Europe and most of the common law world, we had (and have) no written constitution protecting us â€“ no binding ethical code to guide decision takers. In 1966, UK citizens were granted the right to take complaints of human rights violations to Strasbourg, but we had no Human Rights Act to bring the convention rights into our domestic law. Parliament under government control can behave like an elected dictatorship â€“ tyranny by the governing majority. That is what happened in 1968 when parliament approved the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, a racist law depriving British-Asian refugees from east Africa of their right to live and work in the country of which they were citizens, in breach of a promise made to them. Fifty years ago, our judges were executive-minded, interpreting acts of parliament narrowly. Discrimination was prevalent and not unlawful. There was no positive right to free speech or respect for privacy. Excessive official secrecy was deep-rooted in Whitehall. We had no right of public access to government information. Male homosexuality was a crime. The right to liberty could be taken away easily by legislation. In Northern Ireland, majority rule was allowed to discriminate against the Catholic community, resulting in sectarian violence and division. For want of remedies at home, vulnerable minorities needed the convention and Strasbourg to come to their rescue â€“ which it did, again and again. European judicial oversight protected the right of gay men and lesbians to love at a time when this was still criminal in Northern Ireland. It ruled that parliament had subjected British-Asians to racial discrimination and degrading treatment. Strasbourg protected the right to privacy, ruling that police could not tap telephones without clear legal authority. It prevented deportation to countries where there was a risk of torture. It gave redress to children when UK law still permitted corporal punishment in schools. Our own courts could not give remedies, until at last, in 1998, the Human Rights Act was passed. This enables everyone to bring complaints of UK human rights violations (other than by parliament itself) in British courts. We rely on the act and the convention to protect everyone, popular and reviled, against abuses of public power. In the absence of a written constitution, the act and the convention are the bedrock of our democracy based on the rule of law. The Human Rights Act is not perfect. It relies on a treaty that was not designed to be a national constitution. No other country does that. But NGOs rightly warn that the governmentâ€™s threat to replace it with a new-fangled British bill of rights is fraught with danger. A bill crafted by the present government may deprive victims of the right to seek redress from Strasbourg or weaken protection against the abuse of parliamentary powers. These fears are not fanciful. They were echoed last week by the House of Lords EU select committee, which found â€œserious questions over the feasibility and value of a British bill of rights of the sort described by the secretary of stateâ€\\x9d. The committee rightly cautioned that there was â€œa forceful caseâ€\\x9d for a rethink. The rights contained in the convention are embedded in the devolution acts â€“ to protect against abuse by the devolved institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A home-grown bill of rights would make sense only as part of a new UK constitutional settlement â€“ and only if its protections were at least as strong as they are currently. Without a new constitutional settlement, a British bill of rights, shorn of the protection of the convention and the court, would be much weaker than the Human Rights Act. That is precisely why we must fight any attempt to damage the umbilical cord connecting us to Strasbourg. The bill of rights commission, of which I was a member, consulted widely and found massive support for the Human Rights Act. We made it clear in our report that â€œany future debate on a UK bill of rights must be acutely sensitive to issues of devolution and, in the case of Scotland, to possible independence, and it must involve the devolved administrationsâ€\\x9d. To understand the rupture that would be caused by the government imposing a so-called â€œBritishâ€\\x9d bill on the rest of the UK, look only to Scotland. The SNP has vowed to fight a British bill of rights tooth and nail. And the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has spoken in open disagreement with David Cameronâ€™s government. Human rights are not the gift of politicians and bureaucrats. They are our birthright â€“ part of our common humanity. They need to be protected against the abuse of power. That is an idea we must fight for. Anthony Lesterâ€™s book, Five Ideas to Fight For: How Our Freedom is Under Threat and Why it Matters, is published by Oneworld',\n",
              "  \"Millionaires' new challenge: they're not rich enough for private banking So youâ€™ve just sold those Facebook shares that your high school buddy, Mark Zuckerberg, let you buy years before it went public, and youâ€™ve made an after-tax profit of $4m. Youâ€™re feeling very, very rich. Until, that is, you talk to a private bank that specializes in managing money for rich people. Thatâ€™s when you realize that youâ€™re nothing more than a â€œsingle-digit millionaireâ€\\x9d. Youâ€™re just not that special. In fact, the rate at which the ranks of millionaires is expanding is so great, youâ€™re actually pretty boring. Last year alone, the US welcomed 300,000 new millionaires: that translates into a growth rate of 3%, outpacing the growth in the US gross domestic product. In fact, there are now so many millionaires out there that the private banking system simply canâ€™t cope. JP Morgan Chaseâ€™s private bank has been raising the minimum amount of assets you need to become of its clients slowly and steadily for many years. Early this year, it announced that the minimum asset level to remain a private banking customer would double from $5m to $10m. When that takes effect early next year, about 10% of the bankâ€™s customers could be shuffled off to a less deluxe service, Private Client Direct. While a private banker might work with only 20 or so people, those working with â€œsingle digit millionairesâ€\\x9d might have 100 clients â€“ meaning that every one of them gets much less of their adviserâ€™s time and attention. JP Morganâ€™s move was partly aimed at convincing clients to shift any assets they might be stubbornly holding at other banks, bringing them up above the $10m threshold. But itâ€™s also a recognition that with the proliferation of millionaires, the private banks that youâ€™ve heard about â€“ the ones that will walk your dog, deliver gold bars with your monogram stamped into them and provide â€œwealth therapyâ€\\x9d so your children donâ€™t grow up entitled brats â€“ can pick and choose the clients that they deal with. A sign of just how ruthless they have become is that JP Morganâ€™s new rule even applies to the corporate lawyers with whom its investment bankers work closely on big deals. Until now, access to private banking programs have been among the perks offered to lawyers at firms like Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; now, the word is that they too will be shut out from this special treatment (and the access to hedge fund investments and other products and events that only the super-elite can tap into). Imagine how the poor lawyer who does a deal for a Silicon Valley billionaire must feel: heâ€™s negotiating with the very bankers who have thrown him out of their private club, on behalf of a client who is welcome to join it. If you donâ€™t feel much empathy for that hypothetical lawyer, worth millions, just because he canâ€™t qualify for super-special treatment from banks, I donâ€™t blame you. The fact is that as banks scramble to emphasize with wealthier clients, it comes at the expense of serving the rest of their clientele. JP Morganâ€™s private clients might feel offended at being demoted. On the other hand, those of us who merely toil for our money and whose net worth hasnâ€™t reached seven digits yet might be flattered to be invited to join Private Client Direct, a program serving the â€œmass affluentâ€\\x9d that offers after-hours access, a phone number to reach a banker any time and a few special perks. (Yes, even if that also involves some heavy pressure to buy the bankâ€™s proprietary investment products.) But even then, weâ€™ll need $500,000 in investments or $250,000 in deposits to qualify, and minimums for other such programs at other banks arenâ€™t very different. All of which brings me to an important point. Big banks are struggling to make money. Thatâ€™s why Wells Fargoâ€™s 5,300 rank-and-file employees were â€œencouragedâ€\\x9d, or at least not discouraged, to set up phony accounts in the names of existing clients, earning the bank more in fees (phew) and helping those employees hit sales targets. The bank opened 1.5m of these ghost accounts â€“ and has paid out $185m in penalties to various regulators, including a record $100m to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Itâ€™s also why the banks want to focus on their richest clients. Investing time and money in working with those of us who may only have a few thousand dollars to put to work is a waste of their resources â€“ in their eyes. The problem is that as they keep conducting triage, and denying access to investment guidance to one group after another, more and more of us will end up without the ability to turn to the banks to help us manage our investments. Letâ€™s face it, JP Morgan and other private banks can boost their investment minimums dramatically, but the incomes of most Americans are barely budging. Weâ€™re less and less likely to have the minimum level of assets that most investment counselors want to see before accepting us as a client. Robo-advisers â€“ the new breed of automated investment platforms that use algorithms to invest your money, taking into account factors such as age, income and risk tolerance â€“ offer sensible alternatives. But they work best for those people who are familiar with how financial markets work. Someone who isnâ€™t comfortable with markets, doesnâ€™t understand the concept of an index fund, isnâ€™t completely sure about how an asset allocation will help them, or isnâ€™t certain about the relationship between stocks and bonds may not want to simply hand over their money to a robo-adviser and then step away. So, big banks are in love with the billionaires who generate the bulk of their profits. Even the single-digit millionaires these days are starting to realize that they just donâ€™t count as much as they used to. But at least if those folks make an error or two along the way, they have financial padding to cushion their fall. The rest of us? Like everyone else, weâ€™re increasingly underserved by the banks and the rest of the financial services industry, and our needs are growing. A third of all Americans lack any retirement savings in a 401(k) plan or other tax-deferred account. That isnâ€™t the fault of the banks, but itâ€™s something that the banks could help to fix by offering even basic financial education and counselling to those who donâ€™t have balances with many, many digits. Then weâ€™d at least feel we were getting value for the account fees weâ€™re already paying. As it is, if I were a single-digit millionaire tossed out of the â€œparadiseâ€\\x9d of private banking, Iâ€™d walk away from that bank altogether. They donâ€™t want me? Heck, I donâ€™t want them either. There are plenty of independent financial advisers out there who â€“ unlike the banks â€“ arenâ€™t intent on making more money flogging their own proprietary investment products. Instead, they vow to put their clientsâ€™ financial interests before their own, come what may. Try one of those instead. For the rest of us? Well, we can keep demanding better financial education, however and whenever possible. And that the banks at least try to employ a better-functioning moral barometer.\",\n",

              "  \"Jodie Foster: 'I think this is the most risk-averse period in movie history' â€œIâ€™m not a spokesman for anything â€“ I know nothing,â€\\x9d Jodie Foster declared in Cannes on Wednesday, in front of a room of press attending her Kering Women in Motion talk. But over the course of her hour-long conversation with Varietyâ€™s Ramin Setoodeh, she proved herself wrong, passionately advocating on behalf of fellow female directors. The actor and film-maker is in Cannes to premiere her fourth feature as director, Money Monster, outside of competition. She previously directed 1991â€™s Little Man Tate, 1995â€™s Thanksgiving comedy Home for the Holidays and 2011â€™s Mel Gibson vehicle, The Beaver. The two-time Oscar winner, who famously began her career as a child actor, opened the discussion by reflecting on her 50 years in film, addressing how far she believes women have come in Hollywood despite the challenges they still face â€“ a recent report from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found that women directed just 7% of Hollywoodâ€™s top 250 films in 2014. â€œIâ€™ve seen drastic changes,â€\\x9d Foster said. â€œWhen I was younger, I only saw women as the script supervisor, makeup person or as fellow actors. I saw faces change as time went on. When I was young, there were a lot of men on movie sets ambling around these towns, getting into trouble and unhappy. Everything changed when women got onto movie sets. Suddenly it felt more like a family â€“ and movie sets became healthier.â€\\x9d Foster, who played the lead in hits including The Silence of the Lambs, Nell and Contact, was asked why projects with women in the lead have largely shifted to the independent film arena, as well as television. â€œI think studio executives are scared, period,â€\\x9d Foster said. â€œI think this is the most risk-averse period in movie history. Now so many things have changed in terms of the economy, the structure of studios.â€\\x9d She urged the film-makers in the room â€œto realize the business is shiftingâ€\\x9d and â€œget used to the landscapeâ€\\x9d. â€œEvery film is a new invention,â€\\x9d Foster elaborated. â€œWeâ€™re not a factory where we make shoes and we keep making shoes. So the rules are going to be different. The conversation has to become as complex as possible to really attend to the issues.â€\\x9d Foster said that female directors looking to make an impact in a male-dominated industry need to be as adaptable as possible. â€œYou want to tell stories with whatever technology is happening,â€\\x9d Foster said. â€œIf youâ€™re telling them on iPhones, great. You roll with the time and stay relevant â€“ and adapt to whatâ€™s around you. Thereâ€™s a democratization that technology has brought thatâ€™s wonderful â€“ women can take advantage of them, minorities can.â€\\x9d Foster, who has also directed for television, taking on episodes of House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, meanwhile praised the medium for being â€œmore open to womenâ€\\x9d. Asked why women are afforded more opportunities on the small screen, both behind and in front of the lens, Foster offered: â€œFinancially, itâ€™s less of a risk.â€\\x9d â€œWhen you have less risk, youâ€™re willing to take more chances,â€\\x9d she added. Foster didnâ€™t concede that television is producing greater content than film, but did stress that â€œTV is where you go for narrativeâ€\\x9d nowadays, with studios so invested in releasing franchise films and tentpoles. Over the course of her acting career, Foster has only worked with one fellow female director: Mary Lambert, who directed her in the 1987 film Siesta. Asked how the experience of making a film with a woman differed from working with male film-makers, Foster said it all boils down to a directing style she describes as â€œgood parentingâ€\\x9d. â€œI was 23 or 24, and I needed somebody to tell me to change my behavior [on the set],â€\\x9d Foster recalled. â€œI wonâ€™t tell you what that was, but Mary took me aside sat me down and said, â€˜No, you canâ€™t do that. Thatâ€™s disrespectful.â€™ She took me aside the way a parent would. At that age, I really listened. I was really grateful that a director sat me down like a person. â€œOur leadership styles are informed by our mothers and how we were raised. If youâ€™re a woman, youâ€™re going to have a different leadership style based on your background.â€\\x9d On her own temperament as a director, Foster admitted to confusing people for being very direct with her colleagues on set. â€œI think men are often confused by women who donâ€™t follow traditional rules in conflict,â€\\x9d Foster said. â€œBut guess what: all they need to do is have more experiences with them. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a big plot of men putting women down in the film business â€“ the film industry is pretty progressive. Theyâ€™re just stuck with the same traditional models and theyâ€™re trying to figure out how to get around that. But they havenâ€™t had enough experiences with women to do that.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  \"Donald Trump's secretary of state search expands to include new raft of hopefuls Donald Trumpâ€™s very public auditions for the job of next US secretary of state look set for an extended run, as surprise new hopefuls were added the invitation list to ride the golden elevator to the top of Trump Tower. Among the new names floated in press leaks on Monday were Jon Huntsman, former Utah governor and ambassador to China, Rex Tillerson, the chief executive officer of the Exxon Mobil oil company and Natoâ€™s former commander in Europe, and the retired admiral James Stavridis. The expanded search will come as a disappointment to the four men who were on the shortlist last week: the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, the former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the retired general David Petraeus and the Republican senator Bob Corker. They seemed headed for a final until the weekend, when Trump, a former reality TV star and a master of suspense, unveiled a new season with a fresh cast of characters. Not all the new names are necessarily in line for the secretary of state job. Juli Hanscom, a spokeswoman for the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, where Stavridis is the dean, confirmed that he would be going to New York to talk to the president-elect on Thursday but added: â€œThere has been no discussion of a position in the Trump administration.â€\\x9d Stavridis, a registered independent, was vetted by the Hillary Clinton campaign in July as a possible running mate. The former supreme allied commander in Europe (Saceur) derided Trumpâ€™s foreign policy, after the candidate gave an interview to the New York Times suggesting US protection for Nato allies could depend on if â€œthey had met their obligations to usâ€\\x9d. â€œI can picture the scene: national security advisor Tiffany Trump walks into the Oval Office with a load of charts on trade policy, basing agreements, cost-sharing, and balance of payments â€“ all while Russian troops are pouring into Estonia,â€\\x9d Stavridis wrote in Foreign Policy. â€œUnfortunately, his reckless proposals would deeply damage the underpinnings of the global system and work to Americaâ€™s profound disadvantage.â€\\x9d Huntsman wavered in his loyalties over the course of the campaign, publicly withdrawing support from Trump after a video surfaced in October in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women. Huntsman urged Trump to drop out of the race and let his running mate compete for the presidency instead. â€œIâ€™m around to serve my country. Iâ€™ve always believed in that, and any way I can help I can always stand up, salute and do what I can,â€\\x9d Huntsman told NBC News on Monday. He defended Trumpâ€™s controversial decision to hold a phone conversation with the Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen, which broke a 37-year diplomatic norm and upset Beijing. â€œIt provides space and leverage in the overall US-China relationship. Itâ€™s been tried and talked before, but what is different this time is youâ€™ve got a businessman who has become president of the United States, who understands real leverage and how to find real leverage in that relationship,â€\\x9d he said. Huntsman, who speaks Mandarin Chinese, was appointed ambassador to China by Barack Obama in 2009 and served there until 2011 when he resigned and returned to the US to stage a presidential campaign. Forbes magazine noted that if Huntsman were nominated as secretary of state, he would be the third scion of a billionaire family to be picked for Trumpâ€™s cabinet. The 56-year-old Utah politicianâ€™s father founded Huntsman Corp, a Texas-based chemical company. Like Romney, Huntsman comes from an established and wealthy Mormon family. Tillerson, the Exxon executive, is due to meet Trump on Tuesday. He is a prominent conservative businessman who has generally funded Republican campaigns, but did not contribute to the Trump presidential bid. Also mentioned in press leaks as being under consideration for the secretary of state job are the Californian Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, an outspoken supporter of Vladimir Putin (who recalled over the weekend a drunken arm-wrestling match in the early 1990s with the future Russian leader) and a Democratic senator from West Virginia, Joe Manchin, who backed Clinton in the campaign. Manchin met the president-elect last week, and was touted earlier as a possible energy secretary. Also on the newly extended list is John Bolton, an ultra-conservative former ambassador to the UN, who was thought to have dropped out of contention, but who visited Trump in New York on Friday and is said to be still under consideration. â€œItâ€™s true heâ€™s broadened the search,â€\\x9d Trumpâ€™s aide, Kellyanne Conway, said on Sunday. â€œHeâ€™s very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women, all of whom need to understand that their first and foremost responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-electâ€™s America first foreign policy and be loyal to his view of the world.â€\\x9d Trumpâ€™s cabinet hiring process has been far more public than previous presidential transitions, so although it has not taken longer than its predecessors, to many observers it has felt that way. â€œThe time it has taken is not unusual. The fact he is talking to several candidates is not unusual. The fact he is turning it into a parade is quite different,â€\\x9d said Stephen Walt, professor of international affairs at Harvard Universityâ€™s Kennedy School of Government. â€œOne of the reasons people normally do it quietly is that you can avoid humiliating and embarrassing the people who donâ€™t get the job or are asked to serve in a more junior capacity.â€\\x9d The public way Trump has gone about it and the risk of wounded pride, Walt said, â€œis quite short-sighted, because the last thing you want is other Republicans or VIPs out there bad-mouthing you from the outsideâ€\\x9d. â€œTrump more than anything else views the transition as public relations. It is dominating the news cycles,â€\\x9d Walt said. â€œHe has turned it into an audience-participation spectacle, which creates enormous suspense.â€\\x9d Part of that spectacle so far has been a line of public figures who had failed to support or even derided the president-elect during the campaign, entering Trump Tower in recent days and then emerging, singing his praises.\",\n",
              "  'The Clan review â€“ grisly kidnap drama has sledgehammer punch Argentinian film-maker Pablo Trapero lands a sledgehammer punch with this terrifically well-made movie, which incidentally contains the most gobsmackingly realistic attempted suicide scene I think I have ever seen in any film. Itâ€™s the queasily horrifying story of the notorious Puccio crime family in post-junta 1980s Argentina who maintained the grisly totalitarian craft of â€œdisappearingâ€\\x9d people, effectively repurposing it into the lucrative business of kidnapping. Traperoâ€™s movie persuasively suggests that this family, carrying on its comfortably haute bourgeois existence while hostages were chained up in the cellar, was maintaining a chillingly dysfunctional denial about what was happening. In some ways, it is like something by Haneke (The Seventh Continent, say), although Scorsese might admire the brash way Trapero deploys a pop soundtrack: in this case, the Kinksâ€™ Sunny Afternoon. Guillermo Francella plays the blank-eyed clan capo and paterfamilias ArquÃ\\xadmedes Puccio, who controls his family with his mesmeric and lizardly gaze â€“ especially favourite son Alex (Peter Lanzani) â€“ and somehow believes that his activities are licensed by the still potent, unseen military forces who will surely soon return in triumph once Argentinaâ€™s futile experiment with democracy is over. His unsettling calm is the most disturbing aspect of the film.',\n",
              "  'Costs of overdrafts to fall as part of UK banks overhaul Banks will be forced to publish their maximum charges for unauthorised overdrafts as part of measures intended to save customers Â£1bn over five years, by encouraging switching and breaking the stranglehold of the big four on the high street. But even as the Competition and Markets Authority pledged the measures would halve the Â£1.2bn customers pay in unauthorised overdraft fees each year, consumer bodies, challenger banks and independent analysts said they would do little to crack the 77% market share Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays have on current accounts. The competition watchdog has spent Â£5m on its investigation, first announced in July 2014 at a time when the Labour party was promising to create new banks. The banking industry generates Â£14bn of revenue a year from current accounts and small businesses, and the watchdog calculated overdraft users could save up to Â£153 on average by switching accounts. Alasdair Smith, chair of the CMAâ€™s retail banking inquiry, is relying on the use of new technology to crack a competition conundrum that has sparked 10 investigations in the last 20 years. The CMA is ordering the major players to upgrade their IT capabilities by creating an online system that would enable price comparison websites to offer better information on rival products. This has to be done by the end of March 2017. The other measures include: Requiring that banks set out a monthly maximum charge for unauthorised overdrafts â€“ but the watchdog held back from imposing an industry-wide cap on charges, as some had hoped. Customers to be warned by text when they go overdrawn. The Financial Conduct Authority reviewing ideas for banks to publish their service records, with data collected twice a year. Willingness to recommend the account to a friend could be included. FCA working on prompts banks could send to customers to move their accounts, such as when branches close. The beefing up of the current account switching service set up three years ago. Innovation charity Nesta offering a Â£5m challenge prize â€“ funded by the banks â€“ for financial technology companies to create ways for small businesses to move accounts, although this will not be completed until mid-2018. Banks providing standard rates for small business loans and overdrafts up to Â£25,000. Smith said the proposed saving to customers over five years of Â£1bn was based on an increase in the number of customers switching their current accounts each year from 3% to 4%. The move on overdraft charges was welcomed by Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, who said the charity helped with 55,000 overdraft problems a year, where in some cases consumers are charged more than they would be for a payday loan. But Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns at consumer body Which?, said: â€œAfter 18 months this inquiry achieved little more than to propose basic information measures that the big banks should have introduced years ago. Steps to stimulate switching are welcome but the chance to deliver better banking for all consumers has been missed.â€\\x9d Smith defended the CMAâ€™s decision to back away from avoiding radical measures such as breaking up banks or demanding account portability, whereby customers keep their account number, because it could have cost up to Â£10bn. Criticised after its preliminary report in October for not taking bold enough measures, the CMA also incurred the wrath of challenger banks by refusing to ban â€œfree-if-in-creditâ€\\x9d banking accounts, which rival banks say hide the true costs of banking. Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, spun out of Lloyds, said the CMA had missed a golden opportunity by refusing to require banks to issue customers with monthly bills to tackle the hidden costs of free banking. John Lyons, retail and commercial banking leader and partner at PwC, said: â€œA market which was seen by many as a closed shop despite new entrants looking to make inroads is unlikely to be transformed by the range of proposed remedies published today.â€\\x9d Banks analyst Sandy Chen at Cenkos said Lloyds had most to lose because of its high share of current accounts at around 25% and its reliance on them for generating income. Customers rarely move their accounts: nearly 60% of personal customers have stayed with the same bank for more than 10 years. More than 90% of small businesses get their business loans from the bank where they have their current account. â€œThere is therefore not going to be a single â€˜magic bulletâ€™ that puts everything right,â€\\x9d the CMAâ€™s 400 page report said. Smith said: â€œI donâ€™t accept ... that this is a missed opportunity ... Iâ€™d rather do it properly than do it quickly. For too long, banks have been able to sit back and not work hard enough for their personal and small business customers. â€œWe believe the strong and innovative package of measures we are proposing will give customers the information and tools they really need to get a better deal out of the banks. They will also protect those who fall into overdraft from being stung with unexpected fees.â€\\x9d The CMA estimates that the industry will incur costs of Â£75mâ€“ Â£110m to implement the changes. A consultation runs until 7 June before the final report on 12 August. Harriett Baldwin, the Treasury minister, said the report was â€œan important piece of work and we stand ready to take action once the final report is published in the summerâ€\\x9d.',\n",
              "  'â€˜In Wales social work is recognised and valued. Itâ€™s a better place to beâ€™ Nick Lovell crosses the border twice a day as he commutes between his English home and his job as a social worker in Wales. Heâ€™s not alone. â€œI know a number of social workers who live in England but would rather work in Wales,â€\\x9d he says. â€œItâ€™s a better place to be a social worker. Social work is recognised and valued; in England I donâ€™t think it is.â€\\x9d Lovell, interim chair for the British Association of Social Workers Cymru, was a social worker in London, before choosing to work in a country where he feels the profession is more appreciated. He is not surprised then by the findings of research published last month, which showed that social workers in Wales enjoy their jobs more than their peers across the UK â€“ 87% said they were happy, compared with 79% across the UK as a whole and as few as 69% in south-west England. The findings, due to be presented to an audience of Welsh social workers in Cardiff tomorrow, also show that Wales scores better across a range of indicators such as workload, support from employers and health and social care integration. The Welsh and English social work landscapes have been diverging for some years. The differences include both structural ones â€“ more local authorities in Wales have held on to combined adult and childrenâ€™s social services departments than in England, for example â€“ and variations in education and training. The legislative landscape is also different: post-devolution reform has seen a Social Services and Wellbeing Act passed in Wales. Another act, reforming the regulatory and inspection framework, is due for royal assent this month. Gerry Evans is director of standards and regulations at the Care Council for Wales, which regulates the workforce and is due to take on a wider role driving standards and innovation next year under the regulation reforms. He says the sector has worked hard to support social workers and encourage them to stay in the profession. â€œI think weâ€™ve got to a pretty stable position in the last five years or so in terms of turnover, after a low period where turnover was high and there was generally low morale,â€\\x9d he says. â€œThe key issue is that the whole of the sector and employers recognise the importance of investing in and supporting the workforce.â€\\x9d In particular, he points to the strong partnerships between local authorities and universities in Wales. Under these arrangements, councils have to agree to host students to ensure they get the right experience, in stark contrast to England where a shortage of placements has been a longstanding issue. And the Care Council has also introduced a professional development programme once social workers are qualified â€“ again a more formal arrangement than in England. An evaluation of the first year of the programme found 99% of social workers who took part were proud of being a social worker and 91% thought they would be working in social work in five yearsâ€™ time. â€œIt is critical to ensure the most experienced staff can stay in practice, which many want to do, rather than being taken into management to progress their career,â€\\x9d says Evans. Liz Majer, director of social services at Blaenau Gwent council in South Wales and lead director for workforce at the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, also believes that the fact that Wales is a relatively small country helps. â€œIn my own authority, I meet my social workers â€“ I am sure the director in Birmingham canâ€™t get out to meet their social workers in the same way,â€\\x9d she says. â€œYou can have those conversations and understand the front line, that personal contact is very important. And because we are smaller, the interface with politicians, managers and regulators is a lot closer. Itâ€™s all about relationships.â€\\x9d Social services in Wales have been relatively protected from cuts. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that while health spending in Wales fell by 2% between 2010 and 2015, spending on social services only fell by 0.8% â€“ compared with a 4.3% rise in health spending in England over the same period, but a 11.5% cut to social services. The Welsh governmentâ€™s minister for health and social services, Mark Drakeford, says there has been a â€œvery deliberate decisionâ€\\x9d in Wales to try to protect the system in the round. â€œItâ€™s really no help to an individual to find themselves trapped in one part of system because another part of the system has been starved of resources,â€\\x9d he says. Drakeford, who trained as a social worker, also sees in the higher satisfaction of social workers in Wales a reflection of a more positive environment for the profession. â€œThe approach to social work and social services has always been a cross-party one with very broad support,â€\\x9d he says. â€œYou donâ€™t hear in the Welsh context some of the language used in some parts of the media in England about social workers and the job they do. I would hope people feel that they do a job thatâ€™s valued and supported by the political climate we have in Wales. We have a progressive agenda for social work and one worked out with people doing the job rather than simply being imposed on them..â€\\x9d Central to that is the 2014 legislation, which, he claims, will ensure that people are seen â€œnot as problems to be solved but as coproducers of their own futureâ€\\x9d. It is an approach some have characterised as a return to the old values of social work. Evans says: â€œIt has better aligned the social work role to the ethos and principles of why people go into social work â€“ working alongside people on their difficulties, as opposed to a heavy emphasis on assessment and care managementâ€\\x9d. Yet despite the reforms, significant challenges remain for social work in Wales,, Drakeford concedes. â€œIâ€™m not going to say for a single minute that for frontline social workers in Wales the work doesnâ€™t have real pressures of demand and of bureaucracy, which we are doing our best to slim down.â€\\x9d â€œWe have an ambition to sustain the basic framework of the welfare state that weâ€™ve been so lucky to inherit in our lives. The pressures of poverty are absolutely real in the lives of many Welsh families and communities. The deeply flawed austerity regime followed in Westminster is taking millions and millions of pounds out of pockets of people across the land. Our aim is for services to be alongside those people to do what we can to mitigate the impact and for our public services to continue to be part of the glue that knits together communities and societyâ€\\x9d Majer says that although social services in Wales havenâ€™t yet been hit as hard as in England, financial pressures are set to increase. â€œI know colleagues are having to look at cutbacks in social work and that would be very concerning as we know caseload pressures would result in more stress,â€\\x9d she says. On the frontline, thereâ€™s certainly an expectation that there are tough times ahead. But as Lovell puts it, social work has never been an easy choice. â€œIâ€™ve been a social worker for 30 years and Iâ€™ve certainly never worked in the golden years of social work having endless resources. Itâ€™s always been tight, but itâ€™s getting tighter. Our priory is making sure social workers are supported and enabled to do the job they are employed to do in increasingly difficult times and that they get the support and recognition they deserve.â€\\x9d For more details about the Social Lives survey in Wales contact stacey- rebekka.karlsson@theguardian.com',\n",
              "  'Leave.EU may challenge extension of voter registration deadline Arron Banks, the funder of the unofficial Brexit campaign Leave.EU, is considering whether to legally challenge to the governmentâ€™s decision to extend the deadline for registering to vote in the EU referendum by 48 hours. David Cameron promised to force through legislation to extend the deadline to midnight on Thursday after the governmentâ€™s registration website was overwhelmed by a surge in applications in the the final hours before the initial deadline of midnight on Tuesday. Banks, an insurance millionaire, revealed that his lawyers were examining the decision. In a statement he said: â€œWe believe it is unconstitutional at best and have been advised that with legitimate cause we could challenge this extension. â€œWe are therefore considering all available legal options with our legal team, with a view to potentially launching a judicial review now and after the outcome of the referendum on 23 June.â€\\x9d Vote Leave â€“ the official Brexit campaign, which is not funded by Banks â€“ also criticised the decision to extend registrations, but has not suggested it will sue the government. The possible judicial review comes after 242,000 people applied to register to vote on Wednesday â€“ a day after the initial deadline. At least as many are likely to apply on Thursday, after a record 525,000 applied on Tuesday. It is thought that the remain campaign stands most to gain from late registrations as most of those applying are younger voters. Pollsters point out that young people are twice as likely to vote to remain in the EU, but under-25s are only half as likely to vote as over-65s. The number who will actually be given the right to vote is likely to be significantly smaller than the number applying. Philip Cowley, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, pointed out that many people apply to register to vote who are either already registered, or who turn out to be ineligible. The pro-Brexit Tory Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, questioned why the government was failing to put in the same effort to find misregistered EU citizens who had been issued polling cards. â€œThe government is having to rewrite the rules to clear up a shambles of their own making. Why are they not acting with the same vigour over weeding out misregistered EU nationals who have been sent polling cards and even postal ballots, but who are not eligible?â€\\x9d Jenkin said. He warned that if the referendum result was close, the decision could be challenged by a judicial review because of the deadlineâ€™s extension. A source within the remain campaign said: â€œArron Banks is free to waste his money in any way he sees fit. But itâ€™s extraordinary that the leave campaigns are so angered by the prospect of people wanting to take part in the democratic process.â€\\x9d Following emergency discussions with the Electoral Commission and opposition parties, the government plans to table a statutory instrument in parliament to amend the referendum conduct regulations, reducing from five to three the number of working days before the poll that the electoral lists must be published. This will extend the registration deadline to the end of Thursday, while preserving a separate five-day period for appeals against entries on the register. The websiteâ€™s collapse emerged at around 10.15pm on Tuesday when dozens of potential voters complained on Twitter that they could not access the website.',\n",
              "  'Stay out of EU affairs, leading MEP tells British government The British government has been given a blunt warning to stay out of the EUâ€™s post-Brexit business by a senior leader in the European parliament, who lambasted Boris Johnson for his â€œunbelievable arroganceâ€\\x9d and insisted Britain would have â€œno say any moreâ€\\x9d in the long-term future of Europe. Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest centre-right group in the European parliament, criticised the British foreign secretary for his support of Turkeyâ€™s EU membership, which has infuriated European politicians. The MEP spoke minutes after the European parliamentâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the UK may have only 14 months of proper negotiations to tie up its EU exit and pressed for talks to be completed by mid-2019. Johnson has irked many in Europe by offering to help Turkey join the EU despite Britainâ€™s looming departure. After becoming foreign secretary he reverted to his support for Turkeyâ€™s EU hopes, after being accused of stoking prejudice during the referendum campaign by suggesting Turkish migrants would flood into the UK if Britain stayed in the EU. Weber, a longstanding opponent of Turkey joining the EU, described Johnsonâ€™s support for Ankara as â€œunbelievableâ€\\x9d and â€œa purely arrogant provocationâ€\\x9d. Saying he could not respect Johnsonâ€™s actions, Weber urged the UK to refrain from getting involved in decisions about the EUâ€™s long-term future. â€œI ask the British government not to influence this discussion, which will go on over the next two, two-and-a-half years,â€\\x9d he said. â€œPlease step back; it is a question of fairness and respect. When you want to leave a club, you have no say any more in the long-term future of this club.â€\\x9d The MEP also called on the UK not to block EU defence cooperation, although the 27 remaining members struggle to forge a consensus, even without Britain obstructing the way. Weber was speaking after meeting David Davis, the secretary of state for Brexit, who was on a whistlestop tour of Strasbourg. On Monday, Davis met the European commissionâ€™s Brexit pointman, Michel Barnier, in Brussels for a coffee, and on Tuesday he met Verhofstadt. The EU is refusing substantial talks until the government triggers the article 50 exit process; some European officials think the British do not have much to say. And Weber said he had not heard anything new from Davis about what Brexit really meant. Only 60% of EU legislation relates to the single market, Weber said, while the rest covers areas such as research, cooperation on crime and migration. â€œBrexit means leaving: you cannot stay for 90% of the legislation and only have a Brexit on migration, that is not possible,â€\\x9d he said. Davis had told MEPs he wanted the UK to remain in the single market, according to Weber. But both Verhofstadt and Weber made clear that the UK could not have unfettered access to the single market without accepting the EUâ€™s core principles, including free movement of people. â€œI must stress again: Brexit means Brexit, that means leaving the European Union, that means cutting off relations ... and not cherry picking, not special relationships,â€\\x9d Weber said. Downing Street has repeatedly refused to rule out staying in the single market. A spokesman for Theresa May said: â€œWe are very clear that what we want is a trading relationship that allows UK companies to trade both with and within the single market and lets European businesses do the same.â€\\x9d Meanwhile, Verhofstadt said the window for negotiations was â€œ14 or 15 monthsâ€\\x9d, once political processes were taken into account, shaving months off the two-year timetable the UK government is counting on. Davis described his meeting with Verhofstadt as â€œgreat funâ€\\x9d and denied having compared the MEP to Satan. A jokey remark, where he said â€œget thee behind me, Satanâ€\\x9d, had been aimed at the chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, he told the BBC. He described Verhofstadt as â€œa very nice manâ€\\x9d who races British classic cars. Davis added: â€œWe got on very well. It was a very useful constructive conversation.â€\\x9d If May sticks to her promise of triggering article 50 by the end of March 2017, the 27 governments of the EU can be expected to agree a mandate by late April or early May, paving the way for serious talks to begin. Verhofstadt sees negotiations winding up in late 2018 to allow the European parliament to complete its internal processes. MEPs are anxious to complete the UKâ€™s exit before European parliament elections in mid-2019. Some governments, such as France, also see this as an unofficial deadline, but other member states are more relaxed on timing, so Verhofstadtâ€™s timetable is highly provisional. Verhofstadt also said Brexit was not his only priority, as he urged the EU to pull together in the face of Donald Trumpâ€™s election. In a striking intervention, he grouped the US president-elect with two of the worldâ€™s most powerful authoritarian leaders, Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin and Turkeyâ€™s Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan. Instead of â€œthe ring of friends around Europeâ€\\x9d, Verhofstadt said, he saw people who want to â€œbash and destroy our valuesâ€\\x9d. â€œWhat I see today is now Russia, Americans and Turks working together on European soil to destroy the European model,â€\\x9d he said. Elaborating on his theme, he said ErdoÄŸan wanted to shut down European movements in Turkey and Putin â€œopenly finance[d] extremists and populist parties everywhere in Europeâ€\\x9d, while Trumpâ€™s right-hand man appeared to be trying to â€œinfluence electionsâ€\\x9d in France and Germany. The Belgian MEP was referring to incoming White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the far-right Breitbart News, which recently revealed plans to launch sites in Germany and France. â€œWhat I see today is now Russia, Americans and Turks working together on European soil to destroy the European model,â€\\x9d Verhofstadt said. The European parliament has a very limited role in shaping EU foreign policy, so its representatives tend to be more outspoken than diplomats. Verhofstadt, a former prime minister of Belgium and lifelong federalist, urged the EU to â€œfight backâ€\\x9d against â€œthe ring of autocratsâ€\\x9d by working together on defence and reforming the eurozone.',\n",
              "  'â€˜Iâ€™m not a thing to be pitiedâ€™: the disability backlash against Me Before You When the marketing team behind Me Before You came up with the hashtag #LiveBoldly to promote this story of a young disabled man considering assisted dying, they could scarcely have predicted that it would be used to expose the movieâ€™s problematic message. â€œDo you really want us to #LiveBoldly or do you just want us to #diequickly?â€\\x9d asked one commenter during a Twitter Q&A session last week with the filmâ€™s star, Sam Claflin. He plays Will, a wealthy former playboy who becomes involved with Lou (Emilia Clarke), a kooky misfit in thrift-shop chic. Itâ€™s rather as if Thomas Crown had fallen for AmÃ©lie. The film, adapted by Jojo Moyes from her own best-selling novel, portrays the burgeoning romance between these two apparently mismatched souls. But their differences are not simply sartorial. Lou has full use of her body. Will has been quadriplegic since a road accident several years earlier. Before Lou became his carer, Will decided he wanted to kill himself. Now the Dignitas paperwork is in the post and it seems that Louâ€™s chipper disposition can do nothing to change his mind. A spoiler alert will be necessary for anyone who hasnâ€™t read the book and so wonâ€™t know that he goes ahead with his plan. The full meaning of the name â€œWillâ€\\x9d becomes clear only after he dies and leaves Lou more money than she has ever seen. It will be enough cash, he says, for her to swap her timid life for adventure. The problem, according to activists who picketed the filmâ€™s premiere last week, is this motto applies in this context only to the able-bodied â€“ and comes at the cost of a disabled manâ€™s life. Many of those same activists also used Twitter to take issue with the film. The hashtag #MeBeforeEuthanasia was used by @grindmastrgrant, who tweeted: â€œIâ€™m not your inspiration porn and Iâ€™m not a thing to be pitied or killed off to make the audience cry,â€\\x9d while @JohnBrianKelly wrote: â€œI have Willâ€™s disability. Stop killing me on film! #liveboldly, fight cripple snuff films.â€\\x9d The idea that it is better to be dead than disabled has been seen many times before. In Million Dollar Baby, it is expressed in a mercy killing. In Whose Life Is It Anyway? and The Sea Inside, it takes the form of a quadriplegic man fighting the medical establishment for his right to die. The familiar spectre of the worthless disabled body is hidden behind the apparently valiant struggle of an individual against the state. Of course, it would be wrong to pretend that suicide and disability are mutually exclusive. The Sea Inside is based on RamÃ³n Sampedroâ€™s life, while Me Before You is partly inspired by the 23-year-old rugby player Daniel James, who chose to kill himself after a severe spinal injury. (His parents said he was â€œnot prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existenceâ€\\x9d.) But the screen-time granted to these stories, to the exclusion of more diverse representations of disability, has helped plant in the public consciousness the notion that life is worth less when it resides in a disabled body. â€œWe have so few opportunities in the media to explore disability,â€\\x9d says the actor and activist Liz Carr, who participated in the protest. â€œBut there is a disproportionate number of stories which relate to the â€˜problemâ€™ of disability being solved by death. Television and film seem to love those individuals who want to die. Theyâ€™re less keen to cover the rest of us who might want to live but are struggling to get the health and social care resources to do so.â€\\x9d The screenplay offers one pre-emptive riposte to the charge that it is speaking for all disabled people. â€œI get that this could be a good life,â€\\x9d says Will. â€œBut itâ€™s not my life. I canâ€™t be the sort of man who accepts this.â€\\x9d Since Will is shown to be strong, determined and uncompromising, it seems clear that the â€œsort of manâ€\\x9d who would put up with a paralysed body and its demands could only be inferior to him. This problem could be tempered, if not solved, by the presence of just one disabled character to provide some contrast and show that suicide isnâ€™t the only option. But there isnâ€™t one. The film isolates Will entirely, stacking the odds so that the choice to take his own life is made to seem like the logical one. â€œWhen non-disabled people talk of suicide, theyâ€™re discouraged and offered prevention,â€\\x9d she says. â€œEven though itâ€™s legal, itâ€™s not seen as desirable. When a disabled person talks of it, though, suddenly the conversation is overtaken with words like â€˜choiceâ€™ and â€˜autonomyâ€™ and people are rushing to uphold these prized principles whilst talk of prevention and mental health support are rare. Will is not offered any psychiatric support. What kind of message is this that weâ€™re giving disabled people and the non-disabled audiences?â€\\x9d Only in its acknowledgement of economic disparity does Me Before You come close to being honest. Accompanying Will to a glitzy wedding, Lou puts it to him that he would not even be talking to her were she not his carer. In fact, she would most likely be serving the drinks at such a function. A working-class woman like her would be as invisible socially to him and his friends as the disabled are to the rest of society. Disability in popular culture often exists to allow the able-bodied to unlock their potential. Lou is a beneficiary of Willâ€™s death, not unlike the struggling novelist in Betty Blue, who is inspired to write his next book only once he has smothered his hospitalised girlfriend. But Louâ€™s story also plays like a chaste, romantic ideal dreamed up by the abstinence lobby. Will wonâ€™t be making any sexual demands on Lou. And, like the perfect terminally ill boyfriend in The Fault in Our Stars, he wonâ€™t stick around to get old and wrinkly: Lou can treasure the image of her handsome billionaire forever. As love stories go, itâ€™s every bit as creepy as Ghost, which suggested that the perfect relationship was exclusively spiritual, or Pretty Woman, which proposed the idea of prostitution as a short-cut to true love. One of the improvements that Will makes in Louâ€™s life is to open her eyes to foreign-language films. This he does by showing her Of Gods and Men, Xavier Beauvoisâ€™s 2010 drama inspired by the French Cistercian monks in Tibhirine, Algeria, who refused to flee in 1996 despite violence from Islamic extremists. The monks made themselves martyrs rather than forsake the area and its people. Willâ€™s choice is entirely symbolic: it prepares Lou, and the audience, for the idea of self-sacrifice. Somehow this manages to feel like an insult both to disabled people in general and those monks in particular. If their murder is analogous to Willâ€™s choice to kill himself so that Lou can have a buffer of wealth, then the stock-price of martyrdom has plummeted since the days of Joan of Arc. Itâ€™s typical of the soft-pedalling tendency found in Me Before You that it borrows the most evasive element of Beauvoisâ€™s film. When the monks trudge off to meet their terrible fate, it is in a blizzard; they fade from view prettily, in contrast to other characters seen having their throats slit. They get a send-off every bit as euphemistic as Thelma and Louise, or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Me Before You does the same for Will. One minute heâ€™s lying fetchingly in his bed at Dignitas, the next we dissolve to Lou receiving news of her windfall in a Parisian cafe. This movie which has stood proudly behind Willâ€™s decision to die seems in an awful hurry to conceal what that might entail. Death, like disabled people who choose to live boldly, is nowhere to be seen. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.',\n",
              "  'Premier League relegation battlers brace themselves for a telling weekend This might not be the end of the football season, yet as the old saying goes when the fourth round of the FA Cup heaves into view and the days begin to lengthen, you can see the end of the season from here. The good news for Newcastle, Sunderland and Aston Villa is that all three clubs have shown a slight upturn in form and fortune, in some cases very slight, over the past few weeks. The bad news, obviously, is that these grand old clubs still form the Premier Leagueâ€™s bottom three in mid-January. Actually it is worse than that. Mid-January has already gone, and after this weekendâ€™s fixtures January will have gone. The Premier League takes a break for the FA Cup next week, so it will be February before we know it. The better news for the three clubs in trouble, or at least the less bad news, is that this weekendâ€™s games are all winnable. Yes, I know that is a ridiculous thing to say. All games are theoretically winnable, though it may be truer of this season that all games are actually losable, and if our doughty trio had managed to win some of their previous winnable games they would be higher in the table than they are at the moment. Yet even so, Sunderland are at home to Bournemouth, Newcastle away at Watford, while Villa have the small matter of a Midlands derby at The Hawthorns. At the start of the season, had anyone told the bottom three they were going to need points in a hurry to end January on a positive note, they would not have been too frightened by the fixtures just detailed. Villa arguably have the most arduous task, what with being adrift at the bottom and away from home, but anything can happen in a local derby. The two north-east clubs play newly promoted sides, and if you cannot take points in extremis from such games you probably deserve to be down among the relegation candidates. The flaw in that theory is not difficult to spot. It is no longer the start of the season. After new year you are not really a newly promoted side any more, you are a Premier League team with more than half of your fixtures completed. And for most of the season Watford and Bournemouth have not been playing like newly promoted sides with scant experience of the top flight; they have been playing with confidence and no little application, picking up points against bigger opponents with some notable results. But, and here is the big question, where has it got them? Undoubtedly Watford and Bournemouth have been among the surprise successes of a generally surprising season but late January finds all three promoted sides in the bottom half of the table, with Bournemouth and Norwich (at home to Liverpool on Saturday since you ask, probably thankful that Luis SuÃ¡rez will not be around) looking particularly vulnerable to recoveries by the bigger clubs beneath them. Watford do not look in too much trouble. They are on the same points as Everton and even Roberto MartÃ\\xadnezâ€™s biggest critics have not mentioned relegation yet, though they have lost four straight league games since taking a point from Stamford Bridge on Boxing Day and it could be that top-flight fatigue, sometimes known as reality, is beginning to set in. Saturday may offer some pointers as to how the rest of the season plays out. Bournemouth gave themselves a lift with a convincing win over Norwich at the weekend, though they are still only three points above the drop zone. Should they lose at the Stadium of Light, and Sam Allardyce has probably had the fixture circled on his calendar for some time, Newcastle could close the gap with a win at Watford. There seems no obvious reason why Newcastle should win at Watford, except Steve McClarenâ€™s side finally seem to be improving while Quique SÃ¡nchez Flores needs to prove his players have not hit a wall. With Swansea at Everton on Sunday, where the home side really need to release the handbrake to prevent their managerâ€™s claims of a European finish looking silly â€“ for a team playing so well Everton have been stuck in 11th for far too long â€“ this could be the weekend for a few incremental yet important shifts in league position. Although nothing is ever decided in January, not even late January, February can turn into a long month for teams heading downwards in the table. Those that can see a glimmer of hope, on the other hand, especially ones already out of the FA Cup, can start counting out the games to the end of the season and working out exactly what they have to do. So to cut to the chase, before the last league games in January, it looks as if the two north-east clubs have a chance of escaping their present predicament, while Bournemouth, Norwich and Swansea are in danger of getting sucked down. One would imagine the three teams eventually relegated will come from the current bottom six. Chelsea are still theoretically in trouble, only one point ahead of Bournemouth, but no one seriously expects the Stamford Bridge crisis to get that much worse now. They dropped a couple of points at home at the weekend but Everton are a good side, and Chelsea probably regarded it as a point saved, if not stolen. West Bromwich are not as high in the table as they would like but appear capable of getting over the line in the 16 games that remain, as do Watford, assuming their slump does not continue for long enough to cause panic. Clearly this is all guesswork until a few more games have been played; it just happens that one or two fairly crucial matches are coming up this weekend. Not least the one at West Bromwich. The last rites were read over Villaâ€™s survival chances some weeks ago but the situation is not yet hopeless. On the final weekend in January last year Leicester were bottom of the table with 17 points, and look what has happened to them since. Villa are bottom with 12, with only two wins to their name, and although that does appear desperate, a win against local rivals on Saturday would take them to 15 and possibly signal a change in outlook. Villa do not appear to have Leicesterâ€™s squad strength, it must be said, but if they are going to do anything other than meekly accept their fate they need to start now. Although no prizes are ever handed out in January, there is no better time to start a recovery. After February, or to be more exact after the first week of March, the remaining games start to be expressed in single figures. Unless you happen to be Leicester, that is when teams near the bottom of the table usually find the season slipping away.',\n",
              "  'Cruz goes negative on Rubio as Iowa approaches â€“ campaign updates In a radio interview in Iowa on Friday, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum dredged up the conspiracy theory that Bill and Hillary Clinton were somehow responsible for the death of former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster in 1993. When asked about the latest revelation that 22 emails from Hillary Clintonâ€™s home server have been labeled top secret, the Republican presidential hopeful told WHO-AMâ€™s Simon Conway that this was an example of Democrats â€œcircling the wagon no matter what the case is.â€\\x9d He went on to say: â€œThatâ€™s what the left believe. Nothing they can do, well, look at what the Clintons were accused of with certain folks like Vince Foster. I was going to say short of murder but thereâ€™s even allegations that they did that.â€\\x9d Foster, a longtime friend of the Clintons who was under intense pressure from his White House job, committed suicide in July 1993. Fringe conservative groups in the 1990s long sought to push the discredited theory that Foster was murdered by Bill and Hillary Clinton and his death was subject to an elaborate coverup. This allegation has been disproven by multiple investigators, including special prosecutor Ken Starr, although it has continued to periodically resurface. When asked for clarification about the remark, a Santorum spokesman told the that the presidential hopeful was â€œbeing facetiousâ€\\x9d in the statement and simply trying to make a joke about the extent to which Democrats rally around the former secretary of state. The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment. It was ladiesâ€™ hour at the juice shop just blocks from the New Hampshire state capitol building on Friday â€“ and the woman of the hour was none other than feminists and author Gloria Steinem, reports Lauren Gambino in Concord, New Hampshire. Introduced as the â€œmother of feminismâ€\\x9d (to which she quickly interjected: â€œmore like sisterâ€\\x9d), Steinem told the mostly white-haired crowd that it was time to elect a woman to the highest office and that this woman must be Hillary Clinton. â€œIâ€™m not here to speak against Bernie,â€\\x9d Steinem said at a Women for Hillary event on Friday. â€œWe donâ€™t have to be against someone to understand that someone is better for this moment.â€\\x9d Steinem â€“ who had a black eye she said was from falling into a pothole as she ran to catch a cab â€“ told Clintonâ€™s female supporters that every vote could make a difference, especially when it came to electing women to office. â€œI want to give you a little ammunition here,â€\\x9d she began, recalling the 1982 US senate race in Missouri between Democrat Harriet Woods and Republican John Danforth. Woods, an activist and politician, presented a strong challenge to her Republican opponent, running a campaign powered by grassroots activism and the slogan, â€œGive â€˜em hell, Harriet.â€\\x9d When it came to voting day, Danforth defeated Woods by a margin of less than two percentage points, just a few thousand votes, Steinem said. â€œIf Danforth hadnâ€™t been senator, Clarence Thomas wouldnâ€™t have gone with him to Washington as a staff member,â€\\x9d Steinem said. Several women in the audience groaned and gasped. â€œIf Thomas hadnâ€™t been visible in Washington as a rare African American who opposed his communityâ€™s majority views, he wouldnâ€™t have been appointed by the first President Bush to head and to disempower the equal employment opportunities commission and then to sit on the DC court of appeals.â€\\x9d She went on to tell of Thomasâ€™s supreme court appointment, and his vote in crucial 5-4 decisions, including the decision to halt a recount of the Florida ballots in the 2000 presidential election, which therefore ceded the presidency to George Bush. Steinem said that if a recount had been allowed to take place, the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, might have won the election. If he had, she said, climate change would have been at the forefront of the political agenda and the nation may have avoided intervening in Iraq. â€œI could go on, but I just want to say, that is the lost nail of a couple thousands votes,â€\\x9d Steinem said. â€œAnd we are in a more crucial situation now.â€\\x9d Steinem was introduced by US senator Jeanne Shaheen, who broke a glass ceiling of her own when she became the first female governor of the state in 1997. Shaheen described a cartoon by the Concord Monitor after she was elected governor, that showed her standing in front of the state capitol with the remnants of the glass on the ground around her. â€œIt was great,â€\\x9d Shaheen said. â€œBut it only works if we have broken that glass ceiling for every woman in the country; for every woman in the world.â€\\x9d Hillary Clinton has a straightforward message in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, writes Sabrina Siddiqui in Dubuque, Iowa: Iâ€™m the candidate Republicans fear the most. The Democratic frontrunner, who remains locked in a competitive race with Bernie Sanders both here and in New Hampshire, has repeatedly emphasized electability as part of her closing pitch to voters in both of the early states. Clintonâ€™s argument has largely centered on the distinction between what she says is Sandersâ€™s idealism as opposed to her own pragmatism. â€œIâ€™d rather under-promise and over-deliver than vice versa,â€\\x9d Clinton told a crowd of roughly 450 in Dubuque on Friday. At an earlier stop in Des Moines, she described Sandersâ€™ plan for single-payer health care as â€œan idea that will never, ever come to passâ€\\x9d. Clintonâ€™s campaign has argued that Sandersâ€™s proposal would dismantle Obamacare, the presidentâ€™s popular health care law, and require a significant tax hike on most Americans. She also urged voters not to be swayed by Republican efforts to promote Sanders - Clinton and her campaign have seized on reports that the opposing party is trying to help boost the Vermont senator as a way of preemptively defeating her. Republicans are â€œjumping all overâ€\\x9d trying to influence the outcome of the Democratic Party, Clinton said. â€œThe last thing they want is to face me in a general election.â€\\x9d Today in Campaign 2016 If itâ€™s possible to be hungover from politics, weâ€™re feeling it. With two debates, a town hall forum, a veteran-focused â€œspecial event,â€\\x9d email releases and more polls than there are actual Des Moines residents, this week has been the campaign equivalent of a frat party the weekend before pledge week: exciting while it happens, but a disaster once you have to wake up and deal with the aftermath. Hereâ€™s a recap of todayâ€™s top stories: The Trump-less Fox News debate had a rating of 8.4%, or roughly 11 to 13 million viewers â€“ the second-lowest rating of the election so far.That figure is far lower than Fox Newsâ€™ first Republican debate back in August, when a record 24 million people tuned in. Trump called Ted Cruz is an anchor baby - in Canada. â€œI think thatâ€™s one of the reasons heâ€™s a nervous wreck,â€\\x9d Trump said. â€œNow theyâ€™re saying, I think, his career is over, right? â€¦ how about this, heâ€™s a citizen of Canada and heâ€™s a senator from Texas and heâ€™s a citizen of Canada joint with the US.â€\\x9d The Obama administration is withholding seven email chains found on former secretary of state Hillary Clintonâ€™s unsecured home email server because they contain â€œtop secretâ€\\x9d information, according to the Associated Press. The emails include messages related to â€œspecial access programs,â€\\x9d which have the potential to help identify confidential sources or clandestine government surveillance networks or programs. The state department will also partially censor 15 additional emails that contain top secret material. Three days before the Iowa caucuses, itâ€™s not good news for Clinton. There are only three days before Iowans decide the first state of the 2016 election. Stayed tuned here for the â€™s up-to-the-minute coverage of everything from Trump to Cruz, from Clinton to Carson, from Iowan sandwiches to New Hampshire bathroom graffiti. Porn icon Ron Jeremy has endorsed Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign for the White House, in one of the weirder headlines weâ€™ll type today. Jeremy, nicknamed â€œThe Hedgehogâ€\\x9d in the industry, told Buzzfeed that he couched his support of Clinton in his positive feelings towards her husbandâ€™s administration. â€œI got to shake hands with her husband,â€\\x9d Jeremy said. â€œWhen he was in office, she gave him a lot of advice. When sheâ€™s in office, heâ€™ll give her a lot of advice.â€\\x9d The actor was more skeptical of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Clintonâ€™s chief rival in the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination. â€œAmerica has spanned decades and decades with capitalism and democracy, weâ€™re gonna give it all up because of one schmuck?â€\\x9d he said. â€œOne Jewish schmuck - I can say that because Iâ€™m Jewish - one Jewish schmuck wants to become a leader and bring us all into socialism?â€\\x9d The billionaire Koch brothers are set to convene one of their famed retreats this weekend for several hundred of their fellow super-rich conservatives in Palm Springs, California, as observers forecast a record year for secret donations, dubbed dark money, to Koch-backed groups and other outfits from the NRA to the League of Conservation Voters, reports the â€™s Peter Stone: â€œGiven the trends weâ€™re seeing, we wouldnâ€™t be surprised if dark money spent on direct advocacy [in the US 2016 election] hit half a billion dollars,â€\\x9d said Viveca Novak, the editorial director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. â€œSpending by these groups in the 2016 cycle is way ahead of previous cycles, and [dark money groups] are more integrated into campaigns than weâ€™ve seen in the past.â€\\x9d In 2012, the center has reported, dark money groups spent over $300m, of which more than 80% came from Republican-leaning outfits. Dark money is the name for cash given to nonprofit organizations that can receive unlimited donations from corporations, individuals and unions without disclosing their donors. Under IRS regulations these tax-exempt groups are supposed to be promoting â€œsocial welfareâ€\\x9d and are not allowed to have politics as their primary purpose â€“ so generally they have to spend less than half their funds directly promoting candidates. Other so-called â€œissue adsâ€\\x9d paid for by these groups often look like thinly veiled campaign ads. The boom in dark money spending in recent elections came in the wake of thesupreme courtâ€™s 2010 Citizens United decision, which held that the first amendment allowed unlimited political spending by corporations and unions. That decision and other court rulings opened the floodgates to individuals, corporations and unions writing unlimited checks to outside groups, both Super Pacs and dark money outfits, which can directly promote federal candidates. Dark money spending rose from just under $6m in 2006 to $131m in 2010 following the decision. Read the full story here: Disgraced former New York governor Eliot Spitzer and his mother, real estate demi-billionaire Anne Spitzer, have donated $100,000 to a super PAC supporting former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s struggling presidential campaign, according to a report filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday. The super PAC in question, Generation Forward PAC, raised a mere $514,000 in the second half of last year, which makes the Spitzersâ€™ donation even weightier. The super PAC spent roughly $10,000 of that money on negative advertising targeting Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Spitzer, the scion of a real estate empire who became the stateâ€™s attorney general, resigned from office in 2009 after reports that he had been the client of a high-end sex worker came to light. Spitzer has been vocally critical of fellow New Yorker Clinton, calling her immigration stance â€œa metaphor for her vacillation.â€\\x9d At the time of the donation, Spitzer was in a relationship with Lis Smith, Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s deputy campaign manager. As Americans prepare to cast the first votes of the 2016 election race, the â€™s Dan Roberts determines what is at stake for the three Democratic and 11 Republican hopefuls: Hillary Clinton Lost the state in 2008 to an outsider called Barack Obama. Needs to stop the same happening again with Sanders to reassure nervous Democratic leaders. Bernie Sanders If the revolution starts anywhere, it needs to start here. A win could snowball, a heavy loss would be a buzzkill for the democratic socialist from Vermont. Martin Oâ€™Malley The former Maryland governor is likely to struggle to reach the 15% threshold in many Democratic precincts. Wipeout may spell lights out. Donald Trump New Yorkâ€™s bombastic billionaire is looking less confident after a no-show debate drama. Needs to win here to maintain an aura of impregnability. Ted Cruz Tarnished by failing to unequivocally back Iowaâ€™s corn ethanol industry and by Canada â€œbirtherâ€\\x9d distractions. A win or close second would banish doubts for the maverick from Texas and put him back on track to catch Trump. Marco Rubio Iowa is alien territory to the establishmentâ€™s best hope, but the Florida senatorâ€™s new evangelical-tailored message is gaining traction and should deliver him third place. Ben Carson The retired neurosurgeon is currently crashing from a brief polling high last November. He could disappear for good in Iowa but is likely to soldier on in hope of recapturing that brief momentum. Rand Paul A one-time darling of the libertarian right, the Kentucky senator is staging a late recovery in Iowa. Fourth place could save his campaign (for now). Jeb Bush The former frontrunner is banking on New Hampshire to salvage what is left of his campaign. Iowa threatens to be a disaster, but expectations are at least suitably low. Chris Christie Likewise, the New Jersey governor is more at home on the east coast, but even a handful of Iowan votes will be helpful when it comes to staging the establishment fightback in New Hampshire. Read the full analysis here: Jeb(!) Bushâ€™s campaign may be withering on the vine, but his Vine presence is blooming. Remember Lyndon LaRouche? Political activist, eight-time presidential candidate, economist, brainwasher, conspiracy theorist and convicted tax evader? Well, his Super PAC has endorsed former Maryland governor Martin Oâ€™Malley for president, a voice of support that the bottom-tier Democratic candidate could really use right now. In a moderately confusing post on LaRouchePACâ€™s website, the longtime political activist declared that â€œwe want active support, from us, to boost Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s campaign, because itâ€™s necessary that his campaign be boosted.â€\\x9d Weâ€™re going to boost this intervention, with LaRoucheâ€™s name on it - especially from and through Manhattan and nearby points. Thatâ€™s our strongest point ... And what weâ€™re saying to Oâ€™Malley is: weâ€™re suggesting strongly that you focus yourself on your own policy directly. We support your making this the issue, and we recognize our responsibility to make a contribution to that effect. We recommend Oâ€™Malley follow the indicated policy, and weâ€™ll commit ourselves to support that policy; we make ourselves answerable to support that program in the election. â€œIâ€™ll personally support his option if he wants to follow that option,â€\\x9d LaRouche said. The release continues: The US requires a human option as opposed to Hillary and Bernie Sanders. Oâ€™Malley has the option, if he wants to narrow the issues, of presenting something which will outflank these guys. I strongly recommend that the Oâ€™Malley campaign team do this: get rid of the dubious things, and go for a straightforward address to what the problem is, because Hillary is a fraud - her record is that of a fraud, since she capitulated to Obama. Sheâ€™s totally a stooge for Obama. A vote for Hillary is a vote for Obama, and weâ€™re not voting for Obama. Sanders is the same kind of thing: heâ€™s an opportunist who tries to patch something together to fool people. We donâ€™t see any clear option coming from him or her. You donâ€™t want a â€œline,â€\\x9d-- you want to solve the problems of the United States. So Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s got that going for him... The Obama administration will withhold seven email chains found on former secretary of state Hillary Clintonâ€™s unsecured home email server because they contain â€œtop secretâ€\\x9d information, according to the Associated Press. The seven emails, which total up to 37 pages, include messages related to â€œspecial access programs,â€\\x9d which have the potential to help identify confidential sources or clandestine government surveillance networks or programs. Additionally, the state department will partially censor 15 additional emails that contain top secret material, and will not include them in the newest batch of emails set to be released later today. State department officials would not indicate whether the content of the emails was classified as top secret at the time of their transmission - Clinton has previously defended the existence of classified materials found on her home server as being related to classified programs that had been discovered by the press - but told the Associated Press that diplomatic security has begun investigating. â€œThe documents are being upgraded at the request of the intelligence community because they contain a category of top secret information,â€\\x9d state department spokesman John Kirby told the Associated Press. Clinton, who is only three days away from the Iowa caucuses, has continued to insist that she neither sent nor received any classified materials that was designated as such at the time on her private email account. One of the unique culinary innovations of Iowa is the loose meat sandwich, popularized by local fast food chain Maid Rite. Itâ€™s a cross between a sloppy joe and a hamburger, with the patty replaced by loose meat but without the sauce that accompanies a sloppy joe. The sandwich is served with a spoon to scoop the meat which didnâ€™t stay on the bun. It comes with the option to add ketchup, mustard, onions and pickles to the sandwich. I stopped at one of the chainâ€™s newest franchises in Oskaloosa, Iowa, for lunch. From our inbox : Subject: Clint Eastwoodâ€™s thoughts on Ben Carson Clint Eastwood, in his own words, explaining why he likes Dr. Ben Carson might be our favorite candidate video since someone found Bernie Sandersâ€™ 404 message on his campaign website. According to the videoâ€™s caption, â€œTrump doesnâ€™t want you to watch this. Neither does Cruz, or the establishment. Watch it anyway. Maybe youâ€™ll feel lucky.â€\\x9d Well? Do ya? Do ya, punk? Fresh off loaning his voice to an anti-Marco Rubio ad currently being aired by Ted Cruzâ€™s presidential campaign, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has some thoughts on last nightâ€™s Republican presidential debate: â€œI was almost rightâ€\\x9d on Donald Trump attending the debate after all, Limbaugh said, but once Trump threw out his $5m demand at Fox News in exchange for his attendance, â€œI knew he wasnâ€™t gonna do it.â€\\x9d As for Trumpâ€™s event, â€œit was unlike any Trump event that has taken place,â€\\x9d primarily because â€œTrump was barely in it!â€\\x9d Instead, the billionaire frontrunner turned over his spot at the lectern to veterans, acolytes, donors, other presidential candidates and Adele - at least, by audio. Due to Trumpâ€™s absence from the debate stage three miles away, â€œCruz became the frontrunner by defaultâ€\\x9d - which, according to Limbaugh, wasnâ€™t nearly the place of honor that it might have been. â€œWithout Trump to take any incoming,â€\\x9d Limbaugh said, â€œall the incoming could be focused on Cruz.â€\\x9d The dynamic â€œautomatically made Cruz the target.â€\\x9d As for the debateâ€™s victor? â€œThere was one winner last night, and it wasnâ€™t even close, and it was Marco Rubio.â€\\x9d Three days before the Iowa caucuses, Texas senator Ted Cruz is shifting nearly every dollar his campaign has allocated for negative advertising from focusing on billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump to fellow freshman senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the New York Times reports. Although Cruz and Trump have been locked in a virtual tie in polls of likely caucus-goers for weeks, Cruz is redirecting the full force of his campaignâ€™s communications team towards Rubio, whose support has been steadily increasing in the waning days of the Iowa campaign. The change in priorities comes less than a week after Cruzâ€™s campaign began airing negative advertisement of any kind - the first anti-Trump spot, â€œNew York Values,â€\\x9d aired only three days ago. The first anti-Rubio ad, â€œTrust,â€\\x9d was launched on Thursday afternoon and focuses on Rubioâ€™s record on immigration. â€œRubio betrayed our trust,â€\\x9d the advertisement says, as a voiceover from an episode of Rush Limbaughâ€™s radio show calls the Florida senator â€œpart of a â€˜gang of eightâ€™ that tried to secure amnestyâ€\\x9d for undocumented immigrants. According to the Times, Cruzâ€™s campaign will continue to air a duo of positive spots about the Texas senator, but the rise of Rubio as a potential spoiler in the caucus has Cruzâ€™s advisers worried enough to shift focus away from Trump, who currently bests Rubio in nearly every public poll available. Spotted in a restroom in Iowa: The â€™s Ben Jacobs was not immediately available for comment. Three days before the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton is pulling out the big guns - and handing over control of her Snapchat account to husband and former president Bill Clinton. Donâ€™t worry - weâ€™ll be sure to screencap. In 2008, political guru Mark Penn dismissed then-senator Barack Obamaâ€™s massive following among Iowa college students by telling Hillary Clinton that his campaign rallies â€œlook like Facebook.â€\\x9d The massive youth turnout at the caucuses helped blow Clintonâ€™s expected win in Iowa out of the water, and helped ignite a movement that sent Obama to the White House. Eight years later, the â€™s Ben Jacobs reports, that same population of young, ultra-liberal students is on the verge of repeating history: On a college campus of 1,600 students, 1,280 people flocked to a gleaming new gymnasium to hear Sanders speak on a snowy afternoon that marked the first day of classes after winter break. The idealistic young students who flocked to him seemed unconcerned about his prospects in a general election. They were not concerned about the self-proclaimed socialistâ€™s perceived unelectability. â€œIf I have to vote for someone just because I think they are more electable thatâ€™s messed up,â€\\x9d said Thomas Grabinski, a recent college graduate. Others were confident about Sandersâ€™ prospects in a general election. â€œI think a lot of people in this country are liberal enough to vote that way,â€\\x9d said Charlotte Love, a student originally from near Asheville, North Carolina. The Sanders campaignâ€™s effort on campus is dominated by what one unaffiliated student described asâ€œBernie Brosâ€\\x9d, the strident, earnest and ardently liberal men who view Clinton with a certain contempt. They protest against other candidates and try to plant questions about capitalism to throw rivals off guard. â€œI almost feel like they are not as respectful of other peopleâ€™s opinions,â€\\x9d said John Lof, a high school student who volunteered for the campaign, guardedly. â€œI donâ€™t thing thatâ€™s Bernie in general but more people who side with the further left liberal part of the spectrum,â€\\x9d he added. â€œItâ€™s not every single Bernie supporter, but a fair amount.â€\\x9d Read the full story here: One of the great mysteries of the 2016 primary so far is turnout: will the crowds who feel the Bern or revel in Trumpian glory actually show up to vote on Monday? DC bureau chief Dan Roberts is in Iowa with the campaigns, and has tried to parse out an answer. Iowans are made of sterner stuff than the Washington DC residents still paralysed by the blizzard of a week ago, but roads here are as endless as they are treacherous. A traffic accident recently claimed the life of a young campaign worker for former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and a smaller snow storm last Monday left ditches across the state littered with cars that had skidded off into the fields like some strange new crop variety. The vicissitudes of caucus season are a source of private frustration for candidates, many of whom believe this state of corn and hogs and evangelical Christians has undue influence because of its privileged spot at the outset of the lengthy primary process â€“ and can skew selection toward candidates who are unrepresentative of the national mood. Despite being accredited and arriving on-time to check in, my colleague Lauren Gambino and a handful of journalists were barred from Trumpâ€™s event at the Raddison hotel Nashua, New Hampshire. Initially, the press coordinator said there wasnâ€™t a problem. But then she sent her assistant to break the news. â€œIâ€™m sorry. Check in closed 40 minutes ago,â€\\x9d he said. Thatâ€™s not what the email said. I showed him the email that said badges would be given to the press until 9.30am. He promised to come back with an explanation. After some minutes, the press coordinator once again appeared from behind a curtain. She approached us carefully, and stopped before crossing the security line â€“ as if we journalists would suddenly turn the tables after months of being ridiculed and belittled by her boss. â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€\\x9d she said, feigning remorse. â€œThe Fire Marshall said we are at capacity.â€\\x9d A moment ago the excuse was that we were late. Now we were on time but the event was at capacity â€“ even though we had been approved and had reserved spots. After some bickering, she said simply: â€œTry coming earlier next time.â€\\x9d She then turned on her heels and disappeared behind the blue curtain. All was not lost, though. Lauren still got to interview the Trump faithful waiting outside the hotel â€“ many of whom were also denied entry. Maria Rawlings of Nashua came to see Donald trump for the fourth time on Friday morning, but as had happened to her once before, she didnâ€™t make the cut. Rawlings says sheâ€™s an independent but thinks Trump offers the best vision for the country. She said he could work on his delivery, and maybe tone down his rhetoric, but at heart she believed he was a good person who had the business acumen to restore the countryâ€™s sagging middle class. Rawlings said she intended to watch the Trump-less debate but fell asleep watching the earlier one. She called Trumpâ€™s stunt not to appear in the debate last night â€œstrategicâ€\\x9d but worried how it might affect his campaign. â€œIâ€™m worried that decision will hurt him but I hope it doesnâ€™t,â€\\x9d she said. As this reporter set out on the long hike back to the car, she passed Rawlings and her two friends standing outside the back entrance to the hotel. â€œDo you think Donald will come this wayâ€\\x9d She asked. She smiled. â€œWeâ€™d really like to see him.â€\\x9d Elsewhere on the campaign trail: racial politics get some attention, though not on stage or in front of the cameras. Jeb Bush declares victory, Rubioâ€™s campaign is lowering expectations (via Politico) â€¦ â€¦ and Rand Paul finds an extremely tacky car. Trump finishes off his speech with his complaints about the economy, tailored for his New England audience. He says he would just tell companies like Ford andApple to bring jobs and factories back to the US. â€œI would tell the guys at Ford build it in Michigan â€¦ maybe New Hampshire.â€\\x9d Build it in this country, who the hell cares. Weâ€™re gonna get you plenty. By the way New Hampshire, New England, you guys got screwed. You lost so many businesses â€¦ You need jobs, not service stuff, you need jobs â€¦ Weâ€™re gonna take it back â€¦ I mean you were decimated, almost I would say more than anywhere else.â€\\x9d He says heâ€™ll â€œbring jobs back from China, from Japan, from Mexico â€¦ China is the greatest theft in the history of the world to this country.â€\\x9d â€œIâ€™m so glad I made this ridiculous trip â€¦ Go out and vote February 9th!â€\\x9d Also a problem is Ted Cruz, Trump says. â€œTed Cruz may not be a US citizen â€¦ Heâ€™s an anchor baby â€¦ Ted Cruz is an anchor baby in Canada, but Canada doesnâ€™t accept anchor babies, they just waited a long time.â€\\x9d I think thatâ€™s one of the reasons heâ€™s a nervous wreck â€¦ Now theyâ€™re saying, I think, his career is over, right? â€¦ how about this, heâ€™s a citizen of Canada and heâ€™s a senator from Texas and heâ€™s a citizen of Canada joint with the US. The billionaire says that his campaign is self-funded, a claim disproven repeatedly. He uses the line to mock Cruz for his loans to major Wall Street banks, including a loan from Goldman Sachs that the senator did not report as campaign rules require. He didnâ€™t know about Goldman Sachs loaning him money, and he didnâ€™t know about Citibank loaning him money. Other than that heâ€™s got a great memory. He waxes exasperated: â€œOh, these politicians, whatâ€™re we gonna do with them? â€¦ Remember that loan you got, Ted? â€¦ Iâ€™m having fun.â€\\x9d Trump is holding a rally in Nashua, New Hampshire, at the Radisson Hotel. â€œWe have a right to be angry, folks, we have a right.â€\\x9d The billionaireâ€™s in a generous mood this morning: heâ€™s mixed his usual dire proclamations â€“ trillions in debt, wounded veterans, immigration â€“ with a dose of hope. â€œWeâ€™re gonna put our country back on track.â€\\x9d He says that with â€œgreat guys to run your agenciesâ€\\x9d he can sort out the US no problem. But you need the right people. The problem with the agencies, with everything, we have political hacks. â€¦ Guys who gave political contributions to the Jebs of the world, to Ted Cruz, whoâ€™s totally controlled by the oil industry. Fear not, Trump goes on. He will prove a great negotiator on the world stage. â€œI get along great with China and the Chinese people.â€\\x9d I sell condos to the Chinese. With Mexico I have a great relationship, and I employ thousands and thousands of Hispanics, and theyâ€™re fantastic â€¦ The problem is their leaders â€¦ The leaders are too smart for our leaders, and theyâ€™re too cunning. Highlights of the Trump variety hour: An imitation of Jeb Bush as a lost and frightened child: â€œHeâ€™s probably looking for me â€¦ Has anyone seen Trump? Where is Trump?

Heâ€™s the greatest show on earth.â€\\x9d Iowans appreciate all the attention showered on them by candidates, but are they any good at choosing the eventual nominee? Not exactly. Courtesy Nadja Popovich of the â€™s interactive team. Democrats fare better after winning Iowa, history suggests. Trump won without showing up. Or Rubio or Bush or Paul did, because they showed up. Or Ben Carson lost. Or nobody can make up their minds, what with no actual votes cast or caucuses caucused on Thursday night. But one metric should at least give somebody bragging rates: ratings. Total viewership numbers should be released on Friday afternoon, but Nielsen data can provide some clue. The Trump-less Fox News debate had a rating of 8.4%, or roughly 11 to 13 million viewers â€“ the second lowest rating of the election so far. That figure is far lower than Fox Newsâ€™ first Republican debate back in August, when a record 24 million people (a 15.9% rating) tuned in. Viewership for Thursdayâ€™s debate is more comparable to the Fox Business Network debate from December, which had a 7.4 rating and drew about 11 million viewers. (Far fewer Americans get Fox Business Network in cable packages than Fox News.) MSNBC and CNN aired Trumpâ€™s competing event and had about a quarter of the viewers as Fox did for its debate. Both Trump and Fox live streamed their competing events for free; neither have released viewership numbers. Democratic debates have drawn fewer viewers than their Republican counterparts, in part because the party has scheduled several on weekends, before holidays and at the same time as high-profile sporting and entertainment events. The highest rated Democratic debate was held by CNN in October, with almost 16 million viewers. Debate reviews are in. Rupert Murdoch, the conservative media tycoon and owner of Fox News, liked what he saw. So did Trump. But this is not a poll â€¦ Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the groggy day after the final Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses. Last night, frontrunner Donald Trump declined to show, instead hosting a charity event supposedly for veterans â€¦ though its organizers declined to say which groups would receive donations. The other leading Republican candidates bickered â€“ over substance! â€“ on a stage in Des Moines. Marco Rubio sniped at Ted Cruz, the closest to Trump in the Iowa polls, and both faced awkward questions over their inconsistent histories on immigration. â€œThis is the lie that Tedâ€™s campaign is built on,â€\\x9d Rubio said of his fellow senator. Rand Paul similarly attacked what he called Cruzâ€™s â€œfalsenessâ€\\x9d. Nearly all the candidates had to do some damage control over their immigration positions. When Rubio accused former Florida governor Jeb Bush of changing his policy about eventual citizenship for undocumented people, Bush retorted: â€œSo did you, Marco.â€\\x9d Trumpâ€™s shadow loomed over the debate, even from off stage. â€œIâ€™m a maniac, and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat and ugly,â€\\x9d Cruz said, mocking the billionaire, who led a surreal variety show across town in protest of one of Fox Newsâ€™ moderators. Two minor candidates, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee â€“ both kept out of the main debate because of their subterranean poll numbers â€“ appeared at the event with Trump. An hour east of Des Moines, the Democratic primary race took on familiar overtones. At Grinnell College, where Hillary Clintonâ€™s supporters failed to muster a caucus for her eight years ago, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders wooed idealistic students. Clinton leads Sanders by double digits in averages of national polls, but the poll averages also show the senator nearly tied to the former secretary of state in Iowa, and leading her by 15 points in the second state of the primary, New Hampshire. Clinton has worked hard to pitch voters on her long experience as a senator and the countryâ€™s top diplomat â€“ and on the notion that only she can defeat a Republican in the general election. There are only three days before Iowans decide the first state of the 2016 election. For a few candidates, the race to shake hands and kiss the heads of babies is getting literal. The Trump-Cruz-Clinton-Sanders-Rubio-Bush battle to become the most powerful politician in the world has a lot more chaos to come. Weâ€™ll have all the updates here, with word from the trail from: DC bureau chief Dan Roberts, west coast bureau chief Paul Lewis, national reporter Lauren Gambino, political reporters Ben Jacobs and Sabrina Siddiqui â€¦ and Adam Gabbatt, who says heâ€™s a plumber.',\n",
              "  'Letter: How Muhammad Ali showed his love for Bangladesh In the late 1970s I headed a modest film production company in London and hit upon the idea to take Muhammad Ali to Bangladesh, then a new country which needed world recognition. After many trips to the US we got Ali to agree, but first there was a small matter to be settled in the ring. Ali had a fight pending against Leon Spinks, which he thought would be a walkover. Not so. Spinks beat Ali on points. Ali rang me from Los Angeles and said he could not face his fans since he had been beaten. I said: â€œNo Brother, they still love you as The Greatest. The whole of Bangladesh, from the president to the lowest peasant, is waiting for you. You must believe me.â€\\x9d He, ever the joker, lowered his voice and asked: â€œBrother Reg, are you serious?â€\\x9d I replied, â€œIn the name of Allah, I am dead serious!â€\\x9d He replied, â€œOK, I will come. But donâ€™t die just yet.â€\\x9d We filmed the visit of Ali, who was accompanied by his then wife, Veronica, and a posse of friends and guards. Bangladesh I Love You was cut and edited in London and distributed by Lord Grade. Years later I wanted to make India I Love You to repeat the same formula with Ali when Indira Gandhi was the prime minister. All went well and filming was on schedule, but then international politics scuppered the film. We were in Madras (now Chennai) when a call came to my room. The voice, in a southern US accent, said: â€œI wanna speak to Ali.â€\\x9d I said: â€œAli is resting in his suite. Itâ€™s hot in south India.â€\\x9d The voice said: â€œWell get to him. Tell him itâ€™s Jimmy Carter from the White House who wants to talk to him now.â€\\x9d I transferred the call to Aliâ€™s suite and rushed to his floor. When I got there, Ali was standing to attention and saying: â€œYes Mr President, I will drop everything here.â€\\x9d Carter had asked Ali to fly to all the Islamic countries to request they pull out of the Moscow Olympics. An hour earlier the USSR had attacked Afghanistan. â€œMy president has ordered me,â€\\x9d he told me. â€œI must obey him.â€\\x9d Within three hours an aircraft arrived with US commandos on board. It flew off with Ali and his family. My film had perished.',\n",
              "  \"Pentagon admits it is 'looking to accelerate' cyber-attacks against Isis The Pentagon has acknowledged using its storehouse of new digital weapons to attack Islamic State communications networks, the first time that the US military has acknowledged doing so during an active war. Operators from the US Cyber Command, the young military command twinned to the National Security Agency, have launched assaults on nodes, overloading them with data, US defense chief Ashton Carter said on Monday. Carter told reporters the US was â€œlooking to accelerateâ€\\x9d cyber-strikes he likened to the traditional disruption of enemy command networks. The US cyber-attacks, which Carter said complemented familiar methods of signal jamming over radio frequencies, seek to instill a loss of confidence in the security and efficacy of internal Isis communications. Analysts who have long tracked the development and incorporation of digital weapons into the US military arsenal considered Carterâ€™s acknowledgment to be a milestone. â€œThe cyberwar seal has been broken in publicâ€\\x9d, said Peter W Singer of the New America Foundation. Thus far, the US has only acknowledged using digital weaponry in vague terms. Secrecy has surrounded their use, as the US cyber arsenal has seen operation as part of covert intelligence activities, rather than as a component of an ongoing war. Stuxnet, a worm that disrupts the functions of industrial centrifuges used in Iranâ€™s nuclear program, is widely believed to have been jointly developed by the US and Israel. The Obama administration has never formally acknowledged possessing a broader panoply of cyber weapons aimed at the Iranian nuclear program, known as Olympic Games. The New York Times recently reported that the US prepared a campaign for their use, Nitro Zeus, in the event that a diplomatic effort to halt the program broke down. But the administration considered those online efforts alternatives to warfare. Against Isis, the US is using cyber weapons as a method of warfare alongside the airstrikes, indigenous force training and special operations raids that characterize the US campaign in Iraq and Syria. With Olympic Games, unlike Stuxnet, Singer said, â€œthe US military is making clear that it can and will carry out offensive cyber operations. Everyone knew we could do it and Isis as the target makes this less controversial, but it is still a big line to cross.â€\\x9d Carter and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Marine Gen Joseph Dunford, declined to speak about the US cyber campaign in detail, but said it contributed the broader objectives of isolating the Isis capital of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. â€œConceptually, thatâ€™s the same thing weâ€™re trying to do in the cyberworld,â€\\x9d Dunford said Monday. Both senior officials acknowledged a potential loss of intelligence coming from the assaults on Isis networks the US monitors, but expressed hope that they would press Isis fighters into using more interceptable modes of communications. In addition to overloading or defacing Isisâ€™s web presence, known as a denial of service attack, and aiming to prevent the uploading or distribution of propaganda, particularly on social media, it is likely that the US Cyber Command is â€œmapping the people behind networks, their connections and physical locations and then feeding that into targeting on the kinetic side â€“ injecting false info to create uncertaintyâ€\\x9d, Singer said.\",\n",
              "  'The EU referendum is already following the Scottish playbook, Project Fear 2.0 Letâ€™s call it Project Fear 2.0. As the remain campaign moves up the gears, it has the considerable advantage of a road-tested playbook. In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish referendum, the UK government and, in particular, the Treasury set about frightening the voting natives with a series of high-profile warnings of the apocalypse that would surely follow any breakup of the union. In an unprecedented breach of civil service protocol, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, published his private advice to the chancellor. It homed in on what would become a key issue â€“ the refusal to allow an independent Scotland to continue using sterling. His letter to George Osborne concluded: â€œI would advise you against entering a currency union with an independent Scotland. There is no evidence that adequate proposals or policy changes â€¦ could be devised, agreed and implemented by both governments in the foreseeable future.â€\\x9d Not unexpectedly it caused a massive row, and his subsequent rationale was nothing if not revealing: â€œMy view in this case â€“ and itâ€™s a very exceptional case â€“ is that if publishing advice could strengthen the credibility of the governmentâ€™s position, then it was my duty to do it.â€\\x9d Fast forward to cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywoodâ€™s letter to permanent secretaries published this week advising them that civil service resources â€œmust only be used in the referendum campaign if they support the governmentâ€™s official stance in support of Britainâ€™s membership of the EUâ€\\x9d. The same missive warned special advisers attached to Brexit ministers that they should campaign only in their own time and at their own expense. Should they be found to be doing so in the course of their normal working day their salary would be adjusted accordingly. This weekâ€™s letter from a number of business leaders also has a useful precedent. In 2014, the bosses of major supermarkets and retailers were summoned to No 10 and encouraged to make public their fears for trade if an artificial border were set up between Scotland and England. The argument over how the British economy would suffer from â€œScexitâ€\\x9d was reinforced by RBS and Lloyds, among other banks, admitting to contingency plans to move their main offices to London. In case nobody was paying sufficient attention, the Treasury helpfully put out a press release. Memorably, the Treasury was also able to tell the BBCâ€™s political editor about RBSâ€™s game plan before the bankâ€™s relevant evening board meeting had concluded. Truly, the Treasuryâ€™s night vision and predictive powers are a thing of wonder. The Ministry of Defence has form too. As the no camp continued to slip in the polls, it was able to assure the nation that were a Scottish government to insist on Trident removal from the Clyde, neither Devonport nor any other English base would be suitably secure to house the Vanguard submarine fleet. So: less strong, less secure, more dangerous in a dangerous world. Has a familiar ring? By that stage the Scottish public were bracing themselves for news from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that the latter would sadly not be in a position to aid the Scottish Department of Agriculture and Fisheries when the upcoming locust plague threatened to relocate north of Berwick. Somewhat to the bemusement of that same tartan electorate, the leave campaign is wasting no opportunity to lecture its audience on the joys of self-determination. All those chaps who made cross-border forays into the 2014 referendum campaign to advise Scots that separatism was a dangerous â€“ yes, folks â€“ â€œleap in the darkâ€\\x9d, have binned that rather negative script and joyously embraced â€œthe capacity to make our own laws and decisionsâ€\\x9d. This is a particularly rich intervention from Londonâ€™s own blond bombshell, Boris Johnson, given the time he previously devoted to the importance of getting the whingeing Jocks to realise how lucky they were to be joined at the hip to metropolitan brain power, enterprise and major trading partners. But there is a whopping irony in all of this, and I doubt first minister Nicola Sturgeon finds it of the delicious variety. Historically, Scotland has always been more enthusiastic about Europe â€“ and still is. The polls for staying in regularly top 60%. The first minister has said that she will campaign vigorously for remaining in the EU, even if, like Jeremy Corbyn, her reasoning is predicated more on social and employment policies. So imagine the joy with which she, and most of the erstwhile yes campaigners, view the prospect of spending the next few months metaphorically in bed with Team Dave, while Borisâ€™s battalions urge voters to rise up and be a nation again. Honestly, you couldnâ€™t make it up.',\n",
              "  'Viral video: David Bowie, Alan Rickman, Adele, Golden Globes This week was dominated by the untimely deaths of two stars â€“ David Bowie and Alan Rickman. Both died at the age of 69, and both leave bodies of work that have been widely shared by their fans in the wake of their passing. Bowieâ€™s death was marked by many fans with an animated GIF rather than a video â€“ illustrator Helen Greenâ€™s striking drawings of the starâ€™s hairstyles throughout his career. Created to mark the Thin White Dukeâ€™s 68th birthday, it became one of the defining image of his death almost exactly a year later. In terms of video, itâ€™s impossible to give more than a taste here of Bowieâ€™s legacy in video, from Space Oddity to Ashes to Ashes to the singles from his latest album Blackstar. Bowie videos broke Adeleâ€™s record for the most views in a day on video platform Vevo, with his clips watched 51 million times on Monday. They were led by Bowieâ€™s most recent single, Lazarus, which features the opening line â€œLook up here, Iâ€™m in heaven / Iâ€™ve got scars that canâ€™t be seenâ€\\x9d. The lyrics took on a new resonance in the wake of the starâ€™s death, while fans scoured the video for references to his career, with some pointing to the skull on the desk (also in the Blackstar promo) and others highlighting that his clothes as he gets into the wardrobe are was identical to an outfit from 1976â€™s The Man Who Fell To Earth. Arguably one of the best Bowie videos is also the simplest â€“ Mick Rockâ€™s 1971 promo for Life on Mars? Featuring the star with striking red hair and piercing blue eyeshadow, it allows his personality to shine straight through the screen. Fellow musiciansâ€™ tributes to Bowie also made waves this week, with Madonna singing Rebel Rebel live in Houston and Elton John performing a piano piece echoing Space Odyssey. Amid all the gloom surrounding Bowieâ€™s death, itâ€™s easy to forget that the singer had a great sense of humour and did a string of turns sending up his cool image, from a voice role in a Spongebob Squarepants movie to a cameo on Zoolander. Perhaps the best is his appearance in Ricky Gervaisâ€™s Extras, with the star mocking the comic as a â€œchubby little loser, national jokeâ€\\x9d. Hereâ€™s an interview in which Bowie gives a deadpan account of his cameo. Although he did his share of serious theatical roles, Rickman was also notable for his comic appearances. As well as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films, he played the deliciously evil Hans Gruber in Die Hard. But perhaps his most memorable comic appearance was as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, where he pretty much steals the show fom Kevin Kostner with lines such as â€œLocksley! Iâ€™ll cut your heart out with a spoon!â€\\x9d Another standout moment was Rickmanâ€™s voiceover for Marvin the robot in The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide To The Galaxy, a masterclass in comic misery. His line â€œI think you ought to know Iâ€™m feeling very depressedâ€\\x9d echoed the feelings of many fans this week. Sundayâ€™s Golden Globes provided plenty of headlines this week, from Ricky Gervais ribbing the audience to Jennifer Lawrence telling off a reporter for looking at his phone during a press conference. But the highlight for many viewers was the glimpse of Leonardo DiCaprioâ€™s face as Lady Gaga brushed past on her way to pick up best actress for American Horror Story. His look of horror as the singer appears next to him is a million miles away from a Poker Face. Finally, the weekâ€™s most-shared video was Adeleâ€™s appearnce in James Cordenâ€™s Carpool Karaoke slot. Hearing the Hello star belt out the Spice Girlsâ€™ Wannabe is a highlight while her rap of Nicki Minajâ€™s Monster shows her talents reach beyond singing. 1) Adele Carpool Karaoke Sheâ€™s no wannabe 2) Leonardo DiCaprio vs Lady Gaga at the Golden Globes Shady behaviour 3) Saoirse Ronan Tries To Teach Stephen Colbert An Irish Accent Brooklyn brogue 4) EL VY & Stay Human Pay Tribute To David Bowie Letâ€™s dance with Stephen Colbert 5) Snowboarding An Empty Water Park Liquid moves 6) The Path on Hulu Teaser Trailer #1 (Official) New show from Breaking Badâ€™s Aaron Paul looks like cult viewing 7) Mulder, Scully and Jimmy Kimmel in The X-Files David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson embrace their return 8) 1 Day Old Sea Otter Trying to Sleep on Mom Cute overload 9) â€œTonight Show Celebrity Photobombâ€\\x9d with Jimmy Fallon and Sesame Street Look out for the â€œdouble cookieâ€\\x9d 10) Dog Knocks Another Dog Off of Couch Canine catastrophe',\n",

              "  'Wheelchairs have come a long way â€“ shame the NHS hasnâ€™t Gone are the days of clunky wheelchairs seemingly designed to hinder as much as to help â€“ at least for some. The latest promising development in the disability world comes from ex-Royal Marine Phillip Eaglesham, who was almost paralysed after contracting Q-fever on his last day in Afghanistan. When he began to lose strength, he used a Segway to get around and realised how helpful its versatility was. Now that he cannot use one, he has designed a new chair that copies some of the Segwayâ€™s features to allow wheelchair users to manoeuvre easily and, most importantly, raise themselves up to eye-level and have a decent conversation. My electric wheelchair is nowhere near as cool, but I can raise myself to just below standard eye-height. Itâ€™s hard to express how much this helps me have a normal life. Yes, of course it means that I can reach things on shelves and whatnot. But it also means I can do typical twentysomething activities such as introduce myself in a noisy environment or even, God forbid, sit at a bar. Without it, crowded places such as clubs become a nightmare, as does meeting new people. People are conditioned to notice others of a standard height and to patronise those whose heads are more at the level of a childâ€™s. My cerebral palsy makes it hard to project my voice, so being able to raise myself up allows me to engage with others as an equal. Yet the relevant authorities do not believe that features such as this are important. The NHS wheelchair service will only provide wheelchairs that meet medical needs; independence and social needs are ignored. The result is that decent wheelchairs, and by extension a decent quality of life, are reserved for those who can afford them â€“ and they can be prohibitively expensive. The new design is projected to cost a tidy Â£10,000. My friend Anna has spinal muscular atrophy, and relies on a highly specialised chair that can transform into a standing frame to help retain her muscle strength. Last year her old chair malfunctioned â€“ throwing her to the ground, leaving her with sprained ankles. Since then, while she fundraises for a replacement, she has been given a manual chair that she cannot move at all, and a borrowed powerchair that does not meet her needs. The model she needs, that will allow her to go about her daily life, costs Â£24,000. The NHS provided a voucher for Â£1,295, the cost of its standard chair. This barely makes a dent in the total sum needed. Over a year later, Anna is finally ready to order the right chair. Others may not be able to work so hard to raise money. For some disabled people, our wheelchairs are the substitute for our legs. Yet the way we treat disabled people is like asking someone who has broken both legs to pay for the operation to fix the second break â€“ and this from a government that aims to get more of us in work, while remaining indifferent to helping us do so. Inventions like Eagleshamâ€™s have the potential to make disabled peopleâ€™s lives much better. But with so many people unable to access a chair that is even remotely suited to their lives and needs, progress seems far off. As technology improves, the possibility of better equipment grows, but so does the gap between those who can and cannot afford it. Only the state can level this cruel inequality.',\n",

Lee received an honorary Oscar at a ceremony in November last year for his work as a film-maker. But writing on Instagram on Monday, the director of Do the Right Thing and Chi-Raq said he had decided not to attend the main event. â€œI would like to thank president Cheryl Boone Isaacs and the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for awarding me an honorary Oscar this past November,â€\\x9d he wrote. â€œI am most appreciative. However my wife, Mrs Tonya Lewis Lee and I will not be attending the Oscar ceremony this coming February.

And letâ€™s not even get into the other branches. 40 white actors in 2 years and no flava at all. We canâ€™t act?! WTF!!â€\\x9d It was not clear if Lee was responding to Jada Pinkett Smithâ€™s tweeted suggestion on Saturday that a boycott of the Oscars by ethnic minority actors might be justified. â€œAt the Oscars â€¦ people of colour are always welcomed to give out awards â€¦ even entertain,â€\\x9d Pinkett Smith wrote on Twitter. â€œBut we are rarely recognised for our artistic accomplishments. Should people of colour refrain from participating all together? People can only treat us in the way in which we allow. With much respect in the midst of deep disappointment.â€\\x9d Leeâ€™s Chi-Raq, a critically acclaimed musical comedy about a woman who goes on sex strike to protest against black-on-black gun violence in Chicago, failed to make an impact on the current awards season despite an Oscars push by the filmâ€™s studio, Amazon. Pinkett Smith is married to the actor Will Smith, who missed out on a best actor nomination for his role in the film Concussion. Other absentees from Thursdayâ€™s list of Oscar nominees included British actor Idris Elba, who was widely expected to challenge for the best supporting actor prize following his Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild-nominated turn as an African warlord in the Netflix drama Beasts of No Nation, Benicio del Toro for Sicario and Michael B Jordan for Creed. Meanwhile, Straight Outta Compton producer Will Packer described the 2016 list of Oscar nominees as â€œembarrassingâ€\\x9d in a lengthy Facebook post after the filmâ€™s sole nomination was handed to its white screenwriters, Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff.

              "  'HMV moves ahead of Tesco as second biggest entertainment retailer HMV has reclaimed is position as the second biggest entertainment retailer in the UK as high street chains enjoy a revival against their online competitors. HMV recorded a 2% year-on-year rise in sales of music, DVDs and games over the last quarter, giving it a market share of 16.9%, ahead of Tescoâ€™s 16.1%. The figures represent HMVâ€™s best performance since it collapsed into administration more than three years ago. It was eventually rescued by Hilco, the investment firm. Overall, sales of entertainment products in bricks-and-mortar shops fell by 2% during the 12 weeks to 10 April, according to Kantar Worldpanel. However, online retailers suffered a much larger decline, with sales down by 12%. Amazon, the countryâ€™s biggest entertainment retailer, saw its sales fall by 0.6% year-on-year, reducing its market share from 22.6% to 22%. Analysts said that high street entertainment stores were being underpinned by music and video games. One-in-four customers still only buy CDs, while 77% of video games were bought at shops during the quarter. Tesco and Game achieved their biggest share of video game sales for five years. This helped high street stores and supermarkets to claim 69.8% of spending on all physical entertainment products, up from 67.5% a year ago. Fiona Keenan, strategic insight director at Kantar, said: â€œDespite recent high profile casualties for high street fashion retailers the performance of bricks and mortar entertainment stores has demonstrated the strong appeal this channel still holds for consumers. â€œSome 14% of the population now has a music subscription service and paid-for Spotify subscriptions are growing at 25%. Yet the CD is still the most popular way to consume music content. â€œSuch a strong performance from HMV has not been seen since it entered administration in 2013. HMV has really focused on creating an in-store environment that stimulates and excites consumers like it did in its heyday. â€œThis focus is clearly reflected in the fact that over half of its sales this quarter came from customers who hadnâ€™t planned to make a purchase â€“ significantly higher than the market average of 38%.â€\\x9d Across the industry, music sales dipped by 1% during the period, with DVDs down 6% and games down 8%. Popular products include David Bowieâ€™s albums Blackstar and Best of Bowie following his death in January, as well as the compilation Now Thatâ€™s What I Call Music! 93 and Adeleâ€™s 25. The best-selling DVD during the period was Spectre, the latest James Bond film, which has sold more than 1.7m copies since it went on sale in February.',\n",
              "  \"Even the pro-Remain newspapers are sceptical about Osborne's 'dossier' Does anyone really believe George Osborneâ€™s warning that leaving the European Union would plunge Britain into instant recession, result in 820,000 job losses and force up the price of foreign holidays? Even a leading Remain campaigner, Scotlandâ€™s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, thought such â€œfear-basedâ€\\x9d predictions were insulting to the intelligence of the electorate. Sturgeonâ€™s statement was headlined in the , the Times and Metro. It was noticeable that the pro-European Union Daily Mirror appeared sceptical enough to give Boris Johnsonâ€™s reaction - â€œThese types of prophecies are not credibleâ€\\x9d - top billing in its news report. And the Europhile Independent ran a piece that also questioned the claims: â€œFive problems with the Treasuryâ€™s economic analysis of the impact of Brexitâ€\\x9d. The pro-Brexit Daily Telegraph lamented that a â€œproudly impartial civil serviceâ€\\x9d had produced a report that â€œcould in no way be called open-minded.â€\\x9d On its news page, the paper reported that the prime minister was facing threats of cabinet resignations and it quoted Johnson, who accused Cameron and Osborne of â€œscaremongeringâ€\\x9d. It was not alone in revealing the depth of the split within the Conservative party. The Daily Mailâ€™s splash, â€œKnives out for Cameronâ€\\x9d, reported that â€œdozens of Tory MPs are threatening to topple David Cameronâ€\\x9d following â€œthe latest Brexit â€˜dodgyâ€™ dossier row.â€\\x9d It said unnamed backbenchers were predicting a vote of no-confidence in their leader after the referendum vote. But it also quoted several named critics: former defence secretary Liam Fox, Commons leader Chris Grayling, former chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont, plus backbencher Bernard Jenkin. It also mentioned the tweet by the Tory MP for Yeovil, Marcus Fysh, who called the Treasury analysis â€œspecious bollocksâ€\\x9d (though the paper used asterisks). That tweet was seized on by the Sun, which ran a poster-style front page headlined â€œNever mind the b*!!**ksâ€\\x9d. It said a â€œfurious Tory backlashâ€\\x9d over Osborneâ€™s â€œdoomsday dossier on Brexitâ€\\x9d had taken the party to â€œbreaking pointâ€\\x9d, with two ministers threatening to quit. But it was the Telegraph that carried news giving the greatest heart to the Remain campaign by leading its front page with the results of its opinion poll. The ORB survey put Remain on 55% and Leave on 42% among voters who say they will vote. Among all voters, the Remain campaign was favoured by 58%. According to the poll, there has been â€œa collapse in support for Brexitâ€\\x9d, with older voters, Conservative supporters and men moving into the Remain camp. The paper carried an analysis of the poll result by Lynton Crosby, the Tory party strategist, in which he wrote that one of the largest shifts in voting intention has occurred among Tory voters. In March, 60% were intending to vote Leave compared with 34% for Remain. Now the figures have moved to 57% as against 40%. Crosby concluded: â€œThe Remain campaign should view these advancements as affirmation that the focus and messaging of its campaign is working. If Leave is to regain any lost ground, it must start paying attention to the numbers and capitalise on its strengths - its steadfast lead on immigration and the way uncontrolled immigration is seen more widely as a symbol of the countryâ€™s loss of control of its sovereignty to Europe, coupled with the enthusiasm of their base.â€\\x9d The Sunâ€™s lengthy leading article preferred to point to the decision by Cameronâ€™s former aide, Steve Hilton, to back Brexit after saying â€œmembership of the EU makes Britain literally ungovernable.â€\\x9d It poured scorn on Osborne: â€œEither the chancellorâ€™s forecasts are credible, in which case holding the vote is a monstrous act of negligence, or he doesnâ€™t believe them himself and is in the business of whipping up hysteria. No prizes for guessing which we go for.â€\\x9d For the Sun, â€œRemainâ€™s tactics have been a dark mix of fiction and fear plus a vicious smearing of their opponents.â€\\x9d I think that final sentence would win an award for irony.\",\n",
              "  'Sampha review â€“ a polite, pulsing performance cuts to the core Samphaâ€™s always been about the voice. Diehard fans may have been following the 27-year-old producer and musicianâ€™s work since his 2010 Sundanza EP, but most listeners will know him more for the husky vocals slathered like a soothing paste on to other peopleâ€™s singles. Whether adding depth to Jessie Wareâ€™s 2013 single Valentine, landing the emotive suckerpunch on Drake co-write Too Much or lending longtime collaborator SBTRKTâ€™s clubland tracks their hooks, Samphaâ€™s distinctive vocal texture has become a brand of its own. In between songs tonight, that voice is initially polite. After kicking off with forthcoming debut album opener Plastic 100Â°C, he thanks the crowd for being here and gives a quick shout out to friends and family â€“ really, he sounds more like a respectful birthday party host than headliner of a sold-out show on home turf. But once he and his band launch into their thumping, electrofunk rendition of Under, you remember just why heâ€™s earned enough of a reputation to pack out a venue before heâ€™s even released a solo album. He has a beautiful knack for combining what was originally seen as a â€œnu-soulâ€\\x9d sensibility with deeply personal lyrical themes that cut right into the wobbly core of our vulnerabilities. The show undulates in energy, pulsing while he belts out Blood on Me, then pulling back to vocals-and-keys simplicity on Canâ€™t Get Close and crowd-pleaser Too Much. And whenever the band sound momentarily shaky, Sampha whips out the trick that keeps it all together: that trembling, creaking, howling voice.',\n",
              "  \"Malcolm Middleton's playlist: Avicii, Ellie Goulding and more Betty Boo â€“ Hangover A classic 90s pop song that I always return to. Her second album was pretty diverse and dark, I think this shouldâ€™ve been the start of her career as a performer, not the end. She did continue writing for other folk, mind you. Avicii â€“ Wake Me Up I hated this song for ages before lightening up and listening to it properly. It gets me every time, and I wish I could write songs like this, but with more personal lyrics. I guess Iâ€™ve tried to on Summer of â€˜13, but Iâ€™m not quite there yet. My song Big Black Hole couldhave been an attempt at a massive pop hit if Iâ€™d taken Gordon [Anderson]â€™s advice and used the hook more. Iâ€™m too obtuse though. Tegan and Sara â€“ I Was a Fool This also influenced Big Black Hole. I wanted some kind of pure, pristine, piano-led pop hook. I wrote the motif to fit a song I already had and then sourced some R&B presets â€“ voila. Iâ€™m not a huge fan of these guys as, like always when I find a song I love by an artist, it turned out to be a one-off. Ellie Goulding â€“ Burn When my son was born, weâ€™d watch lots of early-morning music TV. This was always on. Not a great song, but the ideas seeped into what I was writing at the time. So yeah, Iâ€™m with the times (2013). The Good Natured â€“ Wolves I donâ€™t think this band exists anymore, or even released an album. But I love a lot of their early songs: no-nonsense pop, massive chorus, sense of urgency. Theyâ€™ve been a big influence on me recently as they have such a stripped-back way of making great songs. It must be a sign of good songwriting.\",\n",
              "  'Trump campaign reportedly vetting Christie, Gingrich as potential running mates â€“ as it happened Donald Trumpâ€™s first town hall event featured him interrupting his first questioner, a self-described â€œmanufacturing guy,â€\\x9d three times, although the questioners got the last laugh: â€œNumber one: Iâ€™m opposed to the murder of unborn babies being legal,â€\\x9d a man asked (said?). â€œNumber two: Iâ€™m opposed to our wasting our military in the Middle East on behalf of Zionist Israel.â€\\x9d Trump, slightly flummoxed at the two issues being brought up at an address putatively about US trade policy, responded to the second comment. â€œLemme just tell you that Israel is a very, very important ally of the United States, and we are going to protect them 100%. One-hundred percent,â€\\x9d Trump said. â€œItâ€™s our true friend over there, and we are going to protect Israel 100%.â€\\x9d He also suggested that a passing plane might be a Mexican fighter jet: On the heels of (relatively less-well respected) Rasmussenâ€™s survey depicting Trump up four points, (relatively well respected) Reuters/Ipsos releases the latest edition of their weekly tracking poll and it has Clinton up 10 points, 42-32. Whom to believe? The averages, weâ€™re taught. RealClearPolitics hasnâ€™t incorporated the latest Reuters yet and has Clinton up 4.9 points. HuffPost Pollster has baked in both Rasmussen and Reuters and has Clinton up 6.9 points. FranÃ§ois Hollande of France, he of the 17% approval rating, told Les Echos that a Donald Trump presidency would be dangerous and â€œthe best service the Democrats could render would be to get Hillary Clinton elected.â€\\x9d Sheâ€™ll want to get this right into her swing-state ad buys. Vermont senator and perpetual presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been granted his second 45-day extension to file personal financial disclosure reports, putting the latest deadline for Sanders to file the forms well after the conclusion of next monthâ€™s Democratic National Convention. The request, filed with the Federal Election Commission today by the campaignâ€™s legal counsel, cites Sandersâ€™ â€œ current campaign schedule & officeholder dutiesâ€\\x9d as the reason for the delay in filing the required report, which would provide limited detail of the senatorâ€™s assets and liabilities. Vice president Joe Biden told NPR News that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders plans on endorsing Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential bid: Donald Trump will be speaking on Sean Hannityâ€™s show in ten minutes: Speaking at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, earlier this afternoon, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump jokes about Mexico attacking the US. Pointing out a plane flying overheard, he said: â€œThat could be a Mexican plane up there.â€\\x9d Trump has consistently criticised Mexico during his campaign and has pledged to build a wall between the two nations should he be elected president. Donald Trump may not be a fan of journalism, but heâ€™s apparently a big subscriber to blind-item gossip columns. In a radio interview with Bostonâ€™s Howie Carr, Trump was asked about rumors that MSNBCâ€™s Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski are romantically involved. Trumpâ€™s response: Well, I havenâ€™t seen that, but I, I heard it was in the New York Post. And the New York Post gets it right. So, they even endorsed me. So when I got an endorsement from the New York Post, I like them even more. When I saw that, it was - people are talking about that. Thatâ€™s good, I hope theyâ€™re happy. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was once a darling of the morning show, but had a falling-out after Brzezinski apparently sided with House speaker Paul Ryan when he initially refused to endorse Trumpâ€™s candidacy. Video explainer: Transgender people can now openly serve in the US military, defense secretary Ash Carter announced this afternoon. The historic change in military policy means that transgender individuals can no longer be separated, discharged, or denied re-enlistment or continuation of service just for being transgender. Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign is honing in on potential running mates for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The two men reportedly at the top of the list: Former House speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey governor Chris Christie. According to the Washington Post, the two experienced politicians are joined on the short list by a half-dozen or so potential running mates, but both Gingrich and Christie have been asked to submit documents to the vetting committee, and with less than three weeks before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland begins. The list is rounded by by Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, Tennesee senator Bob Corker and Indiana governor Mike Pence. Both Gingrich and Christie present their bonuses and complications to a potential Trump ticket. Gingrich, a former speaker of the house, would add government experience and a long history in Washington to Trumpâ€™s inexperienced candidacy, but would undercut his outsider message, and, like Trump, is on his third marriage. Christie, known as a pugnacious debater, would fulfill the traditional â€œattack dogâ€\\x9d role as a running mate, but his tenure as governor of New Jersey has been checkered by controversies. Donald Trump has made his support for Brexit a standard stump line in the past week, but his voters have been left with a less than clear idea of the implications of the UKâ€™s vote to leave the European Union. Trump, who was one of the few international political figures to actively support those seeking to leave the European Union, touted the referendum decision as a â€œgreat victoryâ€\\x9d in a press conference in Scotland the morning after the result. He has since bragged that â€œCrooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrongâ€\\x9d and praised the vote as a decision by British voters to â€œtake back control of their economy, politics and bordersâ€\\x9d in a major speech on trade policy Tuesday afternoon. He has even insisted he â€œstood with the people on the referendum while his Democratic rival â€œas always stood with the elitesâ€\\x9d. Trump has gone on to tie the vote to his own presidential campaign, saying: â€œNow itâ€™s time for the American people to take back their future.â€\\x9d Many of his supporters at a rally in a college gymnasium in Ohio shared Trumpâ€™s support for Brexit, seeing the vote as a step towards Great Britain being liberated from Europe. Cathy Brown, a Trump voter who drove seven hours from outside Richmond, Virginia, though British voters â€œmade a good choice to become freeâ€\\x9d. She celebrated the fact that the vote â€œmeans that people can make their own choices they can decide on a lot of things that were decided for themâ€\\x9d. In her opinion, British voters will now â€œhave sayâ€\\x9d on issues like â€œtrade and open bordersâ€\\x9d. Brown also dismissed concerns about the impact the deal will have on the US because now â€œweâ€™ll be able to work out a deal thatâ€™s better to put us to work and get our people goingâ€\\x9d with the UK. A new poll shows presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by double digits in a key swing state - and the gap remained much the same when third-party candidates were included in the survey. According to the latest Loras College poll, 48% of Iowa voters say that they support Clinton, compared to 34% who support Trump in a head-to-head matchup between the two candidates, a 14-point lead for the former secretary of state. When Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein were added to the survey, Clintonâ€™s lead narrowed slightly, 44% to Trumpâ€™s 31%, with Johnson winning 6% of Hawkeye State voters and Stein winning 2%. A full 9% of Republicans surveyed told Loras that they would definitely or probably vote for Johnson instead of Trump, a massive outpouring of support for a third-party candidate. â€œFor Trump to win Iowa in November, he is going to need to attract those potential Johnson voters and the undecided,â€\\x9d said Christopher Budzisz, the pollâ€™s director, in a statement. â€œWhile Clinton doesnâ€™t appear right now as vulnerable to a loss of votes to a third party candidate, she does face her own potential pitfalls.â€\\x9d In March, Donald Trump called NATO â€œobsoleteâ€\\x9d and said it would â€œhave to be readjusted to take care of terrorism.â€\\x9d Vice president Joe Biden has told NPR News that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders plans on endorsing Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential bid: Al Goreâ€™s daughter was among 23 people arrested during a protest of a pipeline under construction. The arrests happened yesterday at the site of Spectra Energyâ€™s West Roxbury Lateral pipeline in Boston. Karenna Gore was among demonstrators who tried to block construction activity on the site by lying in a trench dug for the pipeline and refusing to move until firefighters removed them, said protest group Resist the Pipeline & Stop the West Roxbury Lateral. The group opposes the pipeline because of safety and climate change concerns. Video: This afternoon, the US military ended its ban on openly transgender service members, in a speech given by US defense secretary Ash Carter. Carter said effective immediately, US service members would be able to serve openly and could not be discharged simply based on gender identity. Hereâ€™s video of Donald Trump being questioned about Muslims working at airport security: Trumpâ€™s response: â€œWe are looking at that. Weâ€™re looking at a lot of things.â€\\x9d Donald Trump, on a â€œMexican planeâ€\\x9d getting â€œready to attackâ€\\x9d: A woman asks Donald Trump to get rid of Transportation Security Administration workers with â€œheeby jobbiesâ€\\x9d at US airports, an apparent reference to hijabs, veils that cover the hair and neck of observant Muslim women. Trump dodges, moving to airport security overall, and the event is over. The fourth question - well, technically the third question, since Trump never allowed the first person to ask a question - comes from a man who says â€œwe have something in common: respect for human life.â€\\x9d Trump nods reticently. â€œNumber one: Iâ€™m opposed to the murder of unborn babies being legal,â€\\x9d the man says. â€œNumber two: Iâ€™m opposed to our wasting our military in the Middle East on behalf of Zionist Israel.â€\\x9d Trump, slightly flummoxed at the two issues being brought up at an address putatively about US trade policy, responds to the second comment. â€œLemme just tell you that Israel is a very, very important ally of the United States, and we are going to protect them 100%. One-hundred percent,â€\\x9d Trump says. â€œItâ€™s our true friend over there, and we are going to protect Israel 100%.â€\\x9d â€œAs to number one, we are all with you,â€\\x9d Trump says succinctly. â€œWow, that was nasty! Are we all with Israel? Man!â€\\x9d Trump says, shaking his head, before taking another question. A questioner asks Donald Trump about the likely â€œcorporate backlashâ€\\x9d of international companies who wonâ€™t be too keen on cutting into their profits by manufacturing and consuming within the United States. â€œYouâ€™re gonna have a backlash where maybe people are gonna move from New Hampshire, but theyâ€™re gonna move to another state. Plenty to choose from!â€\\x9d Trump says. â€œMy tax plan is cutting business taxes way down, and cutting taxes for middle income and everybody way down.â€\\x9d â€œWeâ€™re gonna simplify our tax code, number one, and weâ€™re gonna cut our taxes. Weâ€™re at the highest tax, weâ€™re just about he highest taxes in the world,â€\\x9d Trump says, saying that â€œweâ€™re gonna make corporations wanna come back.â€\\x9d â€œCompanies are actually leaving the United States and going to other countries to pick up their money cause they canâ€™t get their money in. And that money could be used to rebuild the United States!â€\\x9d Trump says. â€œWeâ€™re gonna bring our money into the United States - trillions of dollars, we bring it into the United States!â€\\x9d â€œWe will do things that are going to be so miraculous - and itâ€™ll be fast! You know, it wonâ€™t take a long period of time.â€\\x9d Donald Trumpâ€™s first town hall event features him interrupting his first questioner, a self-described â€œmanufacturing guy,â€\\x9d three times. Still no idea what his question was, although it seemed to be headed towards creating a culture of domestic consumption of goods. Another questioner, an impassioned man whose company manufactured police badges before he lost business to China, calls current trade issues â€œunfair.â€\\x9d â€œWhat are you gonna do for us?â€\\x9d â€œWe donâ€™t play the game they play the game - they play the game to win, we play the game to survive,â€\\x9d Trump says of China. â€œWeâ€™re gonna start playing the game to win. So just hang in there - I know itâ€™s not easy, but just hang in their, man.â€\\x9d Donald Trump, speaking at a shuttered factory in Manchester, New Hampshire, emphasizes the importance of walking away from a deal as a negotiating tactic, citing the Iranian nuclear agreement as an example of a situation where his school of negotiation is superior to that of Secretary of State John Kerry. â€œHe never walked - he lost every single point,â€\\x9d Trump says. â€œWe shoulda said no way, we shoulda left the room, we shoulda said weâ€™re doubling your sanctions, and they would have been back on the television saying â€˜please come back!â€™â€\\x9d â€œI want great deals for this country,â€\\x9d Donald Trump says in Manchester, New Hampshire. â€œHereâ€™s my stance on trading: I wanna make great deals for the United States. Call it fair trade, call it free trade, call it whatever you want.â€\\x9d â€œIf companies leaveâ€¦ thereâ€™s going to be consequences,â€\\x9d Trump continues. â€œTheyâ€™re not gonna make their air conditioners in Mexico, send â€™em into the United Statesâ€¦ and thereâ€™s no consequence. Well, now thereâ€™s a consequence. The consequence is now theyâ€™re going to pay a 35% tax.â€\\x9d â€œWeâ€™re either going to keep â€™em here, or theyâ€™re going to lose a hell of a lot of money,â€\\x9d Trump continues. â€œItâ€™s very simple. They wanna go to another country, they gotta pay a tax to get their stuff back to this county.â€\\x9d Donald Trump, speaking at a former Osram Sylvania manufacturing plant in Manchester New Hampshire, ties manufacturing woes to trade deals â€œpushed throughâ€\\x9d by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. â€œHillary Clinton pushed through the trade deal with South Korea that killed another 100,000 jobs, and she pushed it through,â€\\x9d Trump says. â€œWe protect them - we have 28,000 soldiers on the line between North and South. And what happens, what happens if thereâ€™s a war? We get involved.â€\\x9d â€œThey are an economic behemoth - and we protect them, and they donâ€™t reimburse us for what itâ€™s costing,â€\\x9d Trump says. (Military officials have protested the idea that returning soldiers to the US would be cheaper than keeping them abroad.) â€œWhen you have large numbers of unemployed bc workers, incomes go down across the country - just across the entire country. It just affects so much and so many other people, so many other lives and so many other businesses,â€\\x9d Trump continues. â€œOur whole standard of living goes down - we have workers for 18 years, they havenâ€™t received an increase.â€\\x9d â€œItâ€™s a much better system, the way it used to be,â€\\x9d Trump says, of domestic production of goods that cost the consumer more. â€œWeâ€™re better off if theyâ€™re not quite as cheap.â€\\x9d At the former Osram Sylvania plant in Manchester, New Hampshire, Donald Trump recalls other closed manufacturing operations in the region while reading statistics and names from a sheet of paper on his lecture. â€œPeople from Mexico took their jobs,â€\\x9d Trump says, of a closed Ethan Allen manufacturing plant. â€œRegional job losses have been fantastically poor, fantastically bad and disgraceful.â€\\x9d â€œItâ€™s just, itâ€™s not very hard to explain, itâ€™s not very hard to understand. What is very difficult is to figure out why people did this. Why? ... We have a $500 billion trade deficit with China, a massive trade deficit with Japan,â€\\x9d Trump says. â€œThey send us millions of cars, we send them beef. You oughta take a look at a chart sometime, take a look at the difference between what we send them and what they send us.â€\\x9d â€œThat could be a Mexican plane up there - they could be getting ready to attack,â€\\x9d Trump says, responding to an overhead plane. Donald Trump mentions the heroin crisis facing states like New Hampshire, shocked that hard drugs could be a problem in a state with beautiful natural features. â€œYou look at these beautiful trees and these beautiful streams and these beautiful lakes? This is not heroin country,â€\\x9d Trump says. Trump also promises the group that he will â€œtake a few questions,â€\\x9d making this, as far as we can recall, Trumpâ€™s first town hall-style meeting since he became the Republican partyâ€™s presumptive presidential nominee. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is holding an event - initially reported as an address on trade, but currently postulated as a â€œtown hallâ€\\x9d-style event - in Manchester, New Hampshire: The event, which is not open to the public, is sparsely attended. Donald Trump is running late to his campaign event in New Hampshire today, possibly because he is tweeting responses to an NBC News story that questions whether his campaign has filed the required documents to forgive the $50 million in loans he has personally provided to his presidential campaign: Vermont senator and perpetual presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been granted his second 45-day extension to file personal financial disclosure reports, putting the latest deadline for Sanders to file the forms well after the conclusion of next monthâ€™s Democratic National Convention. The request, filed with the Federal Election Commission today by the campaignâ€™s legal counsel, cites Sandersâ€™ â€œ current campaign schedule & officeholder dutiesâ€\\x9d as the reason for the delay in filing the required report, which would provide limited detail of the senatorâ€™s assets and liabilities. The new deadline for filing the disclosure reports is now in the middle of August. Fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, assigned to chair the New Hampshire delegation to the Republican convention, is at the Trump event in New Hampshire. Semper fidelis. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a race. If your only sources of information are the Drudge Report and Donald Trumpâ€™s Super Pac. Following an appearance Tuesday by president Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton in North Carolina, vice president Joe Biden will join Clinton Friday in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Anyone had enough Thursday poll numbers yet? But wait thereâ€™s more. RABA Research, which gets a B- in FiveThirtyEightâ€™s pollster ratings, gives Clinton a slight 41-38 lead in a new poll of voters in Ohio, which a Republican has never won the White House without winning. Ohio voters supporter governor John Kasichâ€™s decision not to endorse Trump by a margin of 48-39, the poll found. A last tidbit from Trumpâ€™s Mike Gallagher interview this morning. The candidate is talking about the difficulty he has had wringing endorsements out of some former rivals and other influential Republicans. â€œItâ€™s almost â€“ in some ways, like, Iâ€™m running against two parties,â€\\x9d Trump says. Again via CBS Newsâ€™ Sopan Deb: The Libertarian presidential ticket of former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld offers â€œa credible alternative to Clintrumpâ€\\x9d in a new video ad. They talk about their records as governor â€“ cutting taxes, building schools, balancing budgets, reducing unemployment â€“ and their successes as Republicans in blue states. â€œThey think like America thinks,â€\\x9d the ad says, billing the pair as â€œtwo of the most successful governors working together for a better America.â€\\x9d â€œThe difference between the two of us and the other candidates running for president is that weâ€™ve been there, and done that,â€\\x9d the pair takes turns saying. The tag line: â€œWhat say, America, you in?â€\\x9d (h/t: @bencjacobs) The Donald Trump campaign has changed its plans for his Manchester, New Hampshire, event this afternoon. Instead of a speech about trade closed to the public, Trump will hold a town hall open to the public, the campaign now says: More state polling, more iffy â€“ no letâ€™s just call it bad â€“ news for Trump. This time itâ€™s Loras College with Clinton up 14 points, 48-34, in Iowa. Trumpâ€™s unfavorability in the poll is 69%. Thereâ€™s actual election news, meanwhile, in Iowa, where the state supreme court has ruled against an an expansion of voting rights for convicted criminals, the Des Moines Register reports: The 4-3 decision upholds what critics say is one of the harshest felon disenfranchisement laws in the nation, and means the state will not see a significant shift in voter eligibility ahead of the 2016 election. Bernie Sanders has received an additional 45-day extension on filing a personal financial disclosure report. â€œThere is good cause for this extension due to Senator Sandersâ€™ current campaign schedule and officeholder duties,â€\\x9d his lawyer writes: Asked about the impromptu (?) Bill Clinton-Loretta Lynch meeting, White House press secretary Josh Earnest says Lynchâ€™s work speaks for itself, the New York Times reports: New state-level polling by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner research points up potential flaws in Donald Trumpâ€™s strategy to remake the electoral map by winning Rust Belt states including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Hillary Clinton leads Trump by 15 points in Michigan and nine points in Pennsylvania, the pollster finds: Trumpâ€™s plan to win New York state looks even worse in a new Siena College poll of Empire state voters. It gives Clinton a 23-point, 54-31 lead. The GQR pollâ€™s 11-point lead for Clinton in Florida marks the third time this month a survey has found Clinton ahead by double digits in the state, FiveThirtyEightâ€™s Harry Enten points out: People with local knowledge donâ€™t quite believe all GQRâ€™s numbers, however. Nevada journalism dean Jon Ralston thinks Clinton is up by â€œmiddle single digitsâ€\\x9d in the state, instead of tied with Trump, as GQR depicts: Trump, for his part, registered surprise Thursday morning that he was not doing better in the polls. Trump told radio interviewer Mike Gallagher, â€œI go to Ohio, we were there two days ago, and Pennsylvania and near Pittsburgh and we â€“ I was in West Virginia, the crowds are massive. And you know, I walked out of one and I said, â€˜I donâ€™t see how Iâ€™m not leading.â€™ You know, you see the kinds of crowds. We have thousands of people standing outside trying to get in... And Iâ€™m saying, you know, â€˜Why am I not doing better in the polls?â€™ The Donald Trump campaign is more than doubling its roster of pollsters, with three new hires who previously backed the Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Rick Perry presidential campaigns, respectively, the New York Times reports: Kellyanne Conway, a veteran pollster who has had a long working relationship with Mr. Trump, is among those joining the effort.[...] Mr. Trumpâ€™s team is also expected to bring on Adam Geller, who works with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Michael Baselice, who was the pollster for former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and for the stateâ€™s governor now, Greg Abbott. Trump previously paid two pollsters. The Democratic national committee has denied a report that the party is looking into options for moving Hillary Clintonâ€™s acceptance speech at the national convention in Philadelphia from the Wells Fargo Center (seats 19,500) to a larger venue. The BillyPenn local media site exclusively reported that the Democrats were looking for a larger venue, quoting US Representative Bob Brady: Philly Congressman Bob Brady said nothing has been finalized but â€œthereâ€™s talk about it. â€œItâ€™s a good idea by the way, too,â€\\x9d said Brady, who is honorary vice chair of the DNC. â€œIt engages people and gets people involved.â€\\x9d But a DNC press secretary told BillPenn, â€œThis is absolutely incorrect. There is no talk of changing venue.â€\\x9d CBS Newsâ€™ Sopan Deb flags a section from Trumpâ€™s Mike Gallagher interview in which the candidate is invited to weigh in on the Supreme Courtâ€™s striking down a restrictive Texas abortion law three days ago. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t see thatâ€\\x9d under a Trump presidency, Trump says. â€œAnd - and people understand that.â€\\x9d Hillary Clintonâ€™s top aideâ€™s husband likes the idea of a Christie pick: The Republicans are ready to nominate Trump for president and Democrats are doubting their luck? New Jersey governor Chris Christie is being vetted as a potential running mate for Donald Trump, CNN reports. Mike Murphy, who ran Jeb Bushâ€™s Right to Rise political action committee, says guessing whom Trump will pick is hard: Hereâ€™s a shortcut to get the Christie vetters started: April 2016: Christie has lowest job approval rating to date, poll shows A new Rutgers Eagleton survey released Thursday found the governorâ€™s approval has dipped to 26 percent, a drop of three percentage points since quitting the presidential race in February. FranÃ§ois Hollande of France, he of the 17% approval rating, told Les Echos that a Donald Trump presidency would be dangerous and â€œthe best service the Democrats could render would be to get Hillary Clinton elected.â€\\x9d Sheâ€™ll want to get this right into her swing-state ad buys. Hollande tells the interviewer that a Trump presidency would complicate European-US relations and says that Trumpâ€™s slogans differ little from those of the extreme right in Europe and in France: fear of migration, stigmatization of Islam, challenging representative democracy and denouncing elites, even though Trump himself is a wealthy elite. In a radio interview snagged by BuzzFeedâ€™s Andrew Kaczynski, Donald Trump weighs in on the chance (?) Bill Clinton - Loretta Lynch meeting in Phoenix on Tuesday. Trump says the meeting shows how â€œthe system is riggedâ€\\x9d and calls it one of the biggest stories of the year: â€œIt is an amazing thing. I heard about it last night,â€\\x9d Trump says on the Mike Gallagher Show. â€œThey actually went onto the plane as I understand it. And it was really a sneak. And it was really something they didnâ€™t want publicized. â€œI think itâ€™s so terrible. I think itâ€™s so horrible. I think itâ€™s the biggest story, one of the biggest stories of this week, of this month, of this year. [...] â€œItâ€™s a massive story now. Itâ€™s all over the place.â€\\x9d Like Maine, Nebraska splits its electoral votes by congressional district. Two go to the state winner and one goes to the winner of each congressional district. In 2008 Barack Obama snagged an electoral vote in Nebraskaâ€™s second congressional district â€“ Omaha and environs. But they voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Clinton is hoping to take Omaha back for the Democrats. The campaign has announced it will begin airing two ads in the district focusing on Clintonâ€™s â€œdedication to helping childrenâ€\\x9d and on the childrenâ€™s health insurance program, which Clinton helped create as first lady. Hereâ€™s the CHIPs ad: Polling! Am I right? On the heels of (relatively less-well respected) Rasmussenâ€™s survey depicting Trump up four points, (relatively well respected) Reuters/Ipsos releases the latest edition of their weekly tracking poll and it has Clinton up 10 points, 42-32. Whom to believe? The averages, weâ€™re taught. RealClearPolitics hasnâ€™t incorporated the latest Reuters yet and has Clinton up 4.9 points. HuffPost Pollster has baked in both Rasmussen and Reuters and has Clinton up 6.9 points. Ipsos asked 1,247 registered voters nationally: â€œIf the 2016 presidential election were being held today and the candidates were as below, for whom would you vote?â€\\x9d In the head-to-head Clinton-Trump matchup, 14% of respondents said neither. Clinton showed 75% support among Democrats and Trump showed 70% support among Republicans. In a four-way race with the Libertarian and Green Party candidates, Clintonâ€™s lead on Trump widened to 11 points, 42-31. Trump had a 61% unfavorability rating in the poll, compared with Clintonâ€™s 54% unfavorability rating. The poll also asks for party preference in local congressional races. Democrats have quite a lead in the poll â€“ 44-33. Rasmussen Reports â€“ a pollster with a mean-reverted bias of two points toward Republicans, according to FiveThirtyEight (which gives Rasmussen a lackluster C+ in its pollster ratings) â€“ has released a new national poll in which Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton by four points, 43-39. The same poll last week had Clinton up five points, 44-39. Polling averages have Clinton up by five or seven points, depending on which average you consult. The national poll, conducted by telephone and online, surveyed 1,000 likely voters on 28-29 June. The margin of sampling error was +/- 3%. Read further here. Drudge tweeted the poll and Trump has RTâ€™d it to his fans hungry for good polling news. Unfortunately for Trump, thereâ€™s very bad polling news ahead (stay tuned for an update on Reutersâ€™ tracking poll)... Former president Bill Clinton â€œwalked overâ€\\x9d to a plane carrying attorney general Loretta Lynch for a chat on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International airport Tuesday Monday, the AP reports. With the greatest threat to his wifeâ€™s presidential campaign, in many peopleâ€™s opinions, being a potentially aggressive investigation by Lynchâ€™s justice department into Hillary Clintonâ€™s email practices, Clintonâ€™s decision to engage Lynch could appear inappropriate, an effort to curry favor, or, cynics might even think, to prejudice the investigation. Lynch told reporters they did not talk about the emails and did talk about his grandkids, AP reports: Lynch was traveling with her husband and said her conversation with the former president â€œwas a great deal about his grandchildrenâ€\\x9d and their travels. The former president, who recently became a grandfather for the second time, told her he had been playing golf in Arizona and they discussed former Attorney General Janet Reno, whom they both know. â€œThere was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body. There was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of the State Department emails, by way of example,â€\\x9d Lynch said in Phoenix. Former top Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod called the meeting â€œfoolishâ€\\x9d: Republican senator John Cornyn raised the prospect of a conflict of interest on Lynchâ€™s part: Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Donald Trump appears not to have filed paperwork to forgive personal loans he made to his campaign, raising questions about whether donations to the campaign could still be used to pay back Trump personally. Last week, with some fanfare, Trump announced that he was writing off $45m in debt, but â€œthe FEC has posted no record of Trump converting his loans to donations,â€\\x9d NBC News reports, and â€œthe Trump campaign has also declined requests to share the legal paperwork required to execute the transaction, though they suggest it has been submitted.â€\\x9d Fox News poll shows 9-point swing toward Clinton A Fox News poll of registered voters nationwide released late Wednesday had Hillary Clinton up 44-38 over Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The poll has been trending dramatically in Clintonâ€™s favor in the last two months. In May, it had Trump up by three points, 45-42. Real Clear Politicsâ€™ polling averages currently have Clinton 6.1 points ahead. Republican senator not quite on Trump train Utah senator Mike Lee, the first senator to endorse Ted Cruz for president, described in unprecedented detail last night why he was not ready to endorse Trump. â€œWe can get into that if you want,â€\\x9d Lee says. Then he really gets into it: Obama: â€˜If in fact Brexit goes throughâ€™ At a summit of North American leaders in Canada Wednesday, Barack Obama suggested that the Brexit might not actually happen: I think there are some general longer-term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain, or in Europe as a whole. Hereâ€™s that handshake again: Speaking of Brexit, maybe keep an eye on British politics today: Trump campaign in hot water for soliciting foreign donations Trumpâ€™s campaign has been asking foreign politicians for donations to help make America great again â€“ possibly violating federal election rules in the process. On Wednesday, two campaign finance watchdog groups, the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21, said they will lodge a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that Trumpâ€™s campaign has violated federal law by soliciting donations from politicians in Scotland, Australia and Iceland, among others. â€œDonald Trump should have known better,â€\\x9d said Paul S Ryan, deputy executive director of Campaign Legal Center. â€œIt is a no-brainer that it violates the law to send fundraising emails to members of a foreign government on their official foreign government email accounts, and yet, thatâ€™s exactly what Trump has done repeatedly.â€\\x9d Romney says family wants him to run Two-time Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival Wednesday that members of his family are still pushing for him to enter the race a third time as a third-party candidate, if only to thwart the accession of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Trump to the presidency. â€œMy wife and kids wanted me to run again this time,â€\\x9d Romney said. â€œI got an email from one of my sons yesterday, saying â€˜You gotta get in, Dad. You gotta get in.â€™â€\\x9d But Romney said a third-party candidate could not win and he did not sound like he was going to try. Trump has a news conference scheduled for this afternoon in Manchester, New Hampshire. He will talk more about trade, his campaign advises. Hereâ€™s Lauren Gambinoâ€™s fact check of his last trade speeches. Itâ€™s not open to the public. Thank you for reading and please join us in the comments.',\n",
              "  \"Lord Ashcroft's Belize bank hit by wave of withdrawals An offshore bank owned by Tory donor Lord Ashcroft has closed a large number of customer accounts and faced a wave of withdrawal requests after becoming increasingly caught up in a US tax-evasion crackdown, the has learned. The value of deposits at Belize Bank International (BBI) shrank by almost three-quarters in the space of just six months, and confidential emails seen by the suggest some BBI customers have struggled to recover their cash. So stretched is the position that BBI in April told a court in Belize that it could not pay a $3.3m judgment against it without liquid assets falling below the minimum amount required by law. Ashcroft, 70, has a fortune estimated at Â£1.34bn after decades as an investor and deal-maker in businesses ranging from car auctions to cleaning services and offshore banking. Best known in the UK as the former Conservative party deputy chairman who fell out with David Cameron, the peer co-wrote last year a biography of the former prime minister notable for its allegations of debauched student years. Ashcroft was awarded a peerage in 2000 at the request of the partyâ€™s then leader William Hague. It later emerged, however, that a promise he had reportedly given at the time â€“ to relinquish his controversial tax exile arrangements â€“ had not been kept for many years. Ashcroft resigned from the House of Lords last year, but remains closely involved in British politics through his polling and publishing businesses. Ashcroft also owns the influential Tory website ConservativeHome, where he writes regularly. Contacted by the , Ashcroftâ€™s offshore bank BBI denied it was in crisis and said it faced a short-term problem. There is no allegation that BBI evaded tax, or that the bank knowingly helped customers to do so. However, tough US anti-evasion laws have increased compliance costs for BBIâ€™s partners, prompting Bank of America and Commerzbank to terminate relationships with the bank. The departure of these partner banks has in many instances left BBI struggling to maintain basic services for account holders. Adding to BBIâ€™s woes, US tax inspectors revealed last September that they are investigating suspected evasion by some of the bankâ€™s customers. The inquiry comes at an especially unhelpful time for BBI as it attempts to find replacement partner banks. BBI confirmed that â€œcertain deposits have been returned to customersâ€\\x9d, and that the loss of partner banks was â€œan important developmentâ€\\x9d. â€œBBI is strong and very well-capitalised,â€\\x9d a spokesman said, adding that deposit withdrawals had in fact strengthened the balance sheet. Asked about long delays on withdrawal requests, he said: â€œThe bank is satisfied that it has fulfilled its obligations with expedition, and has done so effectively.â€\\x9d However, according to documents seen by the , some customers have had to wait months for their money to be returned. One was told last June that his account was being terminated and that he should provide final wire transfer instructions within eight days. Four months later, BBI told the customer there were still â€œconsiderable delaysâ€\\x9d with money transfers because of the loss of partner banks. In March, he was told: â€œWe are currently unable to complete or execute wire transfers â€¦ You are â€¦ welcome to visit us here in Belize to withdraw the funds in person.â€\\x9d More recently, BBI has suggested a customer could alternatively reapply for a Visa credit card, which he could then use to withdraw funds in batches from a cash machine. Another BBI account-holder to have complained of problems with money transfers was the Belizean arm of Mossack Fonseca, the offshore law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal. The Panama Papers, obtained by SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, were shared through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) with the and other media. Leaked emails show Mossack Fonseca sought advice from a local law firm in Belize last August about its BBI bank account. The law firm replied: â€œBBI is closing all offshore accounts â€¦ It is a shock to us as well especially with the very short time line provided. It is the first time we are experiencing this type of situation â€¦â€\\x9d A spokesman for BBI said only selected accounts had been closed and this was part of a long-planned strategy. â€œOf its own volition, and in common with many other financial institutions, BBI has been engaged in a de-risking programme for several years,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThis has meant that â€¦ [certain] depositorsâ€™ funds have been repaid.â€\\x9d In April, BBI bosses told the supreme court of Belize it had received unprecedented withdrawal requests. Its chairman, Lyndon Guiseppi, explained that, while the bank was financially robust, there was a short-term squeeze on cash meaning it would struggle to pay a $3.3m court judgment. He said: â€œIf [the bank] has to make payments due under the order this will have serious consequences for the bank, the wider financial sector and the broader economy of Belize.â€\\x9d Such a payment, Guiseppi added, would â€œstymie the bankâ€™s ability to make payments to depositors, which the bank â€¦ is coming under increasing pressure to do so [sic].â€\\x9d The crisis is blamed on big overseas banks terminating partnership arrangements, known as â€œcorrespondent banking relationshipsâ€\\x9d, with BBI and other banks in Belize. These relationships provide the means by which Belizeâ€™s offshore banks can provide services to its customers around the world. According to credit ratings agency Moodyâ€™s, Bank of America and Commerzbank accounted for 80% of correspondent banking services in Belize until late last year. Belizeâ€™s prime minister, Dean Barrow, has blamed the exodus of correspondent banks on draconian regulations and unsubstantiated smears from Washington. â€œCurrent US policy is proving existentially damaging â€¦ to the [Caribbean] sub-region of which Belize is a member,â€\\x9d he has said. â€œThere are ... continuing statements classifying our jurisdictions as harmful tax havens. This is designed to put our offshore sector out of business. â€œIt is a kind of damnation by innuendo since no bill of indictment listing any specific instances of violation is ever offered. But the implication that doing business with us is fraught with risk is crippling our jurisdictions.â€\\x9d Ashcroft, Belize and BBI Ashcroftâ€™s bank is one of the oldest in Central America, established in 1902 in what was then British Honduras. For 75 years the bank traded as a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, which â€“ despite its name â€“ had extensive operations around the Caribbean. In 1987, the branch was bought by Michael Ashcroft, the son of a British colonial administrator who had attended school in Belize before being sent to boarding school in Norwich. In 1990, in part after advice from Ashcroft, Belize passed laws creating an offshore financial centre. Modelled on legislation in the British Virgin Islands, this was a bold move to attract investment into the country, newly independent but economically weak. At the same time, the government granted Ashcroftâ€™s bank a 30-year special tax break, paving the way for BBI to prosper, catering to customers outside the country. Since then, Ashcroftâ€™s banking and related Belizean interests have become a mainstay of the tiny economy, in particular its financial services. Belize has a population of 350,000, more than 40% of whom live in poverty. Ashcroft, who owns a colonial style home on the Caribbean seafront in Belize City, was made the countryâ€™s ambassador to the UN, and in 2000 was knighted by the Queen â€“ who remains Belizeâ€™s head of state â€“ for services to the local community. While he is well known for his political donations in the UK, Ashcroft has also taken an active interest in Belizean politics, reportedly contributing financially to both main parties. As in the UK, he has on occasion fallen out with some Belizean politicians on specific issues, including the prime minister. Together, Ashcroftâ€™s main Belizean business interests are listed on the London stock exchange as Caribbean Investment Holdings (CIH), though three-quarters of shares remain under Ashcroftâ€™s ownership. In its latest annual report, CIH told investors that at the end of March last year its balance sheet was part-funded by $249m of customer deposits that could be withdrawn on demand. Of that sum, central bank data suggests, $102m was deposited by businesses and individuals with accounts at BBI. Since then, however, BBI deposits have dropped to Â£31m. BBI does not disclose how many deposit accounts it provides, or where its overseas customers are based. The vast majority of deposits are thought to have been made in US dollars, with a much smaller amount in sterling and lesser sums in euros and Canadian dollars. The CIH annual report, published last September, reassured shareholders that past experience suggested that customer deposits would remain â€œa long-term and stable source of fundingâ€\\x9d.\",\n",
              "  'Ad watchdog cracks down on misleading broadband ads The advertising watchdog is to crack down on the way broadband packages are marketed after research showed that four in five people were not able to work out how much they are supposed to pay. The Advertising Standards Authority is to start a crackdown on the way companies including Sky, BT, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, EE, 3 and O2 advertise after finding that the public are confused and misled by broadband deals. The ASA is to introduce new advertising rules from 30 May following research, conducted with media regulator Ofcom, that found widespread confusion, with 81% of those surveyed not able to correctly work out the total cost across the lifetime of a broadband contract when asked to do so. Currently, broadband ads feature an array of prices including the monthly cost of the broadband itself, separate line rental and frequently a raft of additional pricing options such as installation fees, introductory offers and contract length. The research found that just 23% of survey participants were able to correctly work out the total cost per month of a broadband package and all extras in the first viewing of an ad. And 22% of participants were still not able to get it right at a second viewing of a broadband deal ad. The ASA says that if this proportion were extrapolated to the whole of the UK it means that about 4.3m households have no idea how much they are actually paying for their broadband packages. â€œItâ€™s essential we make sure people arenâ€™t misled by pricing claims in broadband ads,â€\\x9d said Guy Parker, chief executive of the ASA. â€œWeâ€™ll be moving quickly, working alongside broadband providers to clarify the presentation of price information.â€\\x9d From 30 May, the ASA is going to crack down on ads that have complicated pricing, and will rule that they break the UK advertising code. While companies can continue to choose how they want to market broadband deals after that date, the ASA is â€œsuggestingâ€\\x9d a series of guidelines. These include using an all-inclusive price on all costs, including line rental, and greater prominence of up-front costs and contract lengths. â€œOfcom wants to see clear and accurate broadband prices for consumers,â€\\x9d said Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom. â€œOur research shows many people are confused by complicated ads and offers. We welcome the ASAâ€™s plans to simplify broadband advertising.â€\\x9d The ASA said that last year it received 730 complaints about a total of 555 broadband ads. It ruled that 56 of the broadband ads were in breach of the UK advertising code, a relatively high 10% of all cases â€œSimplifying how broadband prices are advertised is a step in the right direction, but the advertising of broadband speeds must also be tackled,â€\\x9d said Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which? â€œBroadband is an essential part of life and millions of homes are not getting the speed they expect. We want the advertising authorities and the regulator to change the rules and ensure consumers get the speeds they are promised by their provider.â€\\x9d TalkTalk said that it fully supported the ASAâ€™s move, pointing out that it had already called for â€œall-inâ€\\x9d pricing in a response to Ofcomâ€™s digital communications review. â€œItâ€™s obvious that a single headline price is much clearer and better for customers, and weâ€™re actually already doing it on a pilot project up in York,â€\\x9d said a spokeswoman for TalkTalk. â€œBut until the whole market moves to single prices, any company that advertises its products like this will struggle to compete with what look like better deals from other providers. We want Ofcom to be bold and tackle this problem in their strategic review and we would absolutely support them in doing so.â€\\x9d Sky said that it follows all advertising rules and that it has the best customer satisfaction levels in the industry. â€œWe work hard to ensure customers are fully informed when weâ€™re marketing Skyâ€™s products and services and our advertising adheres to all industry guidelines,â€\\x9d said a spokeswoman. â€œOfcomâ€™s recent customer service report showed our customer satisfaction levels are the highest in the industry. We will review the new research and work with the ASA to ensure our advertising is in line with any new guidance it introduces.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Bank's warning of a Brexit double whammy is very handy for Osborne Britain will make up its mind whether it wants to remain in the European Union in six weeks time, so it was inevitable that the last Bank of England inflation report before 23 June was dominated by the referendum. And make no mistake, the warning from Threadneedle Street about the likely short-term consequences of a Brexit vote â€“ including a sharp fall in the value of the pound â€“ is mightily handy for George Osborne. The Bank assumes that there will be a double whammy of weaker growth and higher inflation in the event of a vote to leave. For the first time Mark Carney was even prepared to use the R word: there would be a chance of technical recession - two successive quarters of negative growth - if the decision is to leave. The Bankâ€™s inflation report says Brexit could lead to lower consumer spending, mothballed investment plans, higher unemployment and problems funding the UKâ€™s record current account deficit â€“ which has reached 7% of GDP. It believes there is a risk that foreign investors will shun the UK and strain the banking system. Carney summed up the Bankâ€™s view in his letter to the chancellor [PDF] explaining why inflation remains more than a percentage point below the governmentâ€™s 2% target. The combined effect of leaving would, the governor said, be to â€œlower growth materially and raise the rate of inflation materiallyâ€\\x9d over the next couple of years. Osborneâ€™s reply to Carneyâ€™s letter showed that he intends to milk the Bankâ€™s warning for all it is worth. The Leave camp noted that despite the Bankâ€™s warnings about sterling, the pound is currently at a higher level than it was when the referendum was called, and that Carney should be careful that his words did not become self-fulfilling prophecies. Nor is it the case, as Osborne has been asserting, that interest rates would inevitably rise after a Brexit vote. The forecasts contained in the Inflation Report assume that the bookies have got it right and that Britain will vote to remain in the European Union. These show that the uncertainty caused by the referendum is temporary, with growth slightly lower in 2016 but picking up in 2017. But by 2018, when everything has come out in the wash, growth is 0.2 points lower than expected at the time of the February inflation report at 2.3%. Thatâ€™s despite the financial markets taking the view that interest rates will stay lower for longer, and the 9% drop in the value of sterling since November â€“ both of which should boost growth. But, as the Bank noted, only half the poundâ€™s fall has been the result of uncertainty caused by the referendum. The other half is caused by a realisation that the UK suffers from poor productivity, low levels of investment and a chronically weak trade performance. Those problems are not going to magically disappear whatever the vote on 23 June.\",\n",
              "  'Opera adds built-in adblocker to its browser Opera is introducing a new version of its desktop browser with built-in adblocking, removing the need for a third-party extension. The Norwegian software company has a history of innovations that later become common in other browsers, such as tabbed browsing. It was also an early pioneer of pop-up blocking, which targeted an earlier generation of in-your-face ads. Opera says the move can reduce page-loading times by as much as 90% by preventing the browser having to make requests to ad networks, which slows page loading. Because it is building the feature directly into its browser, page-load times are 40% faster than with existing adblocker plugins or browser extensions, the company claims. More than 9 million (22%) of the UKâ€™s internet users have an adblocker installed, a recent report found, and the proportion is considerably higher among 18- to 24-year-olds, with almost half using some form of adblocker. Operaâ€™s built-in adblocker will initially only be in the desktop version of its browser but it intends to add it to its mobile version in future. An Opera spokeswoman said: â€œAdblocking technology is an opportunity and a wake-up call to the advertising industry to pay attention to what consumers are actually saying.â€\\x9d Faster loading, increased privacy and security and a desire for fewer distractions are behind the growing demand for adblockers, but their use is causing concern for publishers who rely on display advertising for revenue. Earlier this month the culture secretary John Whittingdale, called adblocking a â€˜modern-day protection racketâ€™. A study by PageFair and Adobe (PDF) estimated online ad revenue lost to blockers in 2015 would amount to $21.8bn (Â£15.4bn) and those losses could almost double to $41.4bn in 2016. Ad-placement firm Carat forecasts global digital and mobile advertising will near $150bn this year. Opera, which has agreed to a takeover by a group of Chinese firms led by Beijing Kunlun Tech in a cash deal valued at $1.23bn, introduced its first computer web browser in 1995. With the rise of the smartphone, it shifted to focus on the mobile browser and advertising market, where it now derives most of its revenue, and has 281 million users. The Oslo-based firm ranks a distant fifth behind mainstream desktop computers browsers from Microsoft, Google, Firefox and Apple. The company counts 60 million active monthly desktop users worldwide. It relies on advertising in its browser for a big chunk of its own revenue but says it sees no contradiction with introducing adblocking controls that affect pages. An Opera spokeswoman said demand for adblocking should abate when messages became less disruptive and more relevant.',\n",
              "  'Emma Barnett joins the big league on BBC Radio 5 Live When Emma Barnett goes on air for her first mid-morning show on BBC Radio 5 Live this Wednesday, sheâ€™ll be taking on one of a handful of big talk-radio gigs broadcasting to the nation. Her excitement is palpable. â€œThis is a huge project. Iâ€™ve thought about nothing else for four months,â€\\x9d she says with a big smile. â€œI am desperate to start. The best way to do radio is to do it. Radio gigs like this donâ€™t come along very often.â€\\x9d Barnett, a former digital media and then womenâ€™s editor at the Telegraph, got her break in radio on LBC and currently has a Sunday night show on 5 Live where she dissects the stories making an impact online. But swapping it for three-hour shows from Wednesdays to Fridays is a big step up for which she has been planning enthusiastically . On Wednesdays she will broadcast from Millbank in London, timed to coincide with prime ministerâ€™s questions and pulling in a revolving panel of MPs including Labourâ€™s Chuka Umunna, the former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan and the Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. She says the quality of guests is partly due to the â€œunprecedented momentâ€\\x9d Labour and the Conservatives find themselves in that means â€œweâ€™ve never had so many A-list MPs out of frontline politicsâ€\\x9d. Thursdayâ€™s show moves back to the BBCâ€™s base in Salford and Barnett plans to bring the audience into the usually-behind-the-scenes process of choosing the news agenda, setting up interviews and shaping the dayâ€™s programme. â€œI think some of the most interesting conversations we have are off-air are [those in which] we are deciding the news, [discussing] the angles, what we are going to try to find out, all of that,â€\\x9d she says. â€œWe are there to do breaking news but also allow the listeners to come in a bit on our morning news meeting and deconstruct that for them. I think itâ€™s really interesting to show a bit of leg on radio.â€\\x9d Then on Friday, with the nation getting the #Fridayfeeling vibe, Barnett will try to explore ambition, talking to people who have done well but with one eye on the dissatisfaction with life that she says drove some of the British public to vote for Brexit. The showâ€™s pattern has been developed since Barnett left the Telegraph at the end of April. Since then she has since taken a holiday and been appearing on a Sky News debate show, The Pledge, but she isnâ€™t giving up newspapers. Last month she joined the Sunday Times as an advice columnist, using her first piece to open up about the impact of her father going to prison a decade ago, in a bid to gain her readersâ€™ confidence. Broadcasting from her home town â€“ Manchester â€“ is especially pleasing for Barnett because it underlines how the BBCâ€™s relocation to Salford has revitalised a place she once felt she had to leave to get a start in media. â€œI was born in Hope hospital literally two seconds away from the studio. For me, sitting there, I look around and think, â€˜wowâ€™. I mean in the space of 12 years what was effectively a wasteland with a war museum is now a media centre. â€œIf there had been Media City when I was doing my A-levels and looking at degrees â€¦ and then I went off to do the Cardiff [journalism] course, I could have come back to Manchester, I wouldnâ€™t have had to leave to go to London. And I really hope that for the next generation that could be the case.â€\\x9d Barnettâ€™s debut will boost the number of hours of talk radio fronted by women in an industry that is dominated by male voices. She defends 5 Liveâ€™s track record in the area, saying it has a â€œtradition of ambitious brilliant female broadcastersâ€\\x9d and citing former presenters including Anita Anand and Kelly Cates as well as current colleagues including Eleanor Oldroyd. However she concedes that there is still an imbalance across radio that needs addressing, partly to do with â€œlegacy issuesâ€\\x9d and those men in the industry who quite understandably want to remain in enjoyable jobs. â€œThere is something important about getting women to host programmes, regardless of it looking good,â€\\x9d she says. â€œIt actually affects, first of all, the lens sometimes of what you are looking at, but also it affects who calls. I have noticed that if I also put a woman caller on air first â€¦ then more women ring.â€\\x9d With her credentials in feminism (she launched the Telegraph womenâ€™s section, called Wonder Women) and technology, Barnett is exceptionally well-placed to talk about the culture of abuse on social media. Add in the fact she has publicly talked about her Jewish faith and it is perhaps not surprising she has been on the receiving end. In 2013 she was one of a number of journalists and other prominent women on Twitter who received a tweeted bomb threat. â€œI went to the pub but I think a few of them rang the police. And the next thing I knew, the Today programme [was] saying these 15 journalists have all had this. I thought, â€˜Oh God, Iâ€™m probably so immune now to some of this stuff. â€™ When you put your head above the parapet, you get stuff. I try to have a bit of a sense of humour if I can. I have a routine: if I get off air and there is something there, I just mute it or block it. And thatâ€™s the way I deal with it. I donâ€™t ever engage.â€\\x9d She says there is more that tech companies could do to tackle the issue but thinks at its root itâ€™s a reflection of social ills for which the technology industry canâ€™t be held completely accountable. She adds that abuse isnâ€™t just a problem for those who get it but also for those who are put off speaking out by it and the public who miss out on what they have to say. â€œI think women are socialised from birth to be liked and very likable, be a sweet girl, be a nice girl, be a lady. And because women tend to get most of the abuse â€¦ I worry that we are all putting out very bland things online just to get a thumbs up, just to get hearts, just to get likes â€¦ and you really want debate.â€\\x9d In a somewhat ironic twist, it was her role as a tech editor that led her to where she is now. â€œThe reason I got into radio was because, when I got the first British interview with the Twitter founders, Ev [Williams] and Biz Stone before they ever got a PR, I got them slightly squiffy in a bar in San Francisco. I listened back to my tape that night in my hotel room and thought â€˜God, that was a really good conversation. They were really funny, and now Iâ€™ve got to write it up. I wish someone could have heard that.â€™ And then Iâ€™m like, â€˜hang on a minute, that exists. Itâ€™s called radioâ€™. â€œItâ€™s not like any other [medium] to me. You can go deeper, you can go further and you can also speak directly to people: thatâ€™s what makes it incredible. Your audience can interrupt you. And I hope they do.â€\\x9d',\n",

We try to win every time we play â€“ we just had a bad moment but we have another 33 points to try and arrange it.â€\\x9d City have 47 points and are separated from fifth-placed Manchester United only on goal difference. Asked how many points might be need to be crowned champions, Pellegrini said: â€œItâ€™s impossible to guess the future. I said before the end of first round of leagues maybe the winner has less than 80 points. Itâ€™s impossible to know â€“ I am sure the champions [will have] around 75 points or more.â€\\x9d Yaya TourÃ© missed the loss at Liverpool but is fit return on Saturday. â€œYaya has an important kick on his heel,â€\\x9d he said. Thatâ€™s why he couldnâ€™t play Wednesday but heâ€™s OK.â€\\x9d This week the top-ranking executives of the so-called big five clubs â€“ City, United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool â€“ met organisers of the International Champions Cup, a pre-season tournament, and discussed potential changes to the Champions League. Pellegrini said: â€œIn this moment the Champions League is very important and the Premier League is the best in the world so to make changes is not easy. Maybe they can be improved [a little]. I donâ€™t think you can talk about any of this in just a few words.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Acne and exam stress among factors leading young people to suicide, study finds Exam stress, acne and asthma are among the anxieties affecting children and young people who kill themselves, according to the first ever detailed national investigation of these cases. Between January 2014 and April 2015, there were 145 suicides in England by children and young people aged 10 to 19. An inquiry looking at 130 of the cases has found some common factors, or â€œantecedentsâ€\\x9d, which the researchers hope may help families, friends, teachers or others to become aware that a child is struggling. More than half (54%) of the 130 had self-harmed and 27% had expressed suicidal ideas in the week before they died, while in 16 cases (12%), they had searched online for information on it. But 43% had not been in contact with the health service or any other agency. More than a third (36%) had sought help for some sort of medical condition, the most common being acne and asthma, while 27% were dealing with academic pressures, says the report. Of the 20 young people facing current or pending exams or awaiting results, 11 were known to be stressed by their exams and four died on the day of an exam or the day after. More than a quarter of the young people (28%) had recently experienced the death of somebody close to them, and six had lost more than one. Nine had lost a parent, while 17 (13%) had experienced the suicide of either somebody in their family or a friend. More than a fifth (22%) had been bullied in previous months, mostly face to face (93%). Eight had been targeted by online bullying â€“ as well as face to face or instead of it. Mostly the bullying had occurred more than three months before the person died, but in eight cases it was more recent. The findings come from the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness, a collaboration of academics and other experts, who have collected data from Coronersâ€™ inquests, official investigations and other case reviews. The report, summarised in a paper in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, is the first of its kind. â€œThere havenâ€™t been very systematic studies of a very young group,â€\\x9d said Prof Louis Appleby, director of the inquiry at the University of Manchester. â€œSuicide is one of the main causes of death but it is not at all common. What is happening in their lives? That is the question we started with.â€\\x9d The suicide rate is very low among the youngest children â€“ there were 11 cases under the age of 15 in the year. But Appleby said: â€œSomething happens to them in that five-year period from 15 to 20.â€\\x9d At each age after 15, there is a significant jump in the numbers, reaching 49 at the age of 19. Most â€“ 70% â€“ are male. The reasons for the rise are complex, he said. â€œThere are often family problems such as drug misuse or domestic violence and more recent stresses such as bullying or bereavement, leading to a â€˜final strawâ€™ factor such as an exam or relationship breakdown.â€\\x9d The adolescent years are a turbulent time, he added. â€œThe emotional resilience required to get you through is pretty strong,â€\\x9d said Appleby. â€œThey are having to cope with quite a lot of changes in key parts of their lives.â€\\x9d Alcohol, drugs and mental health played a part in some of the older age group, but there were some more unexpected findings, such as the numbers who went to the GP for help over acne or asthma. â€œWe were slightly surprised that these physical health conditions were quite prominent,â€\\x9d said Appleby. He thinks there is a link between the two conditions. â€œIt is the impact on your social life â€“ the social withdrawal when acne becomes an embarrassment or with asthma, the physical restriction which limits your contact with other people,â€\\x9d he said. Coronersâ€™ reports had found these conditions significant enough to be mentioned. The finding that the majority of children and young people who killed themselves had self-harmed was important, said Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity YoungMinds. â€œThis report provides a stark reminder that self-harm should never be dismissed as â€˜attention-seekingâ€™ or â€˜just a phaseâ€™,â€\\x9d she said. â€œAlthough only a small proportion of young people who self-harm go on to feel suicidal, the fact that they are injuring themselves is a clear sign that they are experiencing terrible internal pain. â€œThe good news is that there are things that parents and professionals can do to help: above all, stay calm, avoid being judgemental and reassure them that they can talk to you openly about how they are feeling.â€\\x9d She said it was â€œdeeply alarmingâ€\\x9d that exam stress was a factor in many suicides. â€œItâ€™s absolutely crucial that schools give as much focus to wellbeing as they do to academic achievement,â€\\x9d she said. Prof Nav Kapur, the inquiryâ€™s head of suicide research said: â€œSelf-harm is strongly associated with increased future risk of suicide and is one of the main warning signs. It is crucial that there is improved help for self-harm and access to mental health care. â€œHowever, with the variety of factors we found with this study, it is clear that schools, primary care, social services and youth justice all have a role to play.â€\\x9d A larger study looking at suicides up to the age of 25, with recommendations for further action, will be published next year. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

              "  'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekendâ€™s action 1) Long-term Matip injury would be significant Hands have been wrung and doom predicted about Philippe Coutinhoâ€™s injury, likely to keep him out of the Liverpool team until next month. And to an extent, rightly so: he has been their most impressive attacking threat this season, and the sight of that front four dovetailing has perhaps been the most pleasing in the division. However, the 4-3 defeat to Bournemouth on Sunday suggested that another injury absence might be more significant, namely JoÃ«l Matip. The Cameroonian centre-half has been a quiet, calm example of consistency, exactly the sort of thing that Liverpool missed against Bournemouth. The simple scoreline, plus a cursory viewing of the game, indicated JÃ¼rgen Kloppâ€™s men will be okay scoring goals without Coutinho, but preventing them without Matip who has a minor ankle injury, could be more problematic. Nick Miller â€¢ Match report: Bournemouth 4-3 Liverpool â€¢ Klopp defends Karius after late collapse â€¢ Barney Ronay: Fraser inspires madcap turnaround 2) Ledley and Puncheon do the damage The mood at Selhurst Park after this result was of a corner turned. That, it seems fair to say, is a tad premature. Six defeats in a row do not happen by chance and Alan Pardew faces Manchester United and Chelsea after the crucial fixture at Hull City next weekend. But one distinct positive for Crystal Palaceâ€™s fans will have been the resilience shown by Pardewâ€™s players in a disciplined win against Southampton. Key to the performance were three players who starred in Tony Pulisâ€™s Palace incarnation: Damien Delaney, Joe Ledley and Jason Puncheon. Their play was characterised by hard work, physicality, and taking the right decisions at the right times. Delaney kept Charlie Austin shackled, Ledley unsettled Saintsâ€™ passing rhythm and it was a typically smart piece of anticipation from Puncheon that led to their third goal. It all added up to Palace never truly being threatened by Claude Puelâ€™s misfiring side, who lost concentration at crucial moments. Paul MacInnes â€¢ Match report: Crystal Palace 3-0 Southampton â€¢ Pardew eases the pressure, then criticises owners 3) Mourinho losing his touch and United losing points The troubling thing about JosÃ© Mourinho in the past 18 months or so is that new weaknesses keep emerging in his teams. His apparent ability to get players to do anything for him went west, as did defensive solidity, and now there is apparently a lack of mental fortitude. The late penalty conceded fairly clownishly by Marouane Fellaini, then converted by Leighton Baines, was the fifth goal Manchester United have conceded in the last 10 minutes of games this season, costing them eight points. Those points would have put them just one behind Manchester City and snapping around the Champions League places: as it is they are a fairly distant sixth. Mourinho protested after the game that in all his teamâ€™s six draws they have been the better side, but itâ€™s not much use if they continually throw results and points away at the last. NM â€¢ Mourinho sticks to script after draw â€¢ Mkhitaryan finally makes case as a United player 4) Cleverley fails to impose himself on Everton team It was interesting that, in response to a series of lacklustre performances, Ross Barkley was the man dropped from the Everton side by Ronald Koeman against Manchester United. Yet whether you think his demotion was harsh or not, not many could defend the identity of his replacement. It was tricky not to feel sorry for Tom Cleverley, removed after 65 insipid minutes to the sound of cheers from his own fans, but you can also understand why those fans were happy to see him go. Itâ€™s seven years since he made his senior debut and, in that time, he hasnâ€™t really made clear exactly what sort of player he is, and the question that poses itself is: whatâ€™s he for? The moment that seemed to irk the Goodison crowd most came when he played a backwards pass near the edge of the United area as an attack built, thus removing all momentum from it, and seemed to sum him up neatly. Perhaps Barkley does need a spell out of the team, but replacing him with Cleverley, a player for whom a sideways pass seems to represent the height of ambition, is not the way to go. NM â€¢ Match report: Everton 1-1 Manchester United 5) City have no excuse despite referee mistake Leaving aside the touchline fracas when the game was won, the major debate at the Etihad Stadium was over whether David Luiz should have stayed on the pitch long enough to be fouled by Sergio AgÃ¼ero in the final minute. The fact that he was the last defender when he illegally blocked AgÃ¼eroâ€™s run on goal in the first half is not really the point. The rulebook makes no mention of last defender, despite the termâ€™s common usage, focusing instead on whether a clear goalscoring opportunity has been denied. That is of course harder to judge, and it seemed to everyone present that Anthony Taylor bottled out of making a judgment by pretending nothing had happened. Doubtless the referee would have been criticised too had he dismissed David Luiz, because he was still a long way from goal, and there would have been even greater outrage had he booked the defender, which is the least the offence deserved, and let him stay on the field. Yet some sympathy for the official is possible. There is no room for compromise in these situations, referees must choose between all or nothing. Taylor chose nothing, perhaps wrongly. Manchester City still had an hour of football and the useful gift of an own goal to try to get over it. Paul Wilson â€¢ Match report: Manchester City 1-3 Chelsea â€¢ How Conte beat Guardiola in the battle of three-man defences 6) Burnley need to find goals fast The last time Burnley were in the Premier League, they won three games away from home, two of which were too little, too late efforts, with relegation already confirmed. They had a similar problem when they were in the top flight in 2009â€“10 too, that time winning just one, drawing one and losing the rest. The pattern seems to be repeating itself this season: the 2-0 defeat at Stoke on Saturday was their fifth reverse in six games on the road, and the only time they have avoided a loss was a goalless draw at Old Trafford at the end of October. Maybe even more troubling is that they have scored only once away from Turf Moor, a penalty consolation in a 3-1 defeat at Southampton. Sean Dyche was quick to criticise Stokeâ€™s apparent gamesmanship and the refereeing on Saturday, but that is not the reason theyâ€™re falling down the table. NM â€¢ Match report: Stoke City 2-0 Burnley 7) More wins could lead to more Short money Sunderlandâ€™s manager smiled at the suggestion his players were starting to resemble a â€œDavid Moyes teamâ€\\x9d. It has taken time but Moyes is showing his ability by somehow making the Wearside team look much more than the sum of their parts. If specialist defensive tutorials with Lamine KonÃ© and Papy Djilobodji have helped, his attacking work on Victor Anichebe has been transformative. Three vindicating wins in four games have bred optimism but, to maintain the upward trajectory, Moyes wants victory in a trio of key games this month against Swansea City, Watford and Burnley. Such success would represent more than the collection of nine crucial points; it might persuade Ellis Short, the clubâ€™s owner, to invest in much needed playing reinforcements next month. Short would welcome a takeover but securing one might involve a little speculating to accumulate, preferably starting with Yann Mâ€™Vilaâ€™s long awaited importation from Rubin Kazan. Louise Taylor â€¢ Match report: Sunderland 2-1 Leicester City â€¢ KonÃ©â€™s return to form a factor in Sunderlandâ€™s renaissance 8) Past performance could be guide to Spursâ€™ gain Are Tottenham Hotspur ready to make their move again? When Spurs lost at Chelsea on the Saturday before last, their Premier League record stood at W6 D6 L1 and they sat fifth in the table, which was a mirror image of their numbers from the corresponding point of last season. Last time out they then drew at home against Chelsea, whereas on Saturday they hammered Swansea City. In other words, Spurs are statistically better off now than when compared with their superb season of 2015â€‘16. What happened last season was they went on an extraordinary run at around this time. Can Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s team fashion a repeat? Their elimination from the Champions League was a blow but they could benefit from a clarity of domestic focus. Harry Kane is back from injury and firing and there were signs of greater collective fluency against Swansea. Pochettinoâ€™s players have tended to enjoy a physical dividend from his conditioning programme. He senses a turning point. David Hytner â€¢ Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 5-0 Swansea City 9) Evans and McAuley will give Costa a true test When Chelsea try to extend their Premier League winning sequence to nine matches on Sunday, they will be confronted by better defenders than they found at Manchester City on Saturday. Few teams have a central defence as strong as West Bromwich Albionâ€™s Northern Irish-axis. Jonny Evans is a consummate defender whom John Stones, for instance, might have benefited from studying if Evans had not been deployed in midfield when City won at West Bromwich in October. And Gareth McAuley, who turns 37 on Monday, has played every minute of every league match for Albion this season and been superb for most of them: strong, savvy and like Evans, always liable to contribute a goal from set pieces. Watching Diego Costa â€“ on excellent form himself â€“ take on that pair at Stamford Bridge should be one of the highlights of next weekend. Paul Doyle â€¢ Match report: West Brom 3-1 Watford â€¢ West Bromâ€™s ascent offers Pulis chance for added value 10) Wenger looks for consistency after difficult November Even if he famously banned Arsenalâ€™s players from eating chocolate, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger must have been relieved to crack open his advent calendar on Thursday after another disappointing November. Their return of 1.7 points per game in the Premier League was a slight increase on previous years, but a costly Champions League draw against Paris Saint-Germain and the tame defeat of Wengerâ€™s second string by Southampton in the EFL Cup last week showed his side remain vulnerable. The dismantling of a West Ham side in disarray was the perfect response, even if Arsenalâ€™s manager knows there will be much stiffer tests ahead with trips to Everton and Manchester City to come this month. â€œRecently, we lost a little bit the quality of our game, and we started [to lose] a little bit with results,â€\\x9d he said. â€œA draw here, a draw there, a draw against PSG that was not completely convincing, and today we found the flow again. So I think we just have to concentrate on the quality of our game and try to repeat that week in, week out.â€\\x9d Ed Aarons â€¢ Match report: West Ham 1-5 Arsenal â€¢ Bilic bears burden of expectation as bubble bursts',\n",

              "  'Evolution director Lucile HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡: â€˜The starfish was the one worryâ€™ â€œI seem to have a bit of a problem with reality,â€\\x9d says Lucile HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡. Or perhaps the French film-maker is just committed to a reality of her own. Her new film, Evolution, set on a mysterious island, is itself an enigmatic outcrop, far off cinemaâ€™s well-mapped charts. It depicts an uncanny world inhabited by young boys and their eerie mothers; curious medical procedures are carried out at the islandâ€™s hospital, placing the boys in uncomfortably close proximity with starfish. Part horror story, part visual poem, it shows why HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ is one of the few authentic visionaries in cinema today. It also makes it clear why hers has not been the easiest career to pursue. Evolution comes a full 12 years after her first film, Innocence â€“ itself a wistful nightmare, set in a girlsâ€™ school situated deep in a dark forest. Both films showcase an approach to sexuality and the corporeal that is, if not perverse, certainly nonconformist. They are films you would struggle to imagine on paper â€“ which is why it took so long to get Evolution funded, she says. â€œPeople didnâ€™t understand what the script was about. Itâ€™s a film about sensations, emotions â€“ not storytelling â€“ so people had to bring their imagination to the table. We really tried to explain it, but itâ€™s the sort of film where, if you start, the whole thing collapses like a house of cards.â€\\x9d On one level, Evolution seems quite clear: part of the meaning is in the title, which alludes to humanityâ€™s marine origins. Among other things, the film is a set of variations on every possible resonance of the French wordplay on la mer (sea) and la mÃ¨re (mother). â€œI donâ€™t approach any of that in a conscious way,â€\\x9d says HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡, â€œbut the film is full of archetypes and motifs that are there in our collective consciousness. The starfish isnâ€™t a symbol of something, but it does have several meanings. Theyâ€™re simple images, but complex ones.â€\\x9d Implicitly a parable of male puberty, Evolution seems a counterpart to Innocence, which evoked female coming of age in a similarly elusive manner. But HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ never had a diptych in mind. â€œIâ€™m not sure that Evolution really is about boys. I just wanted to tell a story about maternity and pregnancy, and I thought those things would seem a lot more strange and unsettling if it all happened to a boy. When I was 10, I couldnâ€™t see much difference between being a boy and a girl, anyway.â€\\x9d In the decade after Innocence, HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ struggled to finance Evolution, with another feature project falling apart in the meantime. She did, however, manage to make a characteristically intense 17-minute short called Nectar, a dialogue-free erotic reverie about bees, massage and the colour yellow: â€œInnocence was about puberty; Nectar is more about the menopause,â€\\x9d she laughs, leaving me to puzzle over exactly how. Evolution was eventually shot on Lanzarote, its rocky coasts giving the film a lunar visual tone. One reason for shooting there, HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ says, was because French child protection agencies would never have accepted the filmâ€™s horror dimension, with children placed in terrible situations. Not that anything realistically grisly happens to the lead, 13-year old Max Brebant â€“ but still, the storyâ€™s traumatic aspects must surely have been hard for the directorâ€™s child actors to accept. Not really, she says. â€œFor them, it was just a fantasy world with monsters and all that â€“ at that age, you feel totally at ease with that kind of thing. They never asked me anything about the story; maybe they were protecting themselves. The one thing that worried Max was when he had starfish placed on his body. When I first saw that image for real, even I found myself thinking: â€˜OK, thatâ€™s actually a bit much.â€™ But he seemed quite at ease.â€\\x9d However, HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ admits there was another scene that worried Max, in which an adult woman gives him the kiss of life. The filmâ€™s themes of puberty and (at least implicit) child sexuality may make Evolution a stumbling block for some viewers. HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ has ventured on such risky ground before: Innocence played with storybook images of prepubescent girls. But HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ always insisted that she was drawing on her own fantasies of idealised girlhood; sheâ€™s surely the only French film-maker ever to be influenced by Enid Blytonâ€™s Malory Towers. For her, Innocence was entirely true to its title. â€œI was really surprised that people read any kind of perversity into it. I started to worry that that might contaminate Evolution too â€“ but the real difficulty people had with that film was more to do with horror. Strangely, boysâ€™ bodies seem to be less taboo in cinema than girlsâ€™. If weâ€™d put little girls on the operating table instead, perhaps that would have been more shocking.â€\\x9d The word â€œshockingâ€\\x9d isnâ€™t really the operative one when it comes to HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡â€™s work. She has a very different sensibility to that of her partner, French cinemaâ€™s arch-provocateur, Gaspar NoÃ©. The pair started making films as a duo: he shot her debut mini-feature, La Bouche de Jean-Pierre, AKA Mimi (1996), and she edited and produced his early works Carne and I Stand Alone. They work separately these days, but HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ was involved in the development of NoÃ©â€™s trippy afterlife drama Enter the Void â€“ â€œa script that took a really long time to write, even though people think it didnâ€™t have a script at allâ€\\x9d. HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡, 54, grew up in Morocco, where her father â€“ the surname is Bosnian â€“ had moved from Yugoslavia. Aged 12, she started reading a lot of science fiction, notably Ray Bradbury and Theodore Sturgeon and then discovered horror writer HP Lovecraft, whose fascination with all things tentacular and aquatic is unmistakably imprinted on Evolution. Moving to France at 17, she studied art history, before graduating from the Paris film school La FÃ©mis. â€œPerhaps 80% of my year was girls,â€\\x9d she says, â€œbut very few went on to make films, I donâ€™t know why.â€\\x9d Yet despite her difficulties in finding finance, her gender has never been the problem, she says. â€œItâ€™s not because Iâ€™m a woman; itâ€™s because Iâ€™m me. In France, the whole thing of imagination and metaphor really isnâ€™t in the culture. People donâ€™t mind if it comes from elsewhere, but if itâ€™s from our country, thatâ€™s difficult.â€\\x9d In current French cinema, HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ is pretty much out on her own limb with her commitment to the textures of the imagination. â€œSometimes when you dream, the images are neutral, but they have a real emotional charge that doesnâ€™t seem to fit,â€\\x9d she says. â€œThatâ€™s what Iâ€™m trying to capture. When I start a film, I never really know what itâ€™s about, and I want to find out â€“ to explore that zone of mystery.â€\\x9d This has left her feeling somewhat isolated as a film-maker, but she has found kindred spirits. Among them are HÃ©lÃ¨ne Cattet and Bruno Forzani, the duo behind febrile neo-giallo oddity Amer. â€œFor a long time, I never had a cinema family in France, apart from Gaspar. If I have cousins, itâ€™s them, and people like [British director] Peter Strickland. Iâ€™ve never met him, but when I saw his last film [The Duke of Burgundy], it was as if someone had personally written me a letter.â€\\x9d Sheâ€™s also passionate about Thai maestro Apichatpong Weerasethakul: â€œHis films are always about very simple, concrete things, yet he turns them into something mythological.â€\\x9d Right now, HadÅ¾ihaliloviÄ‡ is intrigued by the idea of telling a story rooted in a recognisable everyday environment. â€œIâ€™d love to make a film that wasnâ€™t set somewhere abstract like an island or a forest, but in Paris. But Iâ€™m pretty sure it wouldnâ€™t be entirely realistic. My way of thinking just has a whole element of imagination that I canâ€™t get rid of. And I donâ€™t want to get rid of it, either.â€\\x9d Evolution is released in the UK on 6 May.',\n",

              "  'Swansea Cityâ€™s owners to make huge profit with sale to US investors The owners of Swansea City, whose partnership with the supporters trust has long been hailed as ideal for a British football club, are set to make millions by selling their shares to American investors. The deal, signed in principle by the chairman, Huw Jenkins, values Swansea at around Â£100m, exactly 100 times more than the Â£1m paid for the club by the nine shareholders, including the trust, during and after a financial crisis in 2002. The agreement proposes the eight shareholders apart from the trust â€“ which owns 21.1% of the club and whose elected director, Huw Cooze, was furious at being kept unaware of the negotiations â€“ sell most of their shares to a consortium led by the US sports team investors Stephen Kaplan and Jason Levien. Intense discussions since have led to suggestions not all the shareholders will sell, and Levien and Kaplan may buy only a 60% stake, but their valuation, for a Premier League club awaiting the next tranche of vast TV fortunes starting next season, remains around Â£100m. So Jenkinsâ€™ 13.2% stake, which cost him Â£125,000 to buy, is valued at Â£13.2m. He is understood not to be planning to sell all his shares and is likely to remain the chairman if the takeover completes, because he is widely credited with having run the club with great acumen, alongside the other directors. The local hotelier Martin Morgan and his wife, Louisa, are the largest shareholders with a 23.7% stake, which cost Â£225,000 to buy; it is now valued by Kaplan and Levien at around Â£23.7m. Martin Morgan is said not to be intending to sell, and Levien may try to have separate discussions with Louisa Morgan, who controls more than half of their stake. One of the original 2002 investors, the South African businessman Brian Katzen, owns 10.5% of the club, as does his business partner, Jeffrey Crevoiserat; the stakes cost each man Â£100,000 when Swansea were floundering near the bottom of the Football League at a rundown Vetch Field, and are now valued at Â£10.5m each. Robert Davies, another original investor, also a financial backer of Swanseaâ€™s Ospreys rugby union region which shares the Liberty Stadium, also has a 10.5% stake. The Dutch investor John van Zweden, and Leigh Dineen, formerly the trustâ€™s elected director who bought his own shares for Â£50,000, both have stakes of just over 5%, now valued at Â£5m. The millions to be made by the shareholders who do sell follow Â£4m already paid to them all in dividends over the past four years â€“ Â£1m, in effect their original stakes repaid, each year from 2012-15 since Swansea have been in the Premier League. Paid proportionately according to their stakes, Jenkins has received more than Â£500,000; Martin and Louisa Morgan Â£900,000; Katzen, Crevoiserat and Davies Â£400,000 each, and Van Zweden and Dineen around Â£200,000 each. The trust, for its 21.1%, has been paid more than Â£800,000, which it has used to buy new shares and for a â€œrainy dayâ€\\x9d fund. Established as a mutual, democratic, not-for-profit body during Swanseaâ€™s 2001 financial crisis, with the help of the fan-ownership initiative Supporters Direct, the trustâ€™s members who have provided contributions for the Â£200,000 investment cannot cash in personally if the trust ever sells. Cooze, who has told a trust forum he was â€œpretty damned hurtâ€\\x9d at the secrecy of the negotiations, is now seeking to rebuild bridges with his co-directors and safeguard the trustâ€™s position. Levienâ€™s revised suggestion to buy 60% is intended to show the trust a preparedness to work with them, after supportersâ€™ hostile reaction to the proposed acquisition of 75.1% control. Cooze and the trustâ€™s chairman, Phil Sumbler, say they knew the other shareholders would sell at some point and are sanguine about them making so much money. They mostly want to know whether the sale to Levien and Kaplan, which Jenkins in his official statement said he believed â€œwill help the club progress on and off the fieldâ€\\x9d, will bring actual investment into the club itself. â€œThere is no point in a deal without money for the club; that would just be a sale for the shareholdersâ€™ personal gain,â€\\x9d Sumbler said. He pointed out that supportersâ€™ unpaid work and donations have contributed to Swanseaâ€™s remarkable revival over the past 15 years and massive increase in financial value. â€œThe shareholders are mostly lifelong fans, and we have always believed throughout our partnership with them that they have the best interests of the club at heart.â€\\x9d Levien, a lawyer, is the managing general partner of Washingtonâ€™s Major League Soccer team, DC United, having previously been involved at three NBA basketball franchises, including the Memphis Grizzlies, to which he introduced Kaplan as an investor. Kaplan, the principal of Oaktree Capital investment fund, is thought to be the largest proposed investor in the acquisition, with several others so far not named. Levien has been assuring people they have substantial money and are not financing the deal with debt. In meetings with the shareholders in Swansea last week, Levien is understood to have emphasised their plan is to develop the club but has not made firm promises that the consortium will invest new money of their own for signing players or expanding the stadium. Like other US investors increasingly taking over clubs, Levien and Kaplan are attracted by the Premier Leagueâ€™s success, the huge TV income, expected to be Â£8bn across the league for the three years from next season, and the prospect of growth in popularity and earnings, particularly in America, over the next 10-15 years. The US culture of sports team ownership is much more avowedly commercial than British footballâ€™s traditional local â€œbenefactorâ€\\x9d shareholders, who have mostly sold out in the Premier League years. Investors in American sports seek to make money by growing their franchises commercially and therefore increasing their value, and that of their own stakes. Levien and Kaplanâ€™s plan is to do the same at Swansea, and promoting the club in the US is thought to be a key feature of the proposed deal. All of which is a world away from the crumbling, loss-making club the shareholders, galvanised by the trust and wider supporter efforts, bought for Â£20,000 in January 2002, putting the rest of the money in to pay off debt. Chroniclers of Swanseaâ€™s spectacular upward flight since occasionally miss out two key boosts: a company voluntary arrangement, by which creditors settled for only 5p in every pound, and the great gift of the Â£27m Liberty Stadium, which is still owned by the local council. Now, as thousands of jobs locally are threatened in the Port Talbot steelworks, the Swansea City shareholdersâ€™ proposed gains highlight again modern footballâ€™s stand-out riches, in increasingly post-industrial cities where the clubs evolved more than a century ago. Jenkins and Dineen declined to comment on the proposed sale, citing confidentiality agreements. Katzen said of his original motivation that he was keen on football and the challenge, and said they were all determined to make progress and run the club as a business, but never envisaged the success they have had, and these exponential profits. â€œIt has been 15 years, a lot of work; itâ€™s not a quick buck,â€\\x9d Katzen said. â€œNobody expected to get anything out of the club at the beginning.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Bob Diamond's interest in Barclays Africa confirmed Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond is part of a consortium that is preparing to bid for the bankâ€™s African operations, it has been confirmed. â€œThe consortium has committed long-term strategic investors. The funding is in place. There is support for this potential transaction,â€\\x9d Diamond told investors in the London-listed African based bank, Atlas Mara, which he formed after being forced out of Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis in 2012. Diamondâ€™s involvement in the consortium, which includes the private equity firm Carlyle, was revealed in a stock market announcement by Atlas Mara after days of speculation about his interest in trying to buy shares in Barclaysâ€™ African business. Barclays will face questions about its plans to reduce its 62.3% stake in Barclays Africa - which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange and has interests in banks across the African continent - when it publishes its first quarter results on Wednesday. Diamond did not provide details about the size of any offer for the Barclays African operations, but he is expected to need to raise around $5bn (Â£3.5bn). Barclaysâ€™ new boss Jes Staley announced last month he wanted to cut the 62.3% stake in the African business to reduce the complexity of its operations and to save capital. Atlas Mara, which has operations in seven African countries, indicated that it expected to be taken over by the the consortium if a deal was struck. â€œIn the event that the consortium reaches a definitive agreement with Barclays in relation to Barclays Africa, it is expected that Atlas Mara will enter into substantive discussions about the potential combination with the consortium,â€\\x9d Atlas Mara said. â€œGiven the significant complexity and early stage of the discussions with the consortium, there can be no assurance that the transactions discussed above, including the potential combination, will be completed.â€\\x9d Diamond is working on the consortium with Ashish Thakkar, whose Mara conglomerate also backed the creation of Atlas Mara. Atlas Mara is worth a third of what it was when it was floated in December 2013.\",\n",

No, not the Obamas, who made their feelings plain at the Democratic convention last week â€“ the Simpsons. The long-running Fox comedy show released a short clip on YouTube late on Sunday night, showing Homer and Marge Simpson watching a political advertisement on late-night television in order to settle who they plan to vote for. The ad in question follows the format of Hillary Clintonâ€™s famous â€œ3amâ€\\x9d spot from the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, with a severe voiceover asking the animated couple â€œwho [they] want answering the callâ€\\x9d. In one version, the proverbial 3am call is answered by former president Bill Clinton, who is ruefully forced to admit that the call is for his wife. â€œFrom now on, itâ€™s always for me,â€\\x9d the former secretary of state snaps at her husband. But the most scathing humor of the spot is saved for Donald Trump, portrayed as a pasty, bald autocrat reading a book of Adolf Hitlerâ€™s speeches when the call comes in. â€œNot now â€“ Iâ€™m on Twitter!â€\\x9d Trump says, before mocking Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he apparently has exiled from the United States. After instructing his lackeys to put his name on the Lincoln Memorial, disband Nato and â€œmake Chris Christie eat a worm just for laughsâ€\\x9d, Trump finally answers the phone call requesting his immediate presence in the Situation Room, but requires a pit crew of beauticians to attend to his appearance before he leaves.

              "  \"Captain Britain would fight to remain in EU, says superhero's creator Heâ€™s the champion of the United Kingdom, the countryâ€™s first Marvel superhero, resplendent in union flag costume â€“ but how would Captain Britain vote in the EU referendum? He is firmly in the remain camp, according to the writer who helped create him 40 years ago, Chris Claremont, amid unconfirmed reports that the superhero could be revived by Marvel in a new TV programme. â€œHe would definitely vote for the UK to stay in Europe,â€\\x9d the veteran comics scribe said. â€œFrom his perspective, we donâ€™t move ahead by building a wall around our bit of the global village.â€\\x9d Captain Britain was created by Claremont and the artist Herb Trimpe at the behest of Marvel Comicsâ€™ founder, Stan Lee, who wanted to test the water in the 1970s with a British answer to Captain America. Britain had a strong tradition of reprinting old Marvel strips such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four in black-and-white weekly editions, but this was the first original character created for Marvel UK. In the comics, Captain Britainâ€™s alter ego is Brian Braddock, the son of an aristocratic family living in Maldon, Essex, who had fallen somewhat on hard times â€“ though Braddock was still educated at the private Fettes College in Edinburgh. He gets his new identity when he is confronted by a vision of Merlyn (a Marvel character claiming to be the Merlin of British legend), who grants him the abilities to become Britainâ€™s super-powered champion. And that means being the champion for all Brits - including immigrants, says Claremont. â€œHe would see it as the point being not to lock people out of the country, but finding a way to make everyone feel welcome whoever they are.â€\\x9d Captain Britain was rebooted in the 1980s by the British writer Alan Moore and the artist Alan Davies, giving him a new costume that was reminiscent of classic British military pomp, and sent on an epic adventure across multiple parallel Earths. In 1988 Claremont returned to the character, teaming up with Davies for the US Marvel title Excalibur, which involved Captain Britain leading a super-team based in London comprising members of the X-Men and his sister Betsy. Claremont believes Captain Britainâ€™s experiences across the parallel universes â€“ where he encountered multiple alternate versions of himself â€“ would make him realise the value of being in the European Union. He said: â€œFrom Captain Britainâ€™s point of view we live in a great, heavily populated omniverse and our reality is just one part of that. In each of the parallel worlds there is a lighthouse on every shore of every England where the champion has his base. â€œHis role is to see the bigger picture and to stand up as an exemplar of things worth fighting for, to foster a sense of commonwealth. Captain Britain is not about representing an empire, heâ€™s about standing up for everyone and fighting for the betterment of all. Thatâ€™s not such a bad ethos for a super-hero.â€\\x9d\",\n",

David Harding, its chairman, said the board was doing all it could to save the building society. â€œAlthough there is uncertainty regarding the long-term future of the society, we continue to put the best interests of our members first,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThe board is developing a number of options which, individually or in combination, are reasonably expected to secure the future of the society, to enable it to continue to meet capital requirements and to improve the quality of its regulatory capital.â€\\x9d The building society swung to a Â£4.9m loss in 2015, following a Â£4.5m profit in 2014. It is in the process of winding down its mortgage book, offering no new loans. Its loan book fell to Â£331m last year from Â£387m a year earlier. A spokesman for Manchester Building Society said it still had about 4,000 mortgage borrowers, as well as about 18,000 savings accounts. Last year, the mutual wrote to savers with more than Â£75,000 in their accounts, warning them that the maximum amount protected under a national compensation scheme would fall in 2016 to Â£75,000 from Â£85,000. The amount was cut because of changes in the exchange rate, and all banks and building societies were required to write to those customers with more than Â£75,000. Savers are protected by the financial services compensation scheme (FSCS), which pays out if a bank or building society fails and is unable to refund deposits. Recent building society troubles have not resulted in the FSCS having to step in as larger building societies have taken on customers. In 2008, Nationwide rescued the Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies, while Yorkshire has taken on the accounts of Norwich & Peterborough, Barnsley and Chelsea. Manchester Building Society was founded in 1922 and has one branch, on Manchesterâ€™s Queen Street. Problems at the mutual date back to 2013, when it was required by new accounting standards to change the treatment of its long-term mortgage book and related interest-rate hedges. The changes had a negative impact on its financial position. The society said it was exploring a number of possible options to secure its future, including a capital injection from other parties or a merger. â€œThe board expects to develop these plans over the next few months. These plans may involve third parties and as such carry execution risk. â€œWhilst an assessment of the different options has not yet been completed the board is satisfied that it is reasonable to expect a successful outcome.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Philip Hammond presents the 2016 autumn statement â€“ as it happened For six years George Osborne, as chancellor, David Cameron and all their ministerial colleagues were able to bulldoze through opposition to their policies by asserting that they had a â€œlong-term economic planâ€\\x9d. It passed the test of all good soundbites by becoming so familiar as to be groan-inducing. In some respects the term was misleading, because Osborne missed his targets and had to rejig his plans, but the claim that the Conservatives were on a path towards eliminating the deficit seemed to impress the public and this strategy helped Osborne and Cameron to win the 2015 general election. Today Philip Hammond consigned the LTEP to the dustbin. In truth, it collapsed the day the UK voted for Brexit but Hammond had to tell MPs that the EU referendum result has blasted a huge hole in the national finances and he has all but abandoned any hope of getting the budget into surplus on his watch. Osborneâ€™s targets have been abandoned, the government plans to carry on borrowing and spending (the autumn statement envisages a fiscal loosening of almost Â£9bn by 2021-22) and, although the Treasury hopes to balance the budget in the 2020s, it wonâ€™t say when this might happen. All of this is quite sensible, but it is not the economic prudence that won the Tories the 2015 election. In the past governing parties have been consigned to opposition for a decade or more for economic mismanagement on this scale. But there is no sign of this happening to the Conservatives. Cameron did not ask the country to vote for Brexit, and nor did Hammond, or Theresa May. Hammondâ€™s political authority remains intact. Yet the autumn statement will have disappointed those who expected Mayâ€™s â€œJamâ€\\x9d-focused government to be quite different from Cameronâ€™s. When she became prime minister in July May said she would focus her attention on those just about managing (the Jams). Today was her first big chance to strike out in a new direction but, although the statement contained some progressive measures (eg universal credit and letting agentsâ€™ fees), what was striking was the continuity with Osborne, not the contrast. How much difference has she made? Just 7%, according to a Resolution Foundation analysis. (See 5.33pm.) Thatâ€™s all from us for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Philip Hammond buried the governmentâ€™s goal of balancing the nationâ€™s budget in this parliament today -- and the financial markets didnâ€™t bat an eyelid. The pound has jumped by one percent against the euro today, to â‚¬1.18 -- a ten-week high. Itâ€™s also higher against the dollar tonight too, up half a cent at $1.245. Thatâ€™s might surprise you -- surely the news that Britain needs to borrow an extra Â£122bn to rise out the Brexit storm should spark a sterling crisis? But no. The City is welcoming Hammondâ€™s new spending plans. OK, todayâ€™s figures are small potatoes compared to Donald Trumpâ€™s $1trn infrastructure plan -- but they should mean growth isnâ€™t as weak over the next few years as feared. Hammond took some pleasure in pointing out that Britain is still expected to grow as fast as its eurozone rivals next year, even after todayâ€™s downgrade to 1.4%. The Â£122bn of extra borrowing announced today may take some swallowing, though. UK borrowing costs have risen today, as traders anticipate more UK gilts hitting the market (bond yields rise when prices fall). Weâ€™ve also seen that almost half that fiscal black hole is directly due to Brexit, with the OBR saying leaving the EU will cost Â£58.7bn over the next five years. That includes a Â£16bn hit from lower migration (see earlier chart). Something to consider when policymakers weigh up the cost of a hard Brexit, vs one that gives better access to the single market. The public face an earnings squeeze over the next two years, when inflation is likely to rise nearly as fast as earnings. But the FTâ€™s Sarah Oâ€™Connor points out that we might avoid falling real wages, if the OBR isnâ€™t too optimistic... And the big picture hasnâ€™t really changed; Britainâ€™s economy is still suffering from low productivity and a debt hangover from the 2008 crisis, with Brexit casting another shadow. Richard Buxton, head of UK Equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, warns that we should remain cautious: In my view, substantial risks to the UKâ€™s economy remain, bringing into question an implicit suggestion that animal spirits will suddenly rise in the years ahead. As it stands, the country continues to face the same uncertainties that triggered such a sharp decline in the value of sterling in the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. This is from the BBCâ€™s Andrew Neil. Leave Means Leave has, curiously, chosen not to challenge the OBR analysis of the impact of Brexit in its autumn statement reaction (see 5.44pm), but Patrick Minford, co-chair of Economists for Brexit, has taken it on. He has put out this statement. The OBRâ€™s report issued today contains a number of assumptions around the impact of Brexit which simply follows the path of countless other establishment bodies, which have assumed a pessimistic outlook for the UK economy outside the EU, based on bad economic policy-making . Whilst it acknowledges the fact that the decision of the governmentâ€™s chosen path is uncertain, it then applies what amounts to an arbitrary Brexit penalty on the UK economy without any proper justification. Why does it assume lower productivity, a spending slowdown due to uncertainty and lower immigration? The work of Economists for Brexit has shown in each of these cases the reverse to be true. Our forecasts show that there is a positive impact of being outside of the single market and embracing free trade under WTO rules, creating an additional 4% GDP over the long term; recent outturns for the second and third quarters have shown clearly that there is no uncertainty effect; and on immigration our estimates are that unskilled migrants cost a total of Â£6.6 billion a year. Clearly, better control of unskilled workers, whilst continuing to encourage skilled migration can only have a positive economic impact. . These bodies tried to forecast economic disaster based on uncertainty before, in the months leading up to and just after the referendum, when uncertainty was at its highest. Yet there is no sign that there was any economic effect. So it is illogical in the extreme to forecast further disaster owing to uncertainty, just as the picture is becoming clearer. Of course it is true that if bodies like the OBR push out continual gloomy statements, if Downing Street gives no direction and if, when it does take a lead, takes Britain down the worst possible economic path then all this could come true. But, just as they did in the spring and the summer, they are mistaking the very worst outcome for a sensible forecast. Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says poor households faces a tough 2017, with inflation likely to devour wage rises. Previously announced benefit cuts will wipe out the benefits announced today, Kumar explains: â€œMany families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the reduction in the Universal Credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax personal allowance. However these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to work allowances imposed by George Osborne in April this year. A couple with two children each earning Â£25,000 a year will see a benefit of Â£588 a year from the income tax and universal credit taper changes, but will lose Â£1,308 from the benefit freeze and the cut in Universal Credit work allowances. John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation, fears that charities will face an increased burden as economic growth slows.... â€œWe know that during uncertain times charities are increasingly relied upon to support those in most need. In recent years charities have experienced rising demand for their services while resources have been increasingly stretched. More here: Here is some reaction to the autumn statement from thinktanks. From Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation The big picture today is the new chancellor accepting a major increase in borrowing, partly off the back of the Brexit vote, and choosing to increase it further with an expensive but welcome increase in capital spending. The result is Â£122bn additional borrowing, with national debt reaching 90 per cent of GDP next year. The outlook for family finances that lies behind the big growth and borrowing figures is also bleak, with average earnings set to be Â£830 lower by the end of the parliament than previously forecast. Despite increasing borrowing elsewhere, the chancellor has left the big welfare cuts intact and chosen not to provide significant support for the just managing families that Theresa May has rightly said she is focused on. The double whammy of lower earnings and benefit cuts mean that the poorest third of households are now set to face a parliament of falling living standards. In the months and years ahead the key task facing the government is to turn that situation around. From Ashwin Kumar, chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation 2017 is going to be a tough year as wages will barely grow faster than prices. Whilst there will be modest gains for some people from todayâ€™s Autumn Statement, for most people on below-average incomes, these will be dwarfed by previously announced cuts to benefits. With average wage growth predicted to be 2.4% and prices forecast to go up by 2.3%, most families will not feel much better off. The increase in the minimum wage will bring some relief to those on the lowest earnings, although even this is lower than predicted last March. Many families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the reduction in the universal credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax personal allowance. However these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to work allowances imposed by George Osborne in April this year. A couple with two children each earning Â£25,000 a year will see a benefit of Â£588 a year from the income tax and universal credit taper changes, but will lose Â£1,308 from the benefit freeze and the cut in Universal Credit work allowances. The majority of the benefit from the income tax changes will go to better-off families, and the Treasuryâ€™s own documents say that it will cost Â£2bn in 2017/18. Spent otherwise, these funds could have made a significant difference to families who are just about managing. From the Institute of Economic Affairs This was a thin and fiddly statement, so itâ€™s a relief that the chancellor has found one area of government activity to cut in abolishing the autumn statement. Sadly though, he has abandoned any attempt to balance the books. Over the next five years the government will be adding over Â£233bn to the national debt, as much as the entire annual welfare bill. Fiscal rules to this government sadly seem to be no more than vague aspirations which are abandoned with impunity. On the upside, the chancellor does seem to realise, however, that thereâ€™s no need to implement policy for the sake of it. A boring budget statement is better than a gimmicky one. From Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation This was a continuity autumn statement - deficit reduction while delivering the manifesto and a productivity plan. Itâ€™s essentially Osbornomics plus Â£100n of extra borrowing. We must wait for the major policy changes - for instance, the new industrial strategy - as well as the governmentâ€™s plans for Brexit. There is a risk that driving immigration down to â€˜tens of thousandsâ€™ could cause the public finances to deteriorate even further than the OBRâ€™s new forecasts predict. From Catherine Colebrook, chief economist at the IPPR At the beginning of his speech the chancellor made the now familiar claim that the British economy is in a strong condition. But the rest of his speech gave the lie to this. As he then admitted, UK investment and productivity are far below our major competitors, we have a record trade deficit, an unsustainable fiscal gap between projected tax receipts and public expenditure, and a regionally deeply unbalanced economy between London and the Southeast and the rest of the country. What he did not say, but was made clear during the EU referendum campaign, is how unequal the distribution of income and wealth has become. It is time that the national debate about the economy reflected these fundamental weaknesses. Tackling them will require a far more profound change to policy than the measures the Chancellor announced today. From Claudia Wood, chief executive at Demos No one is in any doubt that the government has a sizeable challenge trying to boost economic growth against a backdrop of ongoing instability caused by Brexit. At the same time, the governmentâ€™s commitment to the JAMs - perhaps in part recognising many voted to leave the EU as an expression of their frustration with the statue quo - necessitates spending in areas that matter most to them. This seems to be the approach Hammond is taking - popular giveaways such as the fuel duty freeze mixed with investment for growth. It seems incongruous, however, that we should be raising 40% tax bracket at all, helping as it does those at the upper end of the income scale while reducing the governmentâ€™s tax take. Here is the comment on the autumn statement sent out by Leave Means Leave, the successor to Leave.EU. It is from John Longworth, Leave Means Leaveâ€™s co-chair. Weâ€™re quoting it in full. It does not mention the OBR analysis of the impact of Brexit at all. The chancellor has made a good start on the road to making the British economy the best in the world. Investing in infrastructure and research and development, improving access to finance â€“ particularly for tech companies which ensures they do not have to sell out to foreign competitors, and funding for the Oxford â€“ Cambridge expressway are all very positive announcements. This is a solid base on which to build and crystalise the huge benefits Brexit brings to our country. Through signature ready trade deals, tariff reduction and removal, deregulation that will feel like a tax cut for UK businesses and real tax cuts - Brexit will enable the UK economy to thrive. The fringe benefit of Brexit is that the chancellor will have to make the UK the best country in the world to do business. His task now is to build confidence in the UK economy. He has a golden opportunity to improve further the strong economic forecasts and make Britain thrive, thanks to Brexit. Further OBR detail shows that the 80,000 a year reduction in net migration expected to follow the Brexit vote will cost Britain Â£16bn over the next five years. The OBR tables show that the reduction in net migration will come as a result of a tighter net migration policy and the UK becoming a less attractive place for migrants will cost the UK economy. It estimates that cut in migration will cost the UK economy Â£0.8bn in 2016/17 rising to Â£5.9bn a year by 2020/21. This is a total of Â£16bn over the next five years. Buried on page 160 of its report, the OBR makes the surprising prediction that Britain will be paying more to the EU in 2018-19 and beyond, despite Brexit. The watchdog has calculated that the fall in the pound will push up the UKâ€™s contributions to the EU budget (which are paid in euros), by Â£800m in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and Â£900m in 2020-21. But shouldnâ€™t Britain have stopped paying into the EU from March 2019? Not according to the OBR; it believes payments will continue, if Britain wants to keep access to, say, the single market. The Government has said it wishes to negotiate a bespoke arrangement with the EU. That may or may not include agreeing to contribute to the EU budget to retain some of the benefits that it has enjoyed from membership. Britain could also have to contribute to Brusselsâ€™ pension pot, and the European Investment Bank. And if British universities lose EU grants, the government may have to step in instead, the OBR adds. David Finch from the Resolution Foundation says the autumn statement reverses only 7% of the losses affecting the poorest half of households during this parliament. As Skyâ€™s Faisal Islam points out, the autumn statement document shows that the governmentâ€™s â€œwelfare capâ€\\x9d (a spending limit for certain welfare payments) is being relaxed. Why? Because, as the OBR report says, the government is on course to miss the current limit by 7% by the end of this parliament. And the â€˜welfare capâ€™ requires a subset of welfare spending to be held below a cash limit set in July 2015, but we now expect this to overshoot by more than 7 per cent by 2020-21. Caroline Lucas, the Green partyâ€™s co-leader, criticised Philip Hammond for not mentioning climate change in the autumn statement. She said: With Trumpâ€™s election this could have been a moment for Britain to become a world-leader in the fight against catastrophic climate change but, instead, we see little evidence of a commitment to facing up to the greatest challenge of our times. Indeed, it is shameful that the chancellor failed to even mention climate change in his speech. By caving into the motor lobby and freezing fuel duty again for the seventh year in a row the government has made a mockery of the fact that it is the hottest year on record and condemned us to more carbon emissions and deadly pollution. And here is Mark Reckless, a member of the Welsh assembly, responding to the autumn statement on behalf of Ukip. Despite the fearsome predictions of remain supporters, the overall prognosis for the economy is good, as we knew it would be. The official forecast is that unemployment in 2020 after we have left the EU will be just 860,000. This administers the last rites to the infamous claim that 3m jobs would be lost if we left the EU. We are borrowing too much, Â£68bn this year, Â£59bn next, and Â£122bn more than planned across the forecast period. The government has talked tough on austerity but failed to match its words with deeds. Every month the government delays Brexit costs the exchequer over a billion pounds. UKIP says just get on with it. Here is Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, on the autumn statement. This is a government that is just about managing. The official figures have revealed a Â£220bn Brexit black hole- hundreds of billions taken out our economy when we need it most. Given how bad the outlook is, itâ€™s no wonder the chancellor doesnâ€™t want to have to do another autumn statement. The OBR figures forecast a rise a unemployment and a fall in living standards. We are seeing a drop in tax receipts of Â£8.2bn over the next two years alone. Thatâ€™s enough to fund over 330,000 nurses. In response the chancellor offered nothing but reheated headlines and recycled announcements. The autumn statement was greeted with dismay within the education sector, which has been vociferously complaining about severe and worsening funding pressures in schools, with courses being cut, jobs lost and some sixth forms forced to close. In contrast to George Osborneâ€™s budget in March where education was at the forefront of his announcements, education was barely mentioned in the statement, bar the chancellorâ€™s confirmation of new capital funding to support the expansion of existing grammar schools - first announced in September. Treasury documents released after the statement said the government was committed to spending Â£50m in each year from 2017-18 on its grammar school expansion plan as part of its promise to ensure every child had access to a good school place. School leaders were unimpressed. Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the chancellor had failed to address the cash crisis in schools. The situation is so serious that some are struggling to deliver a full curriculum, courses are having to be cut and some sixth forms are closing. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, expressed similar disappointment. We know that school budgets are being pushed beyond breaking point. Almost nine out of ten school leaders are telling us that a rise in national insurance employer contributions and pension contributions are the key reasons behind financial pressures in their school. Freezing budgets at a time of rising costs is no protection at all. Capital investment in grammar schools is the wrong priority, and a distraction from the most important issues in education. Our economics editor Larry Elliott says that the autumn statement contained some important self truths about the UK economy: Philip Hammondâ€™s message was stark and clear. The result of the EU referendum in June means the economy has arrived at a reality checkpoint. Deep-seated weaknesses will be exposed as the government negotiates a Brexit divorce between now and 2019. The chancellor was candid about Britainâ€™s woefully poor productivity record. He admitted that infrastructure was deficient. There was no attempt to disguise the fact that there is a prosperity gap between London and other major cities. He used his autumn statement to address some of these long-term issues rather than to provide immediate help to the â€œjust about managingâ€\\x9d households, the so-called Jams, championed by the prime minister. To be sure, there was the pre-announced increase in the national living wage, the inevitable freezing of fuel duties for a seventh straight year and a change to universal credit to make the cuts announced by his predecessor less severe. Most of George Osborneâ€™s welfare savings will go ahead, however, with Hammond deciding the best way to help the Jams is through an economy that generates higher-paid jobs. He has also left money in the bank in case he needs it during what are certain to be tricky times for the economy during the two-year article 50 process.... More here: The Welsh governmentâ€™s finance secretary, Mark Drakeford, said the extra funding for Wales promised by the chancellor went some way to restoring cuts to its capital budget over recent years. The autumn statement included more than Â£400m of additional capital funding for Wales between 2016-17 and 2020-21 and Â£35.8m of revenue funding between over the same period. Drakeford said: As a government, we have been clear about the importance of investing in Walesâ€™ infrastructure â€“ in these uncertain times this is more important than ever. This is why we called on the UK government to boost investment to support economic growth. Although todayâ€™s announcement doesnâ€™t go as far as we had hoped, this extra investment goes some way to restoring the cuts we have seen to our capital budget over recent years. Last month the Labour-led government published its investment priorities for the next four years. This included delivering an M4 relief road in south Wales and create Metro systems in the south and north. Big decisions on energy have been bumped to a future budget. The fate of a future cap on subsidies for green energy such as offshore windfarms is now due in the spring budget next year, the autumn statement says. The chancellor said a carbon tax which is driving coal power plants to close would be kept at current levels until 2020, but failed to set out its long term plan (something George Osborne promised in the spring that this budget would do). As some commentators pointed out, today offered no clarity for the energy sector beyond the short term. Any promise of a crackdown on energy companies, as teased by Theresa May in her conference speech and recently by business secretary Greg Clark, will also wait for another day. â€œWe will look carefully over the coming monthsâ€\\x9d at the retail energy market, Hammond said. And thereâ€™s no news of the governmentâ€™s long-awaited plan on how itâ€™ll meet its carbon targets - all we hear from the autumn statement is that officials will keep on chatting to â€œstakeholdersâ€\\x9d to develop the blueprint. The plot thickens.... the Department for Business is now briefing that thereâ€™s NO new contingent liability with Nissan. So why wouldnâ€™t the Treasury tell the OBR that?! The TUC says the autumn statement shows working people will lose Â£1,000 a year by 2020. TUC economist Geoff Tilly explains in a blog: Overall real earnings are now expected to rise by only Â£23 a week between 2015 and 2020; at the budget they were expected to rise by Â£41. This difference of Â£18 a week amounts to nearly Â£1000 a year (Â£955). And here is a statement from the TUC general secretary Frances Oâ€™Grady. Todayâ€™s OBR forecast shows that the average annual wage will be Â£1,000 lower in 2020 than predicted at the Budget. And this is on top of wages still having not recovered to their 2007 levels. This is yet another blow to ordinary working peopleâ€™s standard of living. And far from being focussed on â€˜just about managingâ€™ families, this shows up the governmentâ€™s plans as inadequate. In his statement Philip Hammond announced various measures to increase housebuilding, including a Â£2.3bn housing infrastructure fund to build infrastructure to new homes. But, according to the OBR, the autumn statement measures will cut residential investment. The autumn statement includes a number of policies that are likely to affect housebuilding and residential investment. Dropping the requirement for housing associations to move to a shared ownership model and abandoning plans to force higher rents on some tenants will both reduce the cash inflows available for housebuilding. Partly offsetting that, additional grant funding and other smaller measures will increase cash inflows and boost housebuilding. The net effect is to reduce cumulative housebuilding by housing associations by around 13,000 over the forecast period, with a boost next year becoming a drag by 2019-20. The governmentâ€™s refusal to disclose what, if anything, it has promised Nissan about Brexit is causing quite a row. The Independentâ€™s Rob Merrick has asked the OBR whether the government has actually broken the law; the watchdog thinks not, but is keen that everyone knows about the Treasuryâ€™s reticence: Economist Alastair Smith, the former vice-chancellor of Sussex University, suspects Nissan has indeed been promised some sort of secret financial help (in case it suffers from Brexit, perhaps through new tariffs on exports to Europe) Tax specialist lawyer Jolyon Maugham is also rather surprised by the governmentâ€™s stance: The OBR says that if it hadnâ€™t been for the Brexit vote their projection for annual net migration to Britain would have been 80,000 a year higher at 312,000 in 2017 falling to 265,000 by 2021 and contributed around 0.2 percentage points each year to potential growth in the economy. They estimate that this net migration factor alone accounts for 0.9 percentage points of their judgement that the EU referendum has reduced potential output by 2.4 percentage points. Instead they assume that annual net migration, currently running at 330,000, will fall to 232,000 in 2017 and 185,000 by 2021. This is still far higher than Theresa Mayâ€™s declared object of getting net migration down below 100,000 a year. The OBR asked the government to detail how its post-Brexit migration policy will operate but unsurprisingly ministers did not feel able to share any further detail and so the OBR felt unable to make any lower assumption for net migration: â€œIn the absence of more policy detail and evidence of how much weaker the â€˜pullâ€™ effect (of Britain becoming a less attractive destination) we do not think it would sensible to move to a lower assumption now.â€\\x9d Drive, baby, drive - that was the message from chancellor Philip Hammondâ€™s autumn budget statement, with more money paving the way to new roads and a freeze on fuel tax. These steamroller the funds offered for electric cars. Thatâ€™s a problem, as the UK already has an air pollution crisis that causes tens of thousands of early deaths - more traffic will only make it worse. Furthermore, rising transport emissions are one of the biggest obstacles to the nation meeting its legal targets for cutting carbon emissions. But then neither climate change or the environment merited a single mention in Hammondâ€™s speech. Nor did green energy, support for which is set to fall off a cliff in 2021, or energy efficiency measures for the UKâ€™s many leaky homes. The chancellor extolled the benefits of certainty to business and Britainâ€™s expertise in â€œdisruptive technologiesâ€\\x9d, but these claims will feel very hollow to those trying to build a clean, green economy fit for the 21st century. They were almost entirely ignored. More here: British workers face a sharp earnings squeeze next year, says the OBR, as the weaker pound drives up inflation. The watchdog predicts that inflation will wipe out almost all pay rises in 2017. The fall in the pound will squeeze householdsâ€™ real incomes by pushing up import prices. We expect the poundâ€™s fall to add almost 2 per cent to the level of consumer prices over the next two years, relative to our March assumption. Real earnings growth will consequently fall close to zero next year. That squeeze is expected to hold back real private consumption growth in 2017 and 2018. Wages are currently rising by around 2.4% per year; and the OBR expects inflation to hit 2.5% in 2018 (corrected) This chart, from Torsten Bell of Resolution Foundation, shows how workers will take home Â£16 per week less than expected in 2020-21 (due to higher inflation and weaker pay growth). Thatâ€™s Â£830 per year. And in the Commons George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, told his successor that he was right to â€œkeep his powder dryâ€\\x9d (ie, not increase spending too much now) because of the risk that he might need to revive the economy in the future. He said: Can I warmly congratulate my friend and successor on a strong statement and an assured delivery. The independent OBR has given us a very sober assessment of the economic and borrowing challenges that Britain faces and the chancellor is right to keep his powder dry. In the Commons Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, told Philip Hammond that, although Hammond told the Tory conference that people did not vote for Brexit to become poorer, the OBR is saying that is exactly what they did vote for. Miliband said: [Hammond] said at the Tory party conference that the British people did not vote to become poorer. The OBR tells us on p19 that Â£58bn of the worsening in the public finances is due to the Brexit decision. Isnâ€™t it a salutary warning to us about the decisions we take in the coming months and isnâ€™t it a very strong argument for us to remain as close as possible to our largest trading area the single market and inside not outside the customs union? Hammond responded by saying that Britain would try to get the â€œclosest possible trading arrangementâ€\\x9d with the EU. One of George Osborneâ€™s most peculiar policies was his decision to give a tax break to workers who agreed to forfeit some of their employment rights. Many commentators thought it was barmy idea, but Osborne liked it because it allowed him to show Tory rightwingers that he had not completely ignored the regulation-slashing proposals in the infamous Beecroft report. Anyway, it turns out Philip Hammond thinks itâ€™s a duff idea too. It has been scrapped. This is what the autumn statement document says: The tax advantages linked to shares awarded under ESS [employee shareholder status] will be abolished for arrangements entered into on, or after, 1 December 2016. The status itself will be closed to new arrangements at the next legislative opportunity. This is in response to evidence suggesting that the status is primarily being used for tax planning instead of supporting a more flexible workforce. The OBR are now briefing economics journalists about todayâ€™s autumn statement. The watchdog is warning that Britainâ€™s economy is dogged by uncertainty, and is particularly concerned that Brexit could hurt productivity. Our colleague Katie Allen is there, and tweeting the key points: At PMQs Jeremy Corbyn demonstrated quite effectively how health spending is likely to be one of the key issues over coming years. (See 12.22pm.) But the autumn statement had more or less nothing to say on health. In his speech Philip Hammond had one sentence about the NHS, confirming that the government will back the NHS five-year forward plan. The autumn statement document does not mention the NHS at all. The word health does appear five times, but three of those are references to the health of the economy. The secretary of state for health gets one mention, and there is a single reference to the devolution of the work and health programme to city regions. The Office for Budget Responsibility will probably be accused by Brexiteers of being overly pessimistic about the economic impact of Brexit. But in its report (pdf) it says that things could get even worse than it is forecasting, because is it not assuming mass lay-offs and consumer spending drying up, even though these are both possibilities. (Weâ€™ve put the key sentence in bold.) Given the uncertainty surrounding the choices and trade-offs that the Government may have to make, and the consequences of different outcomes, we have not attempted to predict the precise end result of the negotiations. Instead we have made a judgement â€“ consistent with most external studies â€“ that over the time horizon of our forecast any likely Brexit outcome would lead to lower trade flows, lower investment and lower net inward migration than we would otherwise have seen, and hence lower potential output. In time the performance of the economy will also be affected by future choices that the Government makes about regulatory and other policies that are currently determined at the European level. These could move in either a growth-enhancing or a growth-impeding direction. In the near term, as the negotiations get under way, we assume that GDP growth will continue to slow into next year as uncertainty leads firms to delay investment and as consumers are squeezed by higher import prices, thanks to the fall in the pound. But we do not assume that firms shed jobs more aggressively or that consumers increase precautionary saving, both of which are downside risks if the path to Brexit is bumpy. The government has refused to reveal if it has made any promises to Japanese carmaker Nissan over Brexit, the Office for Budget Responsibility reveals. Todayâ€™s report shows that the OBR asked the Treasury if it had created any new â€˜contingent liabilitiesâ€™ related to Nissan. Thatâ€™s an important issue, as Nissan announced last month that it will build two new vehicles in Sunderland despite uncertainty over Britainâ€™s future with Europe. The Treasury â€œdeclined to sayâ€\\x9d, admits the OBR, even though this might threaten the accuracy of its forecasts. This means we still donâ€™t know what, if anything, has been promised to Nissan - or have any new insight into the governmentâ€™s Brexit plan. Instead of providing the OBR with useful information, the Treasury directed the OBR to one of Theresa Mayâ€™s speeches, which basically said â€œweâ€™d make a success of Brexitâ€\\x9d. This meant the OBR had to make â€œbroad-brushâ€\\x9d assumptions: Here is the Treasury paper (pdf) with the charts showing the distributional impact of the autumn statement measures. This chart, which shows the impact of autumn statement decisions in 2019-20, shows that it has been progressive, because the poor are gaining more than the rich. The Treasury says the gains are â€œmodestâ€\\x9d but those in the second decile from the bottom gain most in proportional terms. That is probably to a large extent because of the universal credit changes, which will help the working poor. But these changes are not enough to stop the governmentâ€™s overall record since 2015 being more regressive. This chart shows the distributional impact in 2019-20 of all tax, welfare and public spending changes implemented since May 2015. The richest lose most. But people in the poorest three deciles are the next biggest losers, and most gains go to the wealthiest half of the population. The Office for Budget Responsibility has done a really good job of trying to calculate the impact of the EU referendum. Thereâ€™s a whole appendix, called Annex B (p239 onwards), in which the OBR tries to construct a â€˜counterfactualâ€™ world in which Britain voted to stay in the European Union (alas, unhappy Remain voters canâ€™t migrate to it). Ands this counterfactual shows that the vote will cost Â£58bn over the next five years. Thatâ€™s because lower migration, and weaker productivity, will hit government revenues: This graph also shows that Brexit changes are the biggest contribution to the Â£122bn in extra borrowing announced today: Here are verdicts on the autumn statement from the â€™s panel, Matthew dâ€™Ancona, Martin Kettle, and Gaby Hinsliff. And here is an extract from Martinâ€™s article. Paradoxically, however, today was just about the one day when something like a budgetary statement was in order from the chancellor. Thatâ€™s because of one thing alone â€“ Brexit. Hammondâ€™s statement was a chance to make a first big assessment of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. The verdict is, without question, bleak. Growth is down, borrowing has to rise, and the dream of a surplus has been deferred to â€œas soon as practicableâ€\\x9d, ie never. Hammondâ€™s other big problem is that tax take is falling. All those references in his speech to sustaining the tax base are Treasury code for the fact that Britain has continued to become a low wage, tax avoiding and increasingly unequal economy since 2010, in which thereâ€™s not enough public money to pay for public spending. That demands either more taxes or less spending, or both. Hammond has allowed himself to be boxed in on both options. But he gave a very important signal that pensions â€“ and, less importantly in budgetary terms, the aid budget â€“ will be cut after 2020, and the pension triple lock will be broken. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, responded to the autumn statement for Labour. Here are the key points from his speech. McDonnell said the autumn statement showed that George Osborneâ€™s â€œlong-term economic planâ€\\x9d was a failure. Todayâ€™s statement places on record the abject failure of the last six wasted years and offers no hope for the future. Weâ€™ve heard today thereâ€™ll be more taxes, more debt and more borrowing. The verdict could not be clearer - the so-called long-term economic plan has failed. As the Treasuryâ€™s own leaked paper revealed, the government knew it had failed before the referendum result was announced. He said the government was not equipped to face Brexit. We now face Brexit, the greatest economic challenge of a generation, and we face it unprepared and ill-equipped. He said the â€œnational living wageâ€\\x9d increase was less than expected under Osborne. He urged Hammond to face up to the â€œextreme Brexit fanaticsâ€\\x9d in the cabinet and insist on Britain keeping tariff-free access to the single market. The chancellor must now do the right thing for British workers and businesses. He must insist on full, tariff-free access to the single market. He and the Treasury know thatâ€™s what will give the best deal for jobs and prosperity here. It may not be in the chancellorâ€™s nature, but in the national interest I urge him to stand up to the prime minister and the extreme Brexit fanatics in her cabinet. He claimed that Labour cared more about the â€œJamsâ€\\x9d, those just about managing, than the Tories. We have had a month of briefings from the party opposite on those people who are called just about managing - the Jams. To the party opposite these people are just an electoral demographic. To us they are our friends, our neighbours and the people we represent. He called for the reintroduction of the 50p top rate of tax. He said the cuts to universal credit should be abandoned altogether. He called for more spending on social care. Many elderly people will remain trapped in their homes, isolated and lonely, lacking the care they need because of these continuing cuts to social care. You canâ€™t cut social care without also hitting the NHS. He claimed the govenrment had no new ideas. There are just no new ideas here, just a promise to deliver what they previously failed to deliver on. This is press release policy-making and not provision. All we need now is the return of the hi-vis jacket. The fourth industrial revolution will not be delivered on delays, on old news and re-announcements. Iain Wright MP has spotted that the OBR fears UK economic productivity could be weaker after Brexit: Brexit may mean Brexit, but for the OBR it also means a major headache when it has tried to assess the likely path of the UK economy. Like the rest of us, it doesnâ€™t know what deal Britain will get - hard, soft, smooth, or something else entirely. So it has had to guess what the post-Brexit world will mean, and concluded that: ...any likely Brexit outcome would lead to lower trade flows, lower investment and lower net inward migration than we would otherwise have seen, and hence lower potential output. And here are the central assumptions underpinning the OBRâ€™s forecasts: that the UK leaves the EU in April 2019 â€“ two years after the date by which the Prime Minister has stated that Article 50 will be invoked; that the negotiation of new trading arrangements with the EU and others slows the pace of import and export growth for the next 10 years. that the UK adopts a tighter migration regime than that currently in place, but not sufficiently tight to reduce net inward migration to the desired â€˜tens of thousandsâ€™ Philip Hammond is setting aside almost Â£0.5bn to help the civil service prepare for Brexit, the autumn statement document reveals. Here is the key paragraph, 3.34. Weâ€™ve highlighted the key sentence in bold. Additional resource will be provided to strengthen trade policy capability in the Department for International Trade (DIT) and Foreign and Commonwealth Office, totalling Â£26 million a year by 2019-20. There will also be additional resource of up to Â£51 million in 2016-17 for the Department for Exiting the European Union to support the re-negotiation of the UKâ€™s relationship with the European Union. Up to Â£94 million a year of additional resource will be allocated from 2017-18 until the UKâ€™s exit is complete. In total this will mean up to Â£412 million of additional funding over the course of this Parliament. The next time a Conservative politician talks about getting the debt under control, direct them to page 14 of the OBRâ€™s economic and fiscal outlook. It shows that Britainâ€™s national debt is expected to hit Â£1.945trn by 2019-20, the end of the current parliament, and continue climbing to Â£1.952trn by 2021-22. And here is the key table from the autumn statement document (pdf) - the scorecard, saying what the various measures in the statement cost, or raise in revenue. Hereâ€™s that OBR scorecard in full: You can find all the autumn statement documents here, on the Treasury website. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has just released its verdict. And it rules that Philip Hammond has delivered a â€˜modest giveawayâ€™, alongside a decidedly weaker economic landscape. The ONS says: The Chancellor has relaxed his fiscal targets to make space for a modest infrastructure spending giveaway over the next five years. A weaker outlook for the economy and tax revenues â€“ and these new spending commitments â€“ mean that the budget is no longer expected to return to surplus in this Parliament, with a Â£21 billion deficit remaining in 2020-21. The OBR also pins some of the blame on the uncertainty created by Brexit: Public sector net borrowing is now expected to fall more slowly than we forecast in March, primarily reflecting weak tax receipts so far this year and a more subdued outlook for economic growth as the UK negotiates a new relationship with the European Union. The OBR also reports that Hammond has failed to hit any of George Osborneâ€™s old targets, but is now on track to meet his new fiscal targets (a budget surplus in the next parliament, the debt/GDP ratio falling by the end of this parliament, and a welfare cap). More here: Autumn Statement 2016: fiscal targets relaxed to allow modest giveaway We were promised a sober, gimmick-free autumn statement from Philip Hammond and, appropriately enough, the main surprise at the end of Hammondâ€™s speech was an announcement that he is abolishing the Treasuryâ€™s biannual tax-and-spend bonanza. It was Gordon Brown who created the autumn statement in its modern form, a budget in all but name, and most economists and governance experts will agree with Hammond about these being unnecessary, because governments do not need to re-write the tax code every six months. MPs laughed, though, when Hammond announced this because it is clear that next year we will get two budgets, and after that we will a â€œspring statementâ€\\x9d that may over time morph into an alternative budget. Most of the positive announcements in the statement had been flagged up well in advance, but it sounded as if some of his revenue-raising measures will be more significant than MPs realised. Graeme and I will be delving into the small print shortly. And there was also an intriguing reference to the ageing population, and the need to review budgets after 2020, which sounded like the death knell to the triple lock. Weâ€™re collecting all the key points from Hammondâ€™s statement here: Hammond says this autumn statement responds to the challenges the country faces. It responds to the challenge of the country living beyond its means. And it provides helps to those who need it. And thatâ€™s it. Hammond has finished. Hammond says this is his first autumn statement - and his last. He is abolishing the autumn statement. No other major economy makes hundreds of changes every year. Next yearâ€™s spring budget will be the final spring budget. After that there will be an autumn budget, well before the new financial year starts. And then there will be a spring statement, responding to the forecasts from the OBR, but no major fiscal event. He says he will not make significant changes twice a year just for the sake of it. This brings the UK into line with best practice, recommended by the IMF and others. Hammond says he is cancelling the proposed fuel duty rise for the seventh successive year. This will save the average driver Â£130 a year, and the average van driver Â£350 a year. Hammond says the government will consider measures to help savers. It is proposing a savers bond for them. It will pay 2.2% interest. Hammond turns to letting agents. Their fees have spiralled, despite attempts to regulate them. This is wrong, he says. The government will ban fees for tenants. And it will ban pension cold-calling, he says. Hammond says he can go further to help families on low wages. Universal credit is an important reform, he says. He says, having considered arguments from Iain Duncan-Smith, David Burrowes and others, he has decided to cut the taper rate. That is effectively a tax cut worth Â£700m by 2022. Philip Hammond managed a rare trick in his first autumn statement -- he made the UK economy look even worse than we feared. Britainâ€™s Brexit black hole is at least Â£122bn -- even larger than the Â£100bn that the City was expecting. Thatâ€™s the difference between the deficit forecasts announced in March, and the new, higher, borrowing numbers unveiled today. It means the Office for Budget Responsibilities is expecting the economy to weaken as the Brexit negotiations intensify. It also reflects the cost of the infrastructure pledges which Hammond has made -- and explains why he couldnâ€™t produce more rabbits from the Treasury hat. The goal of a surplus in 2020 has been kicked deep into the long grass. Hammond is now saying it wonâ€™t happen until sometime in the NEXT parliament. That could be 2024-2025 -- a whole decade later than George Osborneâ€™s original plan. Hereâ€™s the grisly details of how much Britain now has to borrow. 2016-2017: Â£68.2bn deficit, up from Â£55.5bn in the Budget in March 2017-2018: Â£59bn, up from Â£38.8bn 2018-2019: Â£46.5bn up from Â£21.4bn 2019-2020: Â£21.9bn compared with a surplus of Â£10.4bn 2020-2021: Â£20.7bn compared with a surplus of Â£11bn Surprisingly, the growth figures werenâ€™t quite as bad as we feared. Thereâ€™s a sharp slowdown in 2017, but not a recession. And then weâ€™re back to trend growth in a few year. However, that is all dependent on how the economy copes with the Brexit negotiations. 2016: 2.1% growth, up from 2.0% forecast in the Budget in March 2017: 1.4%, down from 2.2% 2018: 1.7%, down from 2.1% 2019: 2.1%, matching the 2.1% forecast in March 2020: 2.0%, down from 2.1% Thatâ€™s why Britainâ€™s economy will be 2.4% smaller than if weâ€™d voted to stay in the European Union. Labour area already calling it Tory economic failure: Hammond says the government has given a pay rise to low-paid workers through the â€œnational living wageâ€\\x9d. He says he is making capital available for new grammar schools. But more needs to be done, he says. The â€œnational living wageâ€\\x9d will increase from Â£7.20 per hour to Â£7.50 in April next year. Hammond turns to the personal allowance. It will rise to Â£11,500 in April, he says. Since 2010 28m people have had their income tax cut, and 4m people have been taken out of income tax altogether. He says the government is still committed to taking the allowance up to Â£12,500 by the end of this parliament. And the 40p threshold will rise to Â£50,000 over the same period. Hammond says the government has done more than any other to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. The tax gap is one of the lowest in the world, he says. He says there will be a new penalty for people who use a tax avoidance scheme HMRC closes down. All these tax avoidance measures will save Â£2bn over the forecast period, he says. Hammond says from April 2017 employers and employees who use benefits in kind schemes will pay the same tax as everyone else. But there will be exceptions, including for childcare and cycling. Hammond says insurance premium tax will rise from 10% to 12% And he says the government will change the rules on whiplash compensation, saving drivers Â£40 a year on average. Hammond says he wants Britain to remain the number one destination for business. He knows how much business values certainty. So the government will stick to the business tax plans set out in the March budget. He says the communities secretary will lower the transitional relief cap. Thatâ€™s complicated, but itâ€™s good news, he says. And rural rate relief will be increase to 100%, giving businesses in rural areas a boost. He says the government will keep its commitments to protect budgets it said it would protect. But in the next parliament it will have to tackle the challenges of an ageing population. So budgets will be reviewed at the next spending review. Hammond says, having run two big spending departments, he came to this job with fixed views on departmental spending. He wants Â£1bn from savings to be refocused in priority areas. Hammond says public spending has a proportion of GDP has fallen to 40%. He says the government has demonstrated that controlling spending is compatible with having world-class services. Departmental spending limits will remain in place. And in 2021-22 they will rise with inflation. But the Ministry of Justice will get extra funding for another 2,500 prison officers. Hammond says Â£102 money from Libor fines will be distribute to service charities. And money from the Tampon tax fund will go to womenâ€™s charities. Hammond says he has deliberately avoided making this statement a list of specific projects. But he can announce a plan to protect Wentworth Woodhouse near Rotherham, a model for the house in Jane Austenâ€™s Pride and Prejudice. The government will provide a Â£7.5m grant to help preserve this piece of northern heritage, he says. Hammond says devolution remains at the governmentâ€™s approach. A new city deal for Stirling is being negotiated. This means every city in Scotland will be on course to have one. City regions will get new borrowing powers, he says. London will get Â£3.15bn for 90,000 affordable homes. And the adult education budget will be devolved to London. Former Labour advisor Baron Wood tweets: Hammond says for too long investment has been focused on London. No other major economy has such a gap between the productivity of its capital, and its other cities. He says the government will publish a strategy to address this. An evaluation will allow the east Midlands rail hub to go ahead. Hammond says this investment will provide the backbone to the governmentâ€™s industrial strategy. He will double UK Exportâ€™s financial capacity. He will take a step towards the problem of UK start-ups being snapped up by larger competitors by investing Â£400m, with a view to unlocking Â£1bn of investment. Hammond says he has written to the National Infrastructure Commission asking for proposals for spending in the next decade. The govenrment will commit to spending between 1% and 1.2% of GDP from 2020 on economic infrastructure. By comparison, it is spending 0.8% now, he says. The UK needs world-class digital infrastructure. He wants the UK to be a world-leader in 5G, he says. More than Â£1bn will be invested in digital infrastructure. From April there will be100% business rates relief on investment in new fibre. Hammond says the transport secretary will set out more details over the coming weeks. Hammond says there will be an extra Â£1.1bn invested in English transport networks, where small investments can often achieve big wins. Some of this will go on rail, which Jeremy Corbyn will welcome, he says. Hammond says for many the goal of home ownership remains out of reach. The challenge of delivering housing where it is not affordable is not a new one. But this is an urgent challenge. The government will soon publish a housing white paper. Often the local impact in infrastructure is an obstacle to new housing. So infrastructure spending will be focused where it can encourage new development. He says he can also announce new funding for housing. He wants a housing market that works for everyone, he says. Hammond says the government will form a new national productivity investment fund worth Â£23bn. It will focus on innovation and infrastructure. Investment in R&D will rise by Â£2bn a year by 2020. He says in the autumn statement he will prioritise high-value investment in infrastructure. He says the governmentâ€™s hard-won credibility on spending means it can fund this from extra borrowing, while funding everything else in the statement from taxation and spending cuts. The UK lags the US and Germany by 30 points in productivity, he says. This means it takes a German worker four days to make what a British worker makes in five, he says. That means longer hours and lower pay for British workers. Here are three fiscal rules which Hammond has just proposed: Hammond jokes about the representations he has received from Labour. And he has received representations from other bodies, he says. Debt will peak at over 90% of GDP, he says. Hammond announces the borrowing figures. It will be Â£68.2bn this year, and Â£59bn next year, he says. Then the figures are: 2018-19 - Â£46bn 2019-20 - Â£21bn 2020-21 - Â£20.7bn 2021-22 - Â£17.2bn He says borrowing will be 3.5% this year, falling to 0.7% by 2021-22. Hammond says the govenrment does not expect to balance the budget by 2020. It is publishing new rules. There are three of them. 1 - To get the budget in surplus in the next parliament, and borrowing down to 2% by the end of this parliament. 2 - To get net debt falling by the end of this parliament. 3 - To keep welfare spending below a limit Hammond turns to the forecasts. Since 2010 the OBR has done forecasts. He says growth is forecast to be 2.1% this year, and 1.4% in 2017. That is due to lower investment and weaker demand, and those are caused by greater uncertainty and higher inflation. The other growth forecasts are: 2018 - 1.7% 2019 - 2.1% 2020 - 2.1% 2021 - 2% Hammond says, over the forecast period, growth is expected to be 2.4% lower than forecast as a result of Brexit. Hamond pays tribute to George Osborne. He says he will be no better at proving rabbits from hats (Osborneâ€™s speciality) than Boris Johnson is at retrieve balls from the back of scrums (a joke about Johnson not becoming prime minister.) Hammond says the Brexit decision makes more urgent than ever the need to tackle the economyâ€™s weaknesses. He says the government resolves to confront those challenges head on. It wants an economy that works for everyone, and where every part of the country is part of national success. Philip Hammond rises to make his statement. (John Bercow points out he is also first secretary of state, as well as chancellor.) Hammond says employment is at a record high. The economy has bounced back, and shown resilience since the EU referendum vote five months today. The Conservative Charlie Elphicke asks about fuel duty. Fuel prices go up like a rocket, when the oil price rises, but fall like a feather when it goes down, he says. May says Elphicke should wait for the autumn statement. Asked to rule out any more referendums this parliament, May ruled out a second referendum on the EU. But she did not rule out a second referendum on Scottish independence (although she has in the past said she is not in favour of one). May says austerity is about living within our means. When we talk about support for the homeless, we must remember that taxpayers pay for that support, she says. And many of them are struggling. John Whittingdale, the Conservative former culture secretary, welcomes the expected Â£1bn for superfast broadband in the autumn statement. May says investment in this field is crucial. At least three former chancellors are in the Commons to watch Philip Hammondâ€™s debut fiscal statement: ITVâ€™s Robert Peston can see the funny side of #AutumnStatement. From Skyâ€™s Beth Rigby This is a sign that todayâ€™s autumn statement might be less dramatic than usual: PMQs - Snap verdict: That exchange will be overshadowed by the autumn statement coming soon, but thatâ€™s a shame for Jeremy Corbyn because that was one of his best ever PMQs performances. He sounded passionate and focused, and, although Theresa May sounded confident when defending measures to combat health tourism (in response to Corbynâ€™s fifth question) her answers on the topic of social care sounded bland and unsatisfactory. One problem was that she did not engage emotionally with Corbynâ€™s questions, and instead, sounding like an accountant, kept going on about government initiatives like the â€œBetter Care Fundâ€\\x9d which mean little to most listeners. Corbyn sounded a lot more authentic. Interestingly, he also at least twice defended the record of the Blair/Brown governments (on health spending, and on setting up the CQC), which is not something you always hear from Corbyn at PMQs. Doubtless some Labour MPs will assume that there is a link between that and the way this afternoon he scored a decisive win. Corbyn says the home in the Panorama programme was understaffed. He says poorly-paid staff should not be blamed. A warning from the CQC is not enough. Has the government considered the impact of getting patients to have to take their passports to hospitals to get care. Some 9.5m people do not have passports. May says over the course of this parliament the government will be spending Â£500bn. She says there has been a problem with people turning up to access services but not paying for them. Corbyn says Sir Simon Stevens said recently the next few years would be the toughest for NHS spending. At some point health spending per person will be cut for the first time. There are fewer mental health nurses. Waiting times are getting longer. And 1m people are not getting the social care they need. Shouldnâ€™t social care be properly funded? May says billions of pounds extra are going into the NHS. There is a record level of money going into mental health. What Corbyn forgets to mention is that we can only afford to pay for the NHS if we have a strong economy creating wealth. That is what we will hear from the chancellor in a few moments. Corbyn say health spending trebled under Labour. And levels of satisfaction reached a record high. He says the number of people in hospital because of lack of care has gone up by one third. May repeats what the government has done. She asks which government put the triple lock in place for pensioners. Corbyn says the precept is a drop in the ocean compared to what is necessary. MPs will have been appalled by this weekâ€™s Panorama about a care scandal. He asks what the goverment will do to protect residents in the homes featured. May says everyone is appalled by terrible treatment like this. The CQC is able to step in, she says. But there is more that can be done, she says. The care minister will write to the CQC to see what more can be done. Jeremy Corbyn asks about the governments plans for the NHS, which he says hide cuts worth Â£22bn, according to the BMA. He says the BMAâ€™s Mark Porter says this is a mess. Where is he wrong? Theresa May says savings will be reinvested within the NHS. The government is providing not just Â£8bn for the NHS, but Â£10bn. Corbyn points out that the health committee says the figure is Â£4.5bn, not Â£10bn. He says more than 1m people do not get the social care they need. There has been an increase in admissions from older patient. Margaret wrote to him about how her mother suffered two falls because of lack of care. What is the government doing to improve social care. May says the government has introduced the Better Care Fund and a social precept for local authorities. What did Labour do? They said they would deal with social care in the 1997 manifesto. There were various reviews, but by 2009 they were still on a green paper. Thirteen years and they did nothing. From the Spectatorâ€™s Isabel Hardman PMQs has started. This is from the Evening Standardâ€™s Kate Proctor. The devolved government in Belfastâ€™s Finance Minister has called for a â€œNiagra Falls stimulusâ€\\x9d of extra infrastructure spending for Northern Ireland in the region. MÃ¡irtÃ\\xadn Ã“ Muilleoir, the Sinn Fein Minister, said the government needs to invest in infrastructure â€œto give the economy a jolt.â€\\x9d The Minister also called today for â€œausterity to be binned.â€\\x9d Northern Ireland expects to gain an extra Â£40 million from the Chancellorâ€™s autumn statement, which will be invested in improved road, rail and other local infrastructure. This is from the Sunâ€™s Steve Hawkes. PMQs will be starting shortly. We will be covering the Theresa May/Jeremy Corbyn exchanges, and any autumn statement related questions, but not the whole thing. As the former Labour adviser Theo Bertram says, PMQs before the autumn statement is normally a bit of a non-event. One of the Cityâ€™s leading fund managers, Toby Nangle of Columbia Threadneedle, hopes that Philip Hammond will produce new measures to boost investment. He tells Sky News that: The real issue of concern for us is the investment side. With Brexit looming over, the surveys have been pointing down. So anything he can do on that side would be quite helpful. Nangle believes the government should exclude infrastructure spending from its budget surplus targets. This would allow it to invest in long-term projects that boost productivity (and growth) in the long term, without having to slash day-to-day spending. Labour have been pushing this idea for years - and Nangle says it makes sense: A shift away from targeting actual budget surpluses to primary surpluses is a very sensible thing that most people will support. It facilitates investment - and that investment is really what we need as a country. It stops you pitting your health budget against your HS2 budget out of the same pot. Here is ITVâ€™s political editor, Robert Peston, on the autumn statement. Theresa May has welcomed Philip Hammondâ€™s â€œprudentâ€\\x9d approach to running Britainâ€™s economy as he prepares to deliver his first autumn statement, reviving a favourite catchphrase of Gordon Brownâ€™s. Hammond set out his plans for his first set-piece parliamentary event as chancellor to his fellow ministers at Wednesday morningâ€™s cabinet meeting. He is expected to announce sharply weaker economic forecasts and reveal the full extent of the deterioration in the public finances likely to be caused by Britainâ€™s exit from the European Union. The Treasury has already announced a series of modest giveaways, including a partial reversal of deep cuts to in-work benefits. The chancellor is expected to confirm a ban on letting fees for millions of families who are being charged hundreds of pounds by agencies to cover the supposed administrative costs of renting. Hammond is also expected to announce an increase in the â€œnational living wageâ€\\x9d from Â£7.20 to Â£7.50 an hour from April 2017, although this is slightly below the Â£7.60 figure that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates would be necessary for it to stay on course to match the pledge of Â£9 an hour by 2020. Hammond told colleagues his approach was â€œfocused on preparing and supporting the economy as we write a new chapter in the countryâ€™s historyâ€\\x9d, and on tackling the productivity shortfall which means Britainâ€™s workers are â€œworking longer hours, for less payâ€\\x9d, compared to similar countries. Hammondâ€™s colleagues, as is traditional, banged the table in approval of his plans, the spokeswoman said. Fiscal prudence, and tackling Britainâ€™s long-term productivity shortfall, were key themes of the Treasuryâ€™s work during Brownâ€™s stint as chancellor. Mayâ€™s spokeswoman also highlighted the fact that Hammondâ€™s colleagues had welcomed the way he and Treasury officials had worked constructively with other departments; and the renewed focus on the long-term weaknesses of the economy. Hammond has consciously sought to reject the meddling approach of former chancellors, and insiders say he will allow his colleagues more leeway over how they spend their budgets. He is also expected to deliver a slimmed-down statement, with few gimmicks. This is what Theresa May told the cabinet about the autumn statement, according to Number 10. This is an autumn statement which will deliver on the governmentâ€™s commitment to build an economy which works for everyone and sets the economy on the right path for the long term. This is a balanced and prudent autumn statement which will make clear Britain is open for business and the government is on the side of ordinary working people struggling to make ends meet. That really was a muted appearance by Philip Hammond on Downing Street; he looked more like a man heading to the shops for some milk than a chancellor preparing to update the nation on its finances.... Sky Newsâ€™ Faisal Islam hoped for a bit more... It may be a sign that Hammond isnâ€™t planning any fireworks today, and may be keen to downplay the importance of the autumn statement. Here is another profile of Philip Hammond, from Newsnightâ€™s Nicholas Watt. Itâ€™s very good, but it contains rather more information about the teenage Hammond than we need to know. Apparently he was a good kisser. It also contains this insight into what Hammond thinks of Boris Johnson and Liam Fox. Philip Hammond has just emerged from Number 11 Downing Street, clutching a copy of autumn statement. But heâ€™s not hanging around for photos -- the chancellor heads straight to his ministerial limo for the short drive to the House of Commons. The chancellor tweets.... As well as reading your comments below the line weâ€™d like to hear from readers who will be affected by the chancellorâ€™s announcements today via a dedicated callout. Is your family â€œjust managingâ€\\x9d or are you a pensioner struggling to get by? Maybe you earn close to the governmentâ€™s â€œnational living wageâ€\\x9d and have comments on its implications for you? Tell us what the autumn statement will do for you by clicking on the link â€“ you can share your story anonymously if you prefer â€“ and weâ€™ll use a selection in our ongoing coverage. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, has been tweeting about the Treasuryâ€™s decision to change the taper rates to ameliorate the impact of universal credit cuts. The Resolution Foundation is a thinktank set up to investigate the problems facing low and middle earners - or LMEs, as they used to be called. They are more or less exactly the same group now called â€œJamsâ€\\x9d by the government - people just about managing. The governmentâ€™s decision to target the JAMs has sparked a spread of new acronyms to capture modern Britainâ€™s tribes. Freelance journalist Jane Merrick is leading the charge, with a series of groups that every serious politician should be targeting: The Curds wonâ€™t be crying many tears for Foxtonsâ€™ shareholders today.... Still, it could be worse... Jeremy Corbyn has been tweeting about the autumn statement. Labour have just published some prebuttal of the autumn statement. They say that poorer families will still be worse off, even if Philip Hammond cut the taper rate on universal credit, from 65p to 63p in the pound (meaning families lose less benefits if they do more paid work). Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says: â€œSome working families, who will have lost as much as Â£2,500 a year, might only be getting back as little as Â£150 in this Statement. And hereâ€™s the maths: Following the changes to the UC taper rate, a working couple with two children, both working on the National Living Wage (NLW), could now be Â£800 worse off instead of around Â£1,100 worse off in 2017-18 as a result of cuts to UC work allowances. Following the changes to the UC taper rate, a lone parent with two children earning Â£25,000 per annum might be around Â£2,300 worse off instead of Â£2,500 worse off in 2017-18 as a result of cuts to UC work allowances. Roughly Â£50m has been wiped off the combined value of Foxtons and Countrywide this morning. Both companyâ€™s shares are still down sharply today, thanks to the looming clampdown on tenancy fees. This rather undermines the claim that these fees arenâ€™t a lucrative source of easy income for estate agents. Here is another of the pictures that Philip Hammond posed for yesterday, for use in advance of todayâ€™s autumn statement. Like the one at 8.50am, it seems intended to convey a sense of calm poise. And it is no surprise to see that Hammond is a tidy desk man. This is what Kate Allen and George Parker say about him in a Financial Times profile (subscription). Mrs May is Mr Hammondâ€™s most important cabinet ally, but their relationship is less close than the one shared by David Cameron and Mr Osborne. â€œThey donâ€™t meet three to four times a day, they meet three to four times a week,â€\\x9d one Hammond staffer said. â€œIt is a more formal relationship but they are both very formal kinds of people. He is not a casual feet-up-on-the-table kind of guy, heâ€™s the type of man who wears suits on aeroplanes.â€\\x9d The FT article also contains an interesting line about how Hammond has changed the way decisions are made in the Treasury. Political decision-making has long operated through the red box system: civil servants prepare briefing papers of a couple of pages or more in length that are packed up and sent home to be read overnight, with ministerial decisions handed down in the following day or two. But the new chancellor demanded much shorter briefings, delivered to him two or three times a day for rapid decisions. Although he still uses red boxes, it has made the Treasuryâ€™s operations â€œmuch quickerâ€\\x9d says one senior civil servant who works closely with Mr Hammond â€œand the volume of decision making is higherâ€\\x9d, while â€œthe civil service has had to make its updates shorter and more succinctâ€\\x9d. The pound has dropped this morning as the City braces for the governmentâ€™s new growth and deficit forecasts. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.237, its lowest level of the week. The pound has also dipped against the euro, at â‚¬1.165. Traders are nervous about the likely impact of leaving the EU on the public finances. So sterling could get a kicking if the growth figures are particularly bleak, or if the deterioration in the public finances is even more than the Â£100bn expected. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: It has become evident that Sterling remains trapped by the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, with the future of the post-Brexit UK economy haunting investors. Among those welcoming the governmentâ€™s decision to ban letting agent fees is Olly Grender, the Lib Dem peer who has been pushing a private memberâ€™s bill through the Lords proposing just this. Here is an extract from her second reading speech explaining the case for a ban. Unlike people in the owner-occupied market, one in four renters moved home in 2013-14. Just under a third of renters have moved three times or more in the past five years, and just under a quarter of them in London. Each time they move, the up-front costs are often the greatest barrier of all ... Costs vary from agent to agent and range from Â£40 to Â£780, with the average cost just under Â£400 per move. Many of those charges seem completely arbitrary. A credit check, for example, costs about Â£25 today, but some agencies charge a tenant Â£150 or more to carry one out. Marta, a lady who contacted the Debriefâ€™s Make Renting Fair campaign, had asked to sign a three-year tenancy agreement. The agent said, â€œFine, but youâ€™ll have to pay three times the feeâ€\\x9d: that was three times Â£360 just to re-sign. I spoke to a young woman this week who is in a two-bedroom flat. She is the main tenant and happily paid Â£150 for an inventory check and other things at the start of her tenancy, but every time her flatmate changes, the new tenant is charged a Â£150 for an inventory check which, of course, never happensâ€”what a rip off! Citizens Advice, which in the past year has seen 80,000 people with a problem in the private rented sector, has seen an 8% increase in complaints about letting agents. One tenant described a fee of Â£180 to renew a tenancy agreement that is staying exactly the same, except for a change of dates. It requires a simple printing or photocopying job, and it is the renters who go into the office and sign the form, but they are charged almost Â£200 for it. And this is what she said about the argument that a ban would result in rents being increased. (See 9.37am.) Fees for tenants have already been successfully banned in Scotland following legislation in 1984, which was clarified in 2012. Research into its impact commissioned by Shelter shows that it has had only minimal side-effects for letting agents, landlords and renters, and the sector remains healthy. Only 17% of letting agents increased fees to landlords, and only 24% reported a small negative effect on their business. Not one agency manager interviewed said it had a large negative impact on their business, while 17% said they considered the change to be positive for their business. Weâ€™re expecting Philip Hammond to announce several billion pounds of infrastructure spending, including: Housebuilding: A Â£1.4bn â€œinjectionâ€\\x9d to support the building of 40,000 homes. Transport: A Â£1.3bn road improvement scheme will aim to tackle bottlenecks and fix potholes. Digital: A Â£1bn scheme will push ahead with trials for 5G mobile access and superfast one gigabit broadband. BHP Billiton economist Sukhdeep Dhillon says that Britain needs this injection of spending: But.... Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics points out that the government had been planning to squeeze public sector investment over the next few years: Hereâ€™s our full list of what to watch out for today: Ed Miliband lost the 2015 general election but today he will have the pleasure of seeing one of his proposals becoming government policy. Labourâ€™s manifesto called for a ban on letting agent fees, which it said would save renters more than Â£600. He has welcomed the fact that Philip Hammond has now adopted the idea, but wants the government to go further. At the time of the election the Conservatives said a ban on letting agent fees would â€œlead to higher rentsâ€\\x9d and Gavin Barwell, the housing minister, was making exactly the same argument just two months ago. Iain Duncan Smith, who resigned as work and pensions secretary earlier this year after the budget because he objected to the way George Osborne, the then chancellor, was cutting universal credit while offering tax cuts to higher earners, has been urging ministers to scrap those cuts to universal credit, which are worth Â£3.4bn. On the Today programme this morning he gave a cautious welcome to the news that the Treasury will ameliorate the impact of those cuts, by reducing the taper rate. But he said he wanted the government to go further. I consider this really a down payment - this is not game over. This is really about the fact the chancellor has said, given the circumstances and given that we donâ€™t know where we are going to be, necessarily, as we get into Brexit stuff over the next two years, he wants to give a strong indication that they want to help those who are struggling. Hereâ€™s a starter for this, letâ€™s see where we go over the next two to three years. The news that Philip Hammond will announce a rise in the minimum wage to Â£7.50 per hour from April 2017 has received a subdued welcome. Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, argues that workers need more help: â€œWe welcome any pay rise for low-paid workers, especially now in these uncertain times with speculations about food and other prices set to rise. The reality, however, is that a fifth of UK workers arenâ€™t paid enough to live on. Thereâ€™s still a gap between the Government minimum and our real Living Wage of 8.45 in the UK and 9.75 in London, which is based on what families need to earn to meet everyday costs.â€\\x9d And the FTâ€™s Jim Pickard points out that the Low Pay Commission had expected a bigger rise, to keep pace with average earnings. However, wage growth this year has been more muted than expected. [The governmentâ€™s target is to lift the living wage to 60% of median earnings by 2020]. Hammond may insist heâ€™s trying to help those of us who are â€˜Just about Managingâ€™. But any new dollops of help for the Jams will be wiped away by the impact of the governmentâ€™s existing austerity measures. Todayâ€™s Editorial explains: Before leaving No 11 this summer, George Osborne planned Â£13bn in benefit cuts and a further Â£16bn taken out of the budgets of â€œunprotectedâ€\\x9d Whitehall departments. He also slashed spending for local councils. Given his ambition to balance the budget (by some as yet unspecified date), Mr Hammond is unlikely to drop any of those plans. So a working family that will earn a slightly higher minimum wage and a bit more next year on their universal credit will still have their tax credits frozen for the rest of this decade; their Sure Start centres will face the threat of closure and many of their childrenâ€™s clubs and libraries could go to the wall. If Theresa May considers this helping, her version of hurting doesnâ€™t bear thinking about. Weâ€™ve pulled together some key charts to get you up to speed ahead of the autumn statement: Last night, the Treasury released a series of picture of Philip Hammond perusing the autumn statement in a comfy armchair - and curiously perched by a window. It reminded Baron Wood of Anfield, former advisor to Gordon Brown, of happier days: George Osborne has tweeted Hammond his support from the back benches: Philip Hammondâ€™s plan to clamp down on letting fees has sent shares in Britainâ€™s property sector tumbling. Foxtons shares plunged by 10% at the start of trading, with Countrywide (Britainâ€™s biggest estate agent) shedding 5% and LSL Property down 6%. Traders are calculating that these companies will lose out once Hammond bans agencies from charging large fees, typically hundreds of pounds, to cover the â€˜administrative costsâ€™ of renting properties. Hammondâ€™s plan, which will be announced in the autumn statement, follows pressure from campaigners who say tenants are simply being ripped off. But itâ€™s been damned as â€œdraconianâ€\\x9d by the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA), who argue that estate agents will charge landlords more, and theyâ€™ll pass those costs onto tenants... Exactly five months after the EU referendum, weâ€™re finally going to get the first official estimate of the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK economy. And it may be a worrying picture. Economists are certain that Philip Hammond will tear up the forecasts announced by George Osborne in Marchâ€™s budget. Growth in 2017 could be revised to just 1.4% (or lower), down from 2.2%, which would be the biggest downgrade since the eurozone crisis. Lower growth means a higher deficit -- City number-crunchers believe Hammond could announce one hundred billion pounds of extra borrowing over the next few years. It could even be more, depending what the independent Office for Budget Responsibility makes of the uncertainty facing the UK economy. And that means one of the planks of Osbornomics, a surplus by the end of the parliament, will be consigned to history. Instead of a surplus in 2019-20, Britain could find itself looking to borrow Â£30bn to balance the books in three yearâ€™s time. This chart, from Bloomberg, shows the current City forecasts for borrowing (in blue), versus the Budget predictions: This yearâ€™s goal of cutting the deficit to Â£55bn is almost certainly toast. Yesterdayâ€™s public finance figures showed that Britain has already borrowed Â£48bn since April, with five months until the end of the financial year This likely deterioration in the public finances means that Hammond wonâ€™t have the option of big fiscal giveaways to boost growth. Instead, heâ€™ll probably favour smaller-scale projects which should deliver obvious, and quick, economic gains - such as new road and rail infrastructure. But thereâ€™s no doubt that Hammond has a tough job today. Something odd happened in Westminster yesterday. At around 1pm political journalists started getting an email from the Treasury with a press release headed â€œChancellor delivers on government pledge to support ordinary working class familiesâ€\\x9d. There is nothing unusual about the government briefing out selected titbits from the autumn statement and the budget in advance. But this read like The Full Monty: a Â£1.4bn affordable housing announcement, a (modest) increase in the â€œnational minimum wageâ€\\x9d, a measure to reduce the impact of planned cuts to universal credit (but only slightly), a ban on letting agentsâ€™ fees, tighter whiplash compensation rules intended to reduce the cost of car insurance by Â£40 a year, and investment in research and development. It was so comprehensive that we spent the rest of the day wondering - what on earth is left for Philip Hammond to announce this afternoon? Weâ€™ve been told that Hammond doesnâ€™t approve of the meretricious showmanship that his predecessors George Osborne and Gordon Brown used to display on these occasions and so it seems very unlikely that he will unveil a surprise â€œrabbit out of the hatâ€\\x9d in the final sentence of his statement. Instead many of us assume that the Treasury released all the good news last night because they know todayâ€™s statement will be dominated by the forecasts for growth and government tax receipts, which are expected to show that Brexit will blast a massive hole in the governmentâ€™s finances. The economy has been performing reasonably well in the five months since the EU referendum. But, for the first time since that vote, the government will have to make a formal assessment of the longterm impact of Brexit and there are suspicions that the figures will be so gloomy that they will read as if they have been drafted by Remoaner HQ. Hammond does not have a lot of room for manoeuvre. But Theresa May replaced David Cameron in the summer promising a renewed focus on those who are â€œjust about managingâ€\\x9d and todayâ€™s autumn statement is her governmentâ€™s first big chance to show quite how serious it is about helping this group. How different will her governmentâ€™s approach by from Cameronâ€™s? The briefing weâ€™ve had so far suggests the answer is â€˜a bit, but not hugelyâ€™, but weâ€™ll know more by the end of the day. Iâ€™m Andrew Sparrow and I will be blogging today with my colleague Graeme Wearden. We will be covering the statement in full and then bringing you reaction and analysis, focusing in particular on whatâ€™s hidden in the small print of the governmentâ€™s announcements.',\n",
              "  'Boris Johnson urged to disinvest from bank linked to Saudi regime The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has been pressed not to put profit before principle after it was revealed that the Greater London Authority has Â£100m of public money invested in a bank backed by Saudi Arabia. The GLA treasury has a Â£2.5bn portfolio of investments in a range of foreign banks, including Â£100m in the Riyad Bank, which is 51% owned by the Saudi state. Opposition parties have called on the government to distance itself from the Saudi regime in response to the execution of 47 people on Saturday, including the Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. UK government ties to Saudi Arabia have frequently been criticised because of the countryâ€™s poor record on human rights, including extensive use of the death penalty. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, called on Johnson to pledge never to invest public money in such regimes, saying â€œwords are not enoughâ€\\x9d.. â€œInvesting Londonersâ€™ funds into Saudi government-backed banks seems to suggest Boris and his administration condone the horrific and systematic human rights abuses committed in the kingdom,â€\\x9d said Farron. â€œInvesting in such places goes against everything London stands for. Profit should never come before principle.â€\\x9d The investments are managed by the Group Investment Syndicate (GIS), which includes the GLA, London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, the mayorâ€™s office for policing and crime, London Pensions Fund Authority and London Legacy Development Corporation. The GISâ€™s overall investment strategy is personally approved by Johnson. The group has another Â£100m invested in the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, which is majority owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE government has also come under fire for human rights abuses. There is no suggestion that either bank is mismanaged. A spokesperson for the GLA said the authority â€œhas a duty to ensure its short-term cash balances are invested with an aim of minimising the risks of any loss to the taxpayer. Those investments are made by officials in the group treasury team, without political involvement and targeting high-quality and creditworthy institutions.â€\\x9d Speaking to the BBCâ€™s World at One programme, Farron said that the UK governmentâ€™s attitude towards the Saudi regime was â€œalmost sycophanticâ€\\x9d. It should be â€œpragmatic, but not subservientâ€\\x9d, he said. â€œI think whatâ€™s important â€¦ is that as a country, being much clearer in our condemnation of the executions the other day would not only be right on a human rights aspect but also would send the right signals to Iran and to others in the Shia Muslim world that â€“ as we try to make the Vienna process work â€“ this is not the kind of action that we will tolerate.â€\\x9d',\n",

              "  \"Barack Obama's workout playlist proves he's master of the eclectic mixtape The US Democratic party have championed Barack Obamaâ€™s hip and eclectic music taste since sharing the nomineeâ€™s iPod playlist during the 2008 campaign. Now, as the president winds down his final term, heâ€™s revealed his curatorial powers extend to a particularly 21st century obsession: the well-crafted workout playlist. For his guest editorship of Novemberâ€™s Wired magazine, Obamaâ€™s team released his exercise soundtrack on Tuesday: a mixture of funk, pop, rock and hip-hop, with a few curveballs (and cheeseballs) thrown in. The playlist shares a few commonalities with his 2016 summer soundtrack: thereâ€™s a celebration of black artists, a few crowdpleasers (last yearâ€™s Good Vibrations is this yearâ€™s Letâ€™s Get It Started), and even a couple of double-ups â€“ independent Australian artist Courtney Barnettâ€™s Elevator Operator features on both playlists, as does Nina Simoneâ€™s Sinnerman. Jay Z gets another look-in, this time with Drake in 2009â€™s Off That. Itâ€™s preceded by Get Me Bodied by BeyoncÃ© â€“ who featured twice on Michelle Obamaâ€™s workout playlist, released in 2012. Also featured is Emergency by Swedish electropop duo Icona Pop â€“ a more original choice than 2012â€™s I Love It, which remains unavoidable in gyms around the world; the Isley Brothersâ€™ funk-filled ode to free love, Live It Up; and, from slightly out of left field, thereâ€™s Perro Loco by Forro in the Dark â€“ a collective of Brazilian musicians who rework the rural forro music for the club scene of New York. Obama â€“ who hosted his first ever music festival, South by South Lawn (SXSL), earlier this month â€“ proved himself a master of the mixtape when he released the White Houseâ€™s summer playlists in August to broad acclaim. Speaking with Pitchfork at SXSL, the White Houseâ€™s first chief digital officer Jason Goldman said the choices are all the presidentâ€™s: â€œI swear it is him who makes the playlists. He has personally selected all of those songs and writes them out by hand. He really loves a diverse range of music.â€\\x9d In 2015, Obama became the first sitting president to visit Jamaica in more than 30 years. Dropping in at the Bob Marley Museum, he told press heâ€™d been â€œa big fanâ€\\x9d since high school. This might explain the gym playlist inclusion of Could You Be Loved which, much like Stingâ€™s If You Love Somebody Set Them Free, is perhaps more befitting of a dawdle than a gym drill. But perhaps itâ€™s one for the warm-down. The playlist does, however, not include Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper, who were recently invited to his Final State Dinner.

              "  'Brexit would be political arson, says David Miliband Leaving the EU would be an act of political arson that risks the destruction of international order, the former foreign secretary David Miliband has said. In one of the starkest warnings of the referendum debate so far, Miliband argued that the impact of Brexit could extend far beyond the UK and that it could have a disastrous effect on the rest of the world. Writing for the before delivering a key speech in Westminster on Tuesday, he said it would amount to â€œgiving up on our alliancesâ€\\x9d with the rest of the world. â€œIt means forsaking our position at the negotiating table and abandoning our international responsibilities â€“ unilateral political disarmament. No nation in human peacetime history has voluntarily given up as much political power as we are being invited to throw away on 23 June.â€\\x9d The former politician, who lost the Labour leadership race to his brother Ed in 2010, said leaving the EU could set off a domino effect across the world. â€œThe British question is not only one of what we get out of Europe. It is also one of whether we want to shore up the international order, or contribute to its dilution and perhaps even destruction,â€\\x9d said Miliband, who now heads the International Rescue Committee in New York. â€œBritain cannot solve these problems alone. But we do more in and for the world than our modest size would suggest. At our best, we lead in defending the values, building the structures and defining the substance of international cooperation. â€œIf the world is increasingly divided between firefighters and arsonists, then Britain has for centuries been a firefighter. This is no time for Britain to join the ranks of arsonists and there should be no doubt that Brexit would be an act of arson on the international order.â€\\x9d The EU referendum debate was further inflamed on Monday by a row over the governmentâ€™s decision to spend Â£9m on sending a leaflet making the case for the remain camp to every household in Britain. David Lidington, the Europe minister, defended the leaflet in the House of Commons by claiming the government would be â€œabrogating its responsibilityâ€\\x9d if it neglected to make its case to citizens. He was backed by Pat Glass, the shadow Europe minister, who said it was â€œperfectly reasonableâ€\\x9d for the government to make its case to people. However, Lidington was criticised by a raft of backbench Eurosceptics, including former cabinet ministers Liam Fox and John Redwood. Fox said it was a piece of â€œJuncker mailâ€\\x9d â€“ referring to the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker â€“ and branded it a â€œdodgy dossier: the sequelâ€\\x9d. Redwood said: â€œIsnâ€™t it an abuse of public money, an insult to electors, and do you realise itâ€™s going to drive many more people to vote to leave?â€\\x9d Several called for similar funds to be available to make the case for Brexit and pointed out ministers had promised the government would be â€œrestrained in their use of public moneyâ€\\x9d so that they did not compete with the campaigns on each side. Crispin Blunt, Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said the mail-shot was both a waste of public money and caused â€œdamage to the governmentâ€™s reputation for straight-dealing on this issueâ€\\x9d. Nigel Evans, a Tory backbencher, accused the government of â€œspiv Robert Mugabe anticsâ€\\x9d that he would condemn in his role as an international election observer. Lidington said Evans should reflect on the fact that Zimbabwe elections have involved the â€œmurder, maiming and intimidation of votersâ€\\x9d and realise it was not his finest moment in the Commons. Milbandâ€™s dire warning echoed those of David Cameron, Alan Johnson and other campaigners for the UK to stay in who have claimed Brexit would lead to years of uncertainty and danger. Brexit campaigners have accused their opponents of exaggerating the consequences of leaving the EU and claimed the remain activists are running a â€œProject Fearâ€\\x9d intent on scaring voters into staying in the EU. Last month Boris Johnson, the London mayor and Conservative MP, urged people thinking of voting to leave to hold their nerve and â€œnot be cowed by the gloomadon poppersâ€\\x9d who thought the UK would not prosper on its own. He went on to issue a plea for voters to â€œignore the pessimists and the merchants of doomâ€\\x9d who were arguing that the UK should fear being outside the EU â€“ an argument made by Cameron on the grounds of economic uncertainty and national security.',\n",
              "  \"AC/DC's Brian Johnson: hearing loss diagnosis was darkest day of my career AC/DCâ€™s Brian Johnson has revealed further details about why he had to stop playing live with the band. His statement comes in the same week that it was announced that Guns Nâ€™ Roses frontman Axl Rose will take over Johnsonâ€™s duties during AC/DCâ€™s forthcoming live shows. Johnson made it clear that he wasnâ€™t retiring from recording with the band, but that his health had made playing live shows impossible. In a statement he said: â€œOn March 7th, after a series of examinations by leading physicians in the field of hearing loss, I was advised that if I continued to perform at large venues I risked total deafness. While I was horrified at the reality of the news that day, I had for a time become aware that my partial hearing loss was beginning to interfere with my performance on stage â€¦ and because I was not able to hear the other musicians clearly, I feared the quality of my performance could be compromised. This was something I could not, in good conscience, allow. Our fans deserve my performance to be at the highest level, and if for any reason I canâ€™t deliver that level of performance I will not disappoint our fans or embarrass the other members of AC/DC.â€\\x9d Johnson was at pains to point out that he wasnâ€™t a â€œquitterâ€\\x9d and that there is nothing heâ€™d like more than to be able to continue playing live with the group. â€œI like to finish what I start. Nevertheless, the doctors made it clear that I had no choice but to stop performing on stage for the remaining shows and possibly beyond. That was the darkest day of my professional life.â€\\x9d He added that it was possible he could continue at some point in the future: â€œSince that day, I have had several consultations with my doctors and it appears that, for the near future, I will be unable to perform on stage at arena and stadium-size venues where the sound levels are beyond my current tolerance without the risk of substantial hearing loss and possibly total deafness. I tried as best as I could to continue despite the pain and hearing loss, but it became too much to bear and too much to risk.â€\\x9d Johnson said doctors had confirmed he could continue to record in the studio with the band: â€œAnd I intend to do that. For the moment, my entire focus is to continue medical treatment to improve my hearing. I am hoping that in time my hearing will improve and allow me to return to live concert performances. While the outcome is uncertain, my attitude is optimistic. Only time will tell.â€\\x9d Axl Rose, 54, will fulfil his current commitments to Guns Nâ€™ Roses before replacing Johnson on AC/DCâ€™s remaining tour dates. The last couple of years have been difficult for AC/DC. In July 2015, they parted company with drummer Phil Rudd after he was convicted of threatening to kill and possession of drugs. Rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young left in September 2014 after announcing he had dementia.\",\n",
              "  \"One family's nightmare as fraudsters ransack Barclays account by phone Fraudsters can contact Barclays bank, pose as a customer, ask for that personâ€™s account address to be changed, then take out huge loans against their name â€“ as one Nottingham teacher has found to her deep distress. Jude Grundy was just days away from moving home when the nightmare began, with her debit card being refused at a supermarket checkout. It later emerged that two weeks previously fraudsters had called Barclays, claimed to be her, and changed her address. They were then able to open a second linked account and apply for a new debit card. With that card the crooks were then able to obtain a Â£24,000 loan from Barclays and a Â£750 overdraft, as well as topping it off by stealing Â£4,000 in savings from Grundy and her husband, Andrew. She only found out about the linked account when, curiously, Â£2,000 was transferred into her account. It was this which the bankâ€™s systems blocked as suspicious. The fact that Grundy kept failing the security questions, on the account she had not herself opened, might have alerted Barclays staff to the fact that bigger problems were afoot. Only after Money intervened was her account unfrozen, which was when Grundy discovered that the Â£24,000 loan had been taken out and her savings were gone. â€œWhen I was finally able to log on I couldnâ€™t believe what I was seeing. I had been told the account was up and running again, but no one appears to have noticed it had been ransacked,â€\\x9d she says, describing her treatment by Barclays as shockingly bad. Not only did it hand control over her account to fraudsters, it then closed it, leaving all her usual direct debits unpaid. The timing could not have been worse. The mother of two should have spent the week packing, as the family completed on their first house purchase the following Friday. â€œThe staff who decided to freeze the account in the first place had not noticed any of this suspicious activity, it seems. They were happy to just pass it back to me,â€\\x9d Grundy says. She says staff at Barclays were sympathetic, but helpless to stop colleagues from closing the accounts without warning â€“ a week before they were due to move house. Only the next day did a letter arrive telling the couple that the bank had decided to shut their account, and that they must withdraw any funds held â€“ which was impossible because the account had already been closed. â€œBuying a house was stressful enough without having to go through this as well, and you donâ€™t know how many hours I have spent trying to get it all resolved,â€\\x9d she says. â€œI still donâ€™t know how the fraudsters were able to call up Barclays, change my address and get a loan. Iâ€™ve been told they had lots of information on me, but I have two passwords on the account which I donâ€™t think the fraudsters were asked for, and Iâ€™ve certainly never divulged them to anyone else. â€œThe whole thing has been unbelievable, shockingly bad, and I never want to hear their â€˜on-holdâ€™ music ever again.â€\\x9d A Barclays spokesman accepted that the episode had not been the bankâ€™s finest hour and it has now agreed to pay the couple Â£1,000 in compensation for the two failures. It has also paid for the couple to tax their car, which was one of the failed direct debits. All the other direct debits have now been reinstated, the loan has been cancelled, the savings restored, and the coupleâ€™s accounts are now running correctly again. â€¢ Barclays, which has been at the centre of several frauds reported by Money in recent years, has just started offering customers the option to use voice recognition software as a way to establish their identity when they call the bank. The technology recognises a customerâ€™s unique formation of words, cancelling the need for security questions or passwords. All Barclaysâ€™ personal telephone banking customers are eligible to use the system, though they can opt out. This could have saved the Grundys had it been introduced sooner. Several other banks are at various stages of introducing similar technology.\",\n",
              "  \"Junior doctors' strike day two - as it happened As the second day of the all-out strike draws to a close, NHS England says 78% of junior doctors (21,608) who were expected to be working did not report for duty today. The figures were the same yesterday. Last week trusts said they expected there would be 12, 711 postponed elective operations over the period of 18 April to 2 May. Dr Anne Rainsberry, national incident director for NHS England, said: â€œWeâ€™re not going to pretend the last two days have been easy but the NHS has remained open to business for patients. The health service has coped admirably to date thanks to extensive planning and the exhaustive efforts of other staff. However the strike has undoubtedly increased pressure on a service already facing increasing demand and has led to the highly regrettable cancellation of needed care for well over 100,000 patients.â€\\x9d Several junior doctors rejected suggestions that the government and the British Medical Association (BMA) are quite close on the new contract. One doctor said: â€œWe need to talk to them about exactly what their plan is for the seven-day NHS, how they are funding it, how they are going to staff it. Just changing Saturday pay is not going to solve the issue. Itâ€™s so complex, it canâ€™t be just about one thing.â€\\x9d Around 80% of all junior doctors (45,000 out of 54,000) across England) are members of the BMA. Helen Nightingale, 31, a junior doctor at St Maryâ€™s hospital, tells Alessio Perrone the imposition of a contract by the government is as crucial as to its contents. There hasnâ€™t had a BMA representative for a few months since the last one stepped aside yet the junior doctors have taken part in the strike. â€œRegardless of what Hunt said, they havenâ€™t been willing to sit down and discuss at any point. Not just with the BMA, with any junior doctor. The process has been misleading and we feel itâ€™s all been predetermined and imposed on us. Itâ€™s disrespectful to us as professionals. A lot of people are disillusioned regardless of the contract because itâ€™s been imposed, they are frustrated and powerless. Also, we are frustrated because the strikes havenâ€™t brought back the expected results, they havenâ€™t made any negotiations happen. Enthusiasm is picking up a bit in this strike, but we havenâ€™t seen the response we wanted.â€\\x9d Damien Gayle has moved on to Lewisham hospital where a packed picket line has massed around a table heaving with cake, which strikers were selling to raise money for a campaign to save the hospital. â€œThe NHS runs on cake and goodwill,â€\\x9d said Shruti Patel, a trainee paediatric doctor. â€œThis is a good way for the community, for NHS staff and junior doctors to do something positive with the strike, to raise money for a community campaign that has been instrumental in saving this hospital and getting our message out to the public.â€\\x9d Patel branded as â€œridiculousâ€\\x9d claims that the government and BMA positions were close: â€œIf the positions were close do you think we would go to all this dramatic effort? Do you think we would manage to get this many junior doctors out if really all that was left was Saturday pay? We feel that the contract is completely unsustainable. â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a question of the BMA leading anyone anywhere. The BMA is made up of junior doctors. This is absolutely a grass roots course of action. As to whether itâ€™s a dead end or not, that completely lies in the hands of the government. The power to end this dispute is in the governmentâ€™s hands.â€\\x9d Peter Latham, an NHS-trained doctor in Australia, says he is unsure of returning to the UK. â€œIâ€™m saddened and upset for my former colleagues who are having to go against their deepest morals and walk away from patient care to ensure the long-term safety of an open access and safe NHS.â€\\x9d When asked whether he would return to the NHS, he admitted that, at first, his intention was to leave to experience life in another country and then come back. Now, heâ€™s not so sure. â€œI have always pictured my career in the NHS,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI believe in what it traditionally stood for and I believe it is the best model of healthcare. Now I have no idea what Iâ€™m going back to. I fear doctors will flee from such a poorly led system and leave those in it stranded. Then it will be left open for private takeover. I donâ€™t want to work in a dangerously understaffed NHS or a privately-run one. That leaves my options limited. I canâ€™t see a resolution under Jeremy Hunt.â€\\x9d Junior doctors have been telling Damien Gayle that suggestions that the BMA and government are actually quite close are off the mark. Claims that the BMA and government positions were actually quite close were government spin, said Benjamin Robinson, a psychiatry registrar at Maudsley, just over the road from Kings College Hospital. â€œThe reason they are saying that is they want to say that this is based on reasons that are selfish,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWhat the government really doesnâ€™t understand is that the contracts are going to disrupt our relationships with patients, because the new contracts have rotas - times when we work - which mean that you wonâ€™t as a patient get to see the same doctor on anything like a regular basis. We wonâ€™t be able to form the relationships that especially in mental health you have got to have with a doctor. Cate Manning, also a psychiatry registrar, said this was already a problem that patients cared about, and the governmentâ€™s plans would only make it worse. â€œItâ€™s just not actually workable. There are not enough of us to staff a seven-day NHS as if it was five days,â€\\x9d she said. Robinson added up: â€œDo [you] understand the distinction between Jeremy Huntâ€™s spin on the seven-day NHS? The reality is that if Jeremy Hunt has a heart attack on Christmas day we will be there to help him. For him to claim heâ€™s creating a seven-day NHS is just ridiculous. If heâ€™s saying that people can get their toenails removed at 8pm on a Saturday night, the way to do that is not mess around with junior doctors contracts.â€\\x9d Many will be wondering at how the impasse over the new contract for junior doctors will be broken. Damien Gayle has been asking the â€œwhat nextâ€\\x9d question of strikers at Kingâ€™s College hospital in south London. Striking junior doctors were collecting ideas for a debate on how they can take their fight forward, with little sign that the government is prepared to back down. Maryann Noronha, who works in emergency medicine at Kings, said she and her colleagues had until now been focused on these two days of all out strike action. â€œThe government doesnâ€™t look like itâ€™s going to soften, so we really need to plan how we can rack up the pressure, but at the same time still not put patients at risk. Itâ€™s a tough line to follow,â€\\x9d she said. â€œI was just speaking to a lady here and she was saying â€˜you are not going to win, you should just give up, they are going to privatise the NHS.â€™ We were saying we (doctors) will be better off in a private system; we are here because we are fighting for the morality of it - we believe in the system.â€\\x9d Noronha denied suggestions that the governmentâ€™s and BMAâ€™s positions were actually by now quite close - a criticism levelled at the junior doctors by some. â€œThe media has made it very close in the sense that they are focusing in on the Saturday pay. Thatâ€™s pretty much what they are saying: that if the Saturday pay issue is resolved we would be fine. But I think if today the government said â€˜We are still going to impose but we will align with the Saturday pay issueâ€™, we wouldnâ€™t agree with that. â€œWe need to talk to them about exactly what their plan is for the seven-day NHS, how they are funding it, how they are going to staff it. Just changing Saturday pay is not going to solve the issue. Itâ€™s so complex, it canâ€™t be just about one thing.â€\\x9d Despite accusations from some commentators that the BMA had led junior doctors into a dead end, Noronha was staunchly behind her union. â€œThe BMA are trying their best to negotiate with this government. Itâ€™s a difficult job, itâ€™s not easy to sit between everything, to represent every single junior doctor in the country. I donâ€™t think they they have taken us down a dead end, I think they are trying their best to bring then government plans back down to reality and get some concrete answers.â€\\x9d A junior doctor currently on a break from medicine in the US has contacted the â€™s Sarah Johnson about the strike. Namrata Turaga who worked only three as a junior doctor is studying for an MBA degree at Harvard Business school and has been keeping track of events as they unfold. She has been following developments with increasing frustration. She said: â€œI needed a break from a system that I felt was not adequately providing the vital clinical training I need to be the best doctor I can be and from a world where I had no choice but to agree to a work schedule that included only 12 day shifts in six months â€“ the rest were evening or night shifts.â€\\x9d She has been watching colleagues and friends in the UK become â€œincreasingly frustrated with their concerns being ignored or belittledâ€\\x9d and was inspired to take classes on negotiations and complex deal making. She wrote a simulation based on the current junior doctorsâ€™ contract dispute, the result of which was students with a non-medical background reaching a deal by trading and compromising on issues. â€œIt has left me wondering, if the Department of Health in the UK is simply choosing not to compromise with the junior doctors,â€\\x9d she said. â€œI hope that the strike is called off early because the government sees sense and listens to all the Royal Medical Colleges and patient safety organisations that are asking them to get back to the negotiating table. I hope people choose to work with one another, for the sake of fairness and for patients.â€\\x9d Damien Gayle has more on the money striking doctors have collected for a food bank. Striking junior doctors at Kings College hospital have collected Â£300 and a pile on non-perishable food to donate to a local food bank. Lucy Carter, an acute medicine doctor, said: â€œIn the run up to the strike we had a food bank drive on the wards and among the junior doctors to bring in foods or cash donations, and yesterday during the industrial action we had another collection. We are taking it to Southwark food bank because we are all quite aware that this hospital serves some of the most underprivileged boroughs in London - Southwark and Lambeth - and itâ€™s time we did something positive with industrial action. Lots of people on the street have come by to bring us tea or coffee and we are not the people who need it the most.â€\\x9d Hannah Orrell, a trainee surgeon at Kings who had just come off a night shift, tells Damien Gayle that Jeremy Huntâ€™s new contract would spell the death knell for the health service. The implications of the contract for me are quite far reaching. Iâ€™m hoping that I will be in the NHS for 30 to 40 years and, from what we can see on the NHS frontline, services are already overstretched as it is. When the new contract is imposed it means that five days worth of services will be stretched to seven days, with the same number of staff. We think that not only will this be unfair for us but it will be unsafe for patients. Orrell said that when she arrived at work at 5pm last night, she found that her department had been well covered. â€œWe had a consultant for each surgical specialism ... I was in work from 5pm to 8am and heard from the consultants that everything ran smoothly. There were not any concerns over safety. All that was left for me to do was paperwork. I will be in again today from 5pm to 8am. Iâ€™m safe in the knowledge that the consultants know where we are, they know our numbers. If anything was to go wrong we are willing to go in. But we are confident that it will be safe and we encourage people to use services if they need to.â€\\x9d Will it take a change of health secretary to break the deadlock and finally settle the junior doctorsâ€™ dispute? Bill Morgan - who was a special adviser to Andrew Lansley, Jeremy Huntâ€™s predecessor - thinks it might. â€œThe situation is at a complete stalemate. Jeremy Hunt has the support of Number 10 and the juniors have the support of their consultants. The public have been pretty steadfast in their support of juniors, but thatâ€™s been the same since the start â€“ public opinion is neither rallying to their cause nor draining away. In short, neither the BMA nor the government is weak enough to lose. â€œUnless and until something happens to decisively shift the balance the strikes are going to continue. Itâ€™s impossible to predict how this might play out. On the one hand, juniors might lose the support of their consultants if a local hospital declares an emergency during strike action and the juniors donâ€™t come in off the picket line. â€œOn the other hand, NHS performance might deteriorate so far as a result of strike action that Number 10 pulls the plug. But at the moment neither is on the cards and both side are holding firm. The only other possible route to resolution is a change in the personalities. â€œThereâ€™s an element of the â€˜Jeremy and Johannâ€™ show about this, and if either or both move on their replacements might be more dovish and more willing to compromiseâ€\\x9d, says Morgan, who is now a partner in Incisive Health, a specialist health public affairs firm. Steven Morris has interviewed a couple of the older junior doctors - doctors below consultant level - on the picket line at the RUH in Bath. James Leggett, 38, re-trained after a career as an academic, dong research in neuroscience and is now an F1 doctor (between medical school and specialist training) currently doing general surgery at the RUH in Bath. â€œIâ€™ve always voted, Iâ€™ve always read party manifestos but Iâ€™ve never felt at the sharp end of a government campaign like this. I think the government has backed itself into a corner. Theyâ€™ve made promises they canâ€™t fulfil but rather than backing down are intent on pushing through. They need to have a bit less ego and a bit more honesty as well as more compassion for patients and doctors. I think theyâ€™d get a lot of credit if they backed down and apologised. I donâ€™t regret re-training. I love medicine. But itâ€™s hard to deal with the day-to-day pummelling were getting. Weâ€™re being berated and belittled.â€\\x9d Rebecca Fallaize, 36, has spent longer than most as a junior doctor because she has had two children over the last five years. She believes the â€œweird structureâ€\\x9d of the shift system the government wants to impose will harm patient safety. Fallaize is a specialist bowel cancer surgeon. â€œItâ€™s continuity of care that improves patient safety. The fragmented nature of the proposed contract means that the continuity will be lost. Itâ€™s important to see your patient regularly. If you donâ€™t see the patient every day, itâ€™s hard to get that continuity, to build that rapport and have that understanding of how the patient is doing.â€\\x9d The strikers at Kingâ€™s College have been raising money for a food bank in the London borough of Southwark. Alex Gates, 29, organiser of the picket line at the RUH in Bath, says the striking doctors are as motivated on day two as they were on day one. He thinks the next move should be for more pressure to be placed on hospital bosses to challenge the government. â€œIf 20 chief executives signed a letter calling for the government to think again, I think that would sort it,â€\\x9d he said. Lucy Rose Jefferson, 26, who works in the geriatrics department at the RUH in Bath, is in what she calls the â€œDoomsday camp.â€\\x9d â€œIf the government wins this, theyâ€™ll go after the nurses, the physiotherapists, everyone else. It will be the beginning of the end for the NHS.â€\\x9d Aisha Gani has been talking to Dolin Bhagawati, a registrar at the national hospital for neurology at Queen Square (central London) who has been a doctor for nine years. He says the specialist hospital he is at has probably 40 junior doctors and about 20 consultants, and at any one time 30 junior doctors. â€œThe majority were on strike yesterday - we had four junior doctors working and all consultants were working.â€\\x9d He said heâ€™s on strike as â€œthis contact is unsafe and discriminatory and if imposed will worsen staff conditions. Itâ€™s not trialled and not evidence based.â€\\x9d He added: â€œNine years as a junior doctor I have worked in three continents - US, India and here. I found here itâ€™s very rare to have worked in a full rota and doctors have gone above and beyond to cover and fill gaps. People have worked illegal shifts. I myself am considering my future here. My wife is Indian and her first thought when she saw my working pattern was that I am being paid less and working harder than I would in India. As a consultant neurosurgeon, the average pay here would be Â£70,000 in U.S it Would be $700,000 (Â£479,994). In Seattle, my boss was on $4m - so itâ€™s not about money. These are qualified intelligent people who have chosen a vocation. So rather than seeing the effect of this contract we want to negotiate and work with the government and get back to what we want to do and treat patients. Prevention is better than cure.â€\\x9d Itâ€™s not all support for junior doctors, reports Alessio Perrone at St Maryâ€™s in west London. Some passers-by shout their disapproval. â€œGet back to work now. People could die!â€\\x9d one person said. Then a runner: â€œShame on you!â€\\x9d And again: â€œShame on you!â€\\x9d Junior doctor Ali Yazdi, who works in the geriatrics department, shouted back that their bosses supported them and are covering for them. He says itâ€™s frustrating when this happens. â€œI understand some people donâ€™t agree with us, but I wish they stopped to talk to us,â€\\x9d he said. â€œInstead many just shout and run away. We canâ€™t explain our position.â€\\x9d The numbers of pickets at Royal University hospital in Bath are picking up considerably. Juniors on the picket line at Kingâ€™s College say official figures on the number of their colleagues who went to work yesterday are misleading, writes Damien Gayle. According to the hospital press office, six junior doctors turned up to work in emergency departments across the trust - which also includes Princess Royal University hospital. However, despite being asked to do so by the , the trust did not indicate how many of these were juniors on staff grade contracts. These doctors are not covered by the strike as they are not on training contracts. Chris James, a trainee anaesthetist, said he had spoken to consultants in A&E who told him no trainee doctors had gone to work. â€œYesterday at Kings A&E there were zero junior doctors. At the Pru (Princess Royal) there were five staff grade doctors. They are specialists who are not on these contracts, they are not involved in this dispute. So overall, across both sites, there were zero junior doctors,â€\\x9d he said. â€œToday we have got three non-training doctors - not on training contracts - at Kingâ€™s, and I think itâ€™s the same at the Pru again. Thatâ€™s come from the consultant body. They were happy that they staffed it safely [yesterday], they had full cover and they had no problems at all.â€\\x9d Maddy Wells has just finished night shift in intensive care last night at University College hospital and has joined the picket line. She tells Aisha Gani there are eight junior doctors per shift on an average day and two consultants. No junior doctors worked yesterday from 8-5pm and there were six consultants covering. â€œMy main reason for striking is despite multiple attempts at negotiation from people in prominent positions with Jeremy Hunt he has failed to listen,â€\\x9d said Wells. An assortment of signs from St Maryâ€™s in Paddington, were numbers are picking up, writes Alessio Perrone. About 20-25 doctors have joined the picket, but they expect it to get much busier after 9.30am, when most surgeries start. Aisha Gani is at University College hospital in central London, where about two dozen junior doctors are on the picket line on a chilly April morning. Lina Carmona was on call as urology registrar last night, while she is also doing her PhD in prostrate cancer at UCL. She trained as a doctor in Colombia and came to the UK to work as a registrar. She has been a doctor for eight years and has a small child. â€œWeâ€™re supposed to be encouraging people, and women to be doing research. My wages doing a PhD is much lower than being registrar. I used to earn Â£3,000 a month and now I earn Â£1,600 and paying for my PhD. So whoâ€™s going to want to go into research when your salary is frozen. â€œMy mentor is a consultant urologist and publishes research and has four children. She is my role model but I was talking to her and she said if I was in your position I wouldnâ€™t know what Iâ€™d do. â€œSo if I continue to do this job Iâ€™ll just be treated as a junior junior doctor again. I came here as I love research. I come from a country where we have to work dangerous hours and wouldnâ€™t have any rest.â€\\x9d Striking junior doctors are just setting up their pickets at the entrance to the Kingâ€™s College hospital compound in Camberwell, south London, writes Damien Gayle. Progress is slower than yesterday, some of those helping put of banners admitted to being hoarse from last nightâ€™s demo march through central London. Yesterday had seen hundreds of striking doctors join the picket at its height in the afternoon. As many are expected today, but the atmosphere is muted for now. Chris James, a trainee anaesthetist, said that yesterdayâ€™s strike had really impressed on them the power of the media, and how much most outlets were happy to back the governmentâ€™s line. James said: â€\\x9dYesterday was about where are we, whereâ€™s everyoneâ€™s support base, are we doing the right thing, are we not. This whole thing is very emotionally charged. Today is a lot more about taking stock.â€\\x9d Despite warnings from the government, James and his colleagues said they believed there had been adequate cover in critical departments of the hospital. â€œI had a chat with our clinical director here saying we are staffing one to one in A&E. Thatâ€™s where they were talking about the big risk, whereas yesterday was the safest day to go to A&E.â€\\x9d Kingâ€™s strikers had hired an open top bus yesterday, which they used to tour south west London neighbourhoods before travelling to St Thomas for last nightâ€™s march. People they met had been mostly supportive, he said. â€œWe had the odd person who would argue with us but if you actually engage with them and tell them [they say] they didnâ€™t realise about the inequality issues, about stretching a five-day service over seven.â€\\x9d Kingâ€™s - and the wider NHS - have problems, James admitted, but management and the government were attempting to solve them without consulting those at the sharp end. â€œThe people who are doing it day in day out, who have got the most experience, they are not engaging with them. It just feels like thatâ€™s systematic of the whole problem. If you had an open discussion about whatâ€™s happening in the NHS then you can change.â€\\x9d As well as reading your reaction to todayâ€™s strikes in the comments, weâ€™d like to hear from those of you who are involved and see your pictures of where you are. Are you a junior doctor on the picket lines today? Maybe you are there in solidarity, or perhaps you have gone to work as a covering senior medic? If you are not a medical worker but are at one of the hospitals up and down the country that is affected, weâ€™d also like to hear from you. You can share any photos you have by clicking on the blue Witness buttons on this article and weâ€™ll use some of them as part of our ongoing coverage. My colleague Steven Morris is at the Royal United hospital, a major acute-care hospital in the Weston suburb of Bath. It seems the Department of Health has been reaching out to lobby correspondents, including Sam Coates of the Times, to be its new director of communications. The Spectator has this nugget on its so far fruitless search. With the junior doctorsâ€™ strike now in full swing, itâ€™s fair to say that these arenâ€™t the most harmonious days staff at the Department of Health have ever seen. Perhaps thatâ€™s why they are looking for a new director of communications to take charge of the departmentâ€™s â€˜external and internal communication activities across a complex and high profile agendaâ€™. Alas, so far they donâ€™t appear to have had much luck enticing candidates to the public relations role. Despite enlisting the help of â€˜executive search firmâ€™ Veredus, the search is still on and recruiters appear to be spending their time sending unsolicited messages to members of the lobby. Sam Coates, the Timesâ€˜s deputy political editor, has shared a message online that he received asking if he would be interested in the role â€” which carries a starting salary of Â£120,000. Alas, Coates was left unimpressed after two of his friends were approached about the same role just last week. Junior doctors on the picket line at St Maryâ€™s hospital in Paddington, west London. The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was out yesterday showing his support for striking junior doctors. David Cameron took the opposite tack saying it was â€œnot rightâ€\\x9d for junior doctors to withdraw emergency care. Denis Campbell, the â€™s health policy editor, writes: Yesterday the highly-respected NHS blogger and health policy analyst, Roy Lilley, wrote, in effect, â€œa plague on both your housesâ€\\x9d about the BMA and Jeremy Hunt for their tactics during the dispute. Today Lilley renews his criticism of the doctorsâ€™ union - both its leadership and its junior doctors committee headed by Dr Johann Malawana. â€œIâ€™m thinking about the great NHS strike of 2016 when the junior doctors took on the mighty machinery of government and... and... and what? Lost, I suspect. What is there to win? The union have led their members into a cul-de-sac. More strikes, more disruption? More risk to reputation, careers, public patience? Letâ€™s be honest, the contract is not the draconian settlement it is billed as. The gap between the BMA and the DH is easily bridgeable. The BMA walked away from David Dalton and the DH threw their toys out of the pram. The JDs have let themselves become a lightning rod for every complaint and disaffection there is in the NHS work place. Their strategic communications woeful.â€\\x9d But Lilley is also worried about the lingering impact of the whole sorry saga on morale at the NHS frontline. NHS hospital trusts will have to make big efforts to try and engage with their junior doctors to keep them motivated -- not an easy task, he believes. â€œThere are plenty of studies about behaviour in post-strike work places. Smouldering resentment. Strikes are industrial warfare. Employees lose money, somebody will have lost face. Emotions run hot.â€\\x9d Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, last night called on Jeremy Hunt to name an â€œhonest brokerâ€\\x9d to help bring people back to the table and has put forward its health spokesman, Norman Lamb. Negotiations are at a standstill, with no end in sight. Something must be done before there is serious risk to the public... Our health spokesperson and former care minister, Norman Lamb would be an ideal honest broker, with experience in the department, credibility among health professionals and a record of delivering improvements in services. If the government and the BMA are willing to bring a third, independent, party to the table, Norman is prepared to work with both sides to find a way out of this dispute. Itâ€™s day two of the first all-out strike in NHS history. Junior doctors â€“ all those below the level of consultant - will again stay away from hospitals from 8am and 5pm. On the first day, four out of five junior doctors walked out as David Cameron criticised their withdrawal of emergency care. At some hospitals, almost 90% of junior doctors refused to work in an escalation of their campaign against the new contract that the health secretary Jeremy Hunt intends to impose on them. However, most hospitals coped well and did not experience any problems. Senior medics took on duties usually undertaken by their junior colleagues. A&E units were quieter than usual as patients with minor ailments heeded NHS warnings to stay away. Figures released by NHS England showed that 21,608 junior doctors â€“ 78% of those due to work â€“ participated in the industrial action. It claimed that this was down from the 88% who did so on each day during the previous strike on 6-8 April. However, the 88% figure raised questions as NHS England had previously said that almost half of doctors had worked on those days. Turnout was highest at Barts Health, the largest trust in the NHS. The London trust said that 88.4% of its 1,000 junior doctors had joined the walkout. Unlike four previous strikes, this stoppage is the first one to affect areas of life-or-death treatment, such as A&E, maternity and intensive care. More than 125,000 appointments and operations have been cancelled and will need to be rearranged as a result of the latest strike.\",\n",
              "  'US border control could start asking for your social media accounts The US government is proposing making social media accounts part of the visa screening process for entry into the country. US Customs and Border Protectionâ€™s proposed change would add a line on both the online and paper forms of the visa application form that visitors to the US must fill out if they do not have a visa and are planning on staying for up to 90 days. The following question would be added to both the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) and I-94W forms: â€œPlease enter information associated with your online presenceâ€”Provider/Platformâ€”Social media identifier.â€\\x9d The information will be optional, for now, but the proposed change published by the US Federal Register states that â€œcollecting social media data will enhance the existing investigative process and provide Department of Homeland Security (DHS) greater clarity and visibility to possible nefarious activity and connections by providing an additional tool set which analysts and investigators may use to better analyze and investigate the case.â€\\x9d The proposal is currently under consultation, with US government taking comments until 22 August. The change forms part of the plan by the US DHS to scrutinise social media activity of visa applicants and those wishing to enter the country, following the San Bernardino killings in California, in which social media profiles formed part of the investigations along with an iPhone 5C. Current DHS pilot programmes are being kept under wraps but are said to scan a limited amount of social media posts. The pilot programmes currently used by DHS do not sweep up all social media posts, though government officials have kept details of the programmes closely held, as they do not want to reveal the precise process they use to try and identify potential threats. Itâ€™s unclear if or how the DHS would verify information written on a form before hitting border control, leaving the possibility of false information being put down, and while the information may be optional, it will likely be difficult to discern what is and isnâ€™t required on the form. The US government approves around 10m visa applications a year and had 77.5 million foreign visitors in 2015. Collecting social media accounts for all visitors could produce one of the largest government-controlled databases of its kind almost overnight.

              "  'Churchill would have been a committed voter to remain in EU Winston Churchill still stands at the centre of the modern Conservative partyâ€™s view of Britain and of itself. So it was inevitable that sooner or later the two Tory sides in the argument about Britainâ€™s place in Europe would begin to battle it out for the ownership of Churchillâ€™s view of Europe and as arbiters of which way he might vote in the forthcoming referendum. On Monday, the two sides went head-to-head as David Cameron laid explicit claim to the wartime prime ministerâ€™s support for the remain camp in the cause of European peace stability. Boris Johnson insisted that Churchill wanted no part in the European Union. Cameronâ€™s speech stressed that Churchill was never by choice an isolationist from Europe in either war or peace. â€œChurchill never wanted that,â€\\x9d he said at the British Museum. After the war Churchill had argued passionately for western Europe to come together. A few hours later, Johnson â€“ who is also, in his own solipsistic fashion, a biographer of Churchill â€“ accused the EU of becoming ever more anti-democratic and a force for instability not security. Johnson didnâ€™t actually mention Churchill in his speech. But he did in questions afterwards, when he said that although the European project had kept the postwar peace, Churchill had wanted Britain to play no part in it. So which of them is right? Which way might Churchill have voted if he was still alive and was, at the age of 141, still on the electoral register? This is, of course, an unhistorical question. Churchill died in January 1965 so he canâ€™t know what the issue feels like in May and June 2016, more than half a century later. But there are plenty of clues in his long career that suggest where his heart might lie. One of those is Churchillâ€™s enthusiastic attempt, at the height of the battle for France in 1940, to create political union between Britain and France in a plan which would have made every British citizen a citizen of France and vice versa, with a single government and single armed forces. By any standards, this was a radical sharing of sovereignty that would be difficult for a Brexiteer to swallow at any time. Cameron is also right that the postwar Churchill was not an isolationist either. He might have, but didnâ€™t, quote from a speech to the 1948 European congress at The Hague in which, then the leader of the opposition, Churchill said this about economic and political cooperation in Europe: It is said with truth that this involves some sacrifice or merger of national sovereignty and characteristics, but it is also possible to regard it as the gradual assumption by all nations concerned of that larger sovereignty which can also protect their diverse and distinctive customs, and their national traditions.â€\\x9d Thereâ€™s not much there for Nigel Farage there, either. But Johnson is right in one respect. Although Churchill made a speech in Zurich in 1946 in which he called for the creation of a United States of Europe, he did not seem to envisage Britain being part of it. Churchill was a British imperialist. He always saw Britain at the centre of the imperial network, later the Commonwealth. And he was an Atlanticist, not least by birth (his mother, Lady Randolph Churchill, was born in Brooklyn), with a profound loyalty to the notion of the Anglosphere, which continues to attract many on the isolationist right today. Nevertheless, Churchill did not share todayâ€™s Brexiteer obsession with pushing these issues to defining choices. He said in a Tory conference speech in 1948 that Britain was part of three â€œmajestic circlesâ€\\x9d â€“ the empire and Commonwealth, the English-speaking world and a â€œunited Europeâ€\\x9d. He called these circles â€œco-existentâ€\\x9d and â€œlinked togetherâ€\\x9d. A year later, speaking to the European Movement, he said also it was essential to persuade the Commonwealth that its â€œinterests as well as ours lie in a United Europeâ€\\x9d. Tellingly, whenever Churchill talked about Europe he almost always talked about â€œweâ€\\x9d not â€œtheyâ€\\x9d. And he wasnâ€™t just a romantic visionary, he was also a pragmatist. According to his solicitor general Sir John Foster, Churchill became a convert to the European convention on human rights when a woman in the Channel Islands was arrested on a charge of bestiality, for which local medieval law prescribed the mandatory punishment of being burned at the stake. Churchill sent the Royal Navy to spring the woman from custody and drop her on the French coast. As a result of that case, it was said by one of his ministers, Churchill was a firm supporter of Europeâ€™s overriding written code of rights and principles, which his ministers helped to draw up. Which way would Churchill vote on 23 June? We cannot know. But everything we know about Churchillâ€™s sense of vision and his pragmatic approach to issues of the day suggests to me that he would be a committed voter to remain.',\n",
              "  '500,000 Britons a year will be diagnosed with cancer by 2035, study shows More than half a million Britons a year will be diagnosed with cancer by 2035, making it hard for NHS services to cope with the extra demand for testing and treatment, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) has warned. The number of people across the UK found to have cancer every year is expected to rise from 352,000 to an estimated 514,000 in less than 20 years â€“ more than 160,000 extra cases annually â€“ according to research in the British Journal of Cancer. The vast majority of the expected 162,000 additional cases â€“ 141,000 â€“ will be caused by the ageing and growing population. However, another 12,600 will be the result of a combination of lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol or poor diet, and also improved screening for the disease. In 1993, 127,000 men and 128,000 women were diagnosed with the disease. By 2014, the numbers had risen to 173,000 and 179,000 respectively. This future trends analysis, based on examining cancer data going back to 1979, predicts that 244,000 women and more than 270,000 men will be diagnosed in 2035. Those big rises mean there is an â€œurgent need to plan for the future of NHS cancer services, which are already stretched to the limit as they struggle to cope with a growing and ageing populationâ€\\x9d, CRUK said. â€œThe number of people getting cancer in the UK will incerease sharply in the next two decades. This is mostly the result of an ageing and growing population but, for women, lifestyle factors are playing an increasingly important roleâ€\\x9d, said Dr Rebecca Smittenaar, the studyâ€™s lead author and CRUKâ€™s statistics manager. Peopleâ€™s risk of developing cancer will also rise in actual terms, separate to the growing numbers diagnosed, due to increased life expectancy and population expansion. Cancer incidence rates have risen for both sexes in an almost unbroken way since records began in 1979, though they have recently begun edging downwards for men. Men have always been more likely than women to be diagnosed. In 1993, 783 f every 100,000 men aged 15 or over were diagnosed with cancer. That rose to 808 per 100,000 in 2014 and is predicted to increase again, albeit slightly, to 812 per 100,000 in 2035. The number of women in that age group who developed cancer rose from 564 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 664 per 100,000 in 2014. It is due to hit 685 by 2035, according to the study. CRUK last year revised its prediction for the number of people who would develop cancer at some point in their lives from one in three to one in two. Sir Harpal Kumar, the charityâ€™s chief executive, said the expected increases in cancer cases were â€œshockingâ€\\x9d. However, four in 10 cancers could be prevented if people drank less, did not smoke, ate a healthy diet and took more exercise, he said.',\n",
              "  'HSBC starts laying off 840 IT staff in UK HSBC has prompted union anger after it began laying off 840 IT workers as part of a Â£5bn cost-cutting move that will shift UK computer services operations to Poland, China and India. The outsourcing deal, which will shed 595 jobs in Sheffield and a further 245 posts lost in London, Leeds and Birmingham, is the first big tranche of redundancies under a restructuring plan that will eliminate 8,000 British jobs by the end of next year. HSBC said the relocation of IT jobs was part of its â€œlarge and ongoing IT investment to build a global world-class IT infrastructureâ€\\x9d that would still leave the UK playing a central role in HSBCâ€™s global IT and â€œemploying several thousand highly skilled professionalsâ€\\x9d. Last year HSBC said the reshaping of the bank, which is Europeâ€™s largest, was necessary to improve profitability and increase the annual dividend. However, unions said it was devastating for experienced IT staff to be told they must train overseas recruits before their jobs were transferred abroad and workers were made redundant. Most of the staff affected were being informed about the cuts on Monday with all the UK jobs to disappear by the end of this year. Dominic Hook, Uniteâ€™s national officer for finance, accused HSBC of fostering a â€œcynical race to the bottomâ€\\x9d after its decision to offshore IT jobs. He said: â€œHSBCâ€™s decision to axe so many IT jobs is as ruthless as it is reckless. For almost a year staff have been left in the dark about their futures, only to be told that before being shown the door theyâ€™re expected to train someone in India or China who will do their job for less money. Itâ€™s a deeply cynical move by a bank which wants to be an â€˜employer of choiceâ€™. â€œOffshoring IT jobs to so-called â€˜low-cost economiesâ€™ is extremely short-sighted. As IT glitches across the banks continue to prove, it is ultimately the customers who will suffer the consequences.â€\\x9d HSBC has had a torrid time since the 2008 banking crash, with a series of scandals leading to millions of pounds in fines and prompted it to consider shifting its HQ from London for Hong Kong. Profits have recovered, though regulatory demands for the bank to maintain higher reserves combined with volatile markets have restricted its ability to maintain a solid recovery. Profits at HSBC fell in the first three months of 2016, raising questions among investors about its promise to raise the value of the dividend. Pretax profits fell in the first three months of the year by 14% to $6.1bn (Â£4.2bn), which the bank described as â€œa resilient performance despite challenging market conditionsâ€\\x9d. If currency movements and other one-off items were excluded, profits tumbled by 18% to $5.4bn. The bank announced its three-year restructuring plan last year, designed to pare back its sprawling global network by shutting underperforming businesses to improve earnings hurt by high compliance costs, fines and low interest rates. The restructuring will eventually eliminate one job in five around the world and around one-sixth of jobs in Britain. As part of the cost cutting, a hiring and pay freeze across the bankâ€™s global operations was also imposed until the end of the year, although it has continued to pay hundreds of staff more than Â£1m a year. When the restructuring plan was announced, the chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said most of the job losses in Britain would come from staff leaving on their own accord. HSBC has 47,000 workers in the UK at the end of December 2015, according to its most recent annual report. John Hackett, chief operating officer of HSBC UK, sought to reassure staff that the bank was â€œcommitted to supporting employees through this processâ€\\x9d. However, he said it was clear for the last year the bank was aiming to achieve significant cost reductions by the end of 2017. â€œAs part of a global relocation exercise, around 840 non-customer-facing IT roles will transfer from the UK to other sites around the world by the end of March 2017. The UK will continue to play an important role in HSBCâ€™s global IT infrastructure, employing several thousand IT professionals,â€\\x9d he said.',\n",
              "  'The shelter that gives wine to alcoholics On a grey January morning at 9.15, residents of the Oaks shelter for the homeless started lining up, coffee mugs in hand, at a yellow linoleum counter. At half past the hour, the pour began. The Oaksâ€™ residents are hard-core alcoholics. They line up to get what most people would consider the very last thing they need: an hourly mug of alcohol. Dorothy Young, the Oaksâ€™ activities coordinator â€“ a stocky, always-smiling middle-aged woman who is part cheerleader, part event planner, part warden, part bartender â€“ stood behind the counter at a tap that dispenses cold white wine. She poured a measured amount of wine into each cup: maximum seven ounces at 7.30am for the first pour of the day, and five ounces each hour after that. Last call is 9.30pm. The pour is calculated for each resident to be just enough to stave off the shakes and sweats of detox, which for alcohol is particularly unpleasant â€“ seizures from alcohol deprivation can be fatal. The pour is strictly regulated: Young cuts off anyone who comes in intoxicated. They wonâ€™t be given another drink until they sober up. The Oaks is a converted hotel next to a pawnshop, in Carlington, a working-class neighbourhood on the west side of Ottawa, Canada. When residents first arrive, they tend to drink the maximum, every hour, every day. Many also drink whatever they can buy or shoplift outside the building. For most, this gradually changes. They stop drinking outside, begin to ask for fewer ounces, skip pours or have a â€œspecial pourâ€\\x9d of watered-down wine. Two residents get several hoursâ€™ worth at a time to take up to their rooms and ration out themselves. One man gave up alcohol but gets an hourly pour of grape juice, to stay part of the group. Ten of the Oaksâ€™ residents are mental health patients and donâ€™t get the pour â€“ just fewer than 50 others do. A few are women or younger men, but the majority are men in their 50s; it often takes several decades of drinking before people seek a different life and land here. Standard clothing in January was flannel pyjama bottoms and slippers with a down jacket. Many have long beards, dishevelled hair, and no front teeth â€“ alcohol will do that. Most are sick. Years or decades of drinking have left them with liver, heart and brain damage that will never be reversed. A nurse is on site 40 hours a week. At least once a week and whenever necessary, a doctor and specialist nurses come to see patients. Young leads physical stretching groups, a book club, shopping trips and outings; Little Rayâ€™s Reptile Zoo was a recent hit. The pour is what makes the Oaks different from every other well-run facility of its kind. It solves the residentsâ€™ most urgent problem: where can I get a drink? Virtually all the clients have tried to quit, over and over, and failed. They have spent decades drinking themselves into a stupor each day. One man was taken to A&E 109 times in six months. Another was picked up by the police or paramedics 314 times in one year. They have caused enough chaos and disorder that they have been kicked out of, or barred from Ottawaâ€™s other shelters. Before being accepted at the Oaks, if they could not beg or collect enough empty bottles to recycle to buy booze, many shoplifted rubbing alcohol or Listerine. Some shelters started filling their hand-sanitiser dispensers with soap, because residents drank the rub for the alcohol it contains. â€œWe have guys with wounds with worms in them,â€\\x9d said Kim van Herk, a psychiatric nurse with Ottawa Inner City Health, an organisation formed 15 years ago to address the needs of the cityâ€™s hardest-to-reach homeless people, many of whom are alcoholics. â€œAnd thatâ€™s our priority, but itâ€™s not their priority,â€\\x9d added Amanda MacNaughtan, a nurse coordinator. â€œThey are so dependent on alcohol that itâ€™s their most basic need,â€\\x9d said Van Herk. â€œIf that need is not being met, nothing else matters for them. Itâ€™s hard for other people to get their minds around how severe their addiction is â€“ they feel like theyâ€™re going to die. But once that need is met for them, they can start looking at other parts of their life.â€\\x9d The pour creates trust: here is a system that understands residentsâ€™ needs. This system loosens them from their drinking friends. It keeps them away from Listerine. Without the pour, they would stay outdoors, begging or stealing, in danger of losing their feet to frostbite. Indoors, they take their medicine, see their doctors and mental health workers, eat actual food, re-establish contact with their families. Giving free booze to homeless alcoholics sounds crazy. But it may be the key to helping them live a stable life. * * * Irwin Windsor, 39, has a broad, smiling face and short brown bristle-cut hair. Ten years ago he still had a normal life: a family and steady work with a moving company. Although there had been drinking in his own family, he remembers his childhood in British Columbia fondly. He lived for a few years with his beloved maternal grandmother, who was an occasional drinker. He has happy memories of just sitting with her and watching soap operas or The Price is Right, her favourite gameshow. She taught him to knit, crochet and cook. His stepfather, whom he adored, would get drunk two or three times a week when Irwin was little. But he was not abusive. When Windsor was in his 20s and had a job, he would take $100 Canadian (Â£55) from his paycheque and the two would drink. â€œWe would send my mother off to bingo and weâ€™d play cards and listen to music. We had a great time.â€\\x9d Windsor kept his drinking under control until 10 years ago. Then his stepfather died and his grandmother committed suicide. His weekly binges became daily binges, and then allâ€‘day binges. He lost his job, lost his apartment, and lost contact with his sons, who live in Vancouver. â€œI havenâ€™t seen them for almost 11 years,â€\\x9d he told me. â€œI donâ€™t want my sons to see me as an alcoholic.â€\\x9d He had nowhere to live. He had always been an early riser, and would wake at 4 or 5am, with the shakes, dry heaves and sweats. His first thought of the day â€“ virtually his only thought of the day â€“ was to calm the symptoms with a drink. He would go out to beg and, when he got enough money, then head to the LCBO, Ontarioâ€™s official chain of liquor stores. His drink was pale dry sherry, a fortified wine that contains 20% alcohol â€“ $7.99 for a 750ml bottle. On his worst days, Windsor was drinking eight to 10 bottles a day. He drank until he lost consciousness. The next day he would do it again. Three or four times a week, someone would come upon him passed out in the cashpoint lobby of a bank or in a downtown park, and call Ottawaâ€™s emergency number. The police and paramedics would get him up and take him to A&E or the police drunk tank. Windsorâ€™s lifestyle was not only self-destructive and devastating to his family, it was also costly to Canadaâ€™s taxpayers. A trip to the hospital cost $243 for the ambulance, and $250 for a doctorâ€™s assessment. Going to the police station cost $256 for just one officer to talk to him and make notes. These figures do not include hospital admission or any medical treatment, nor the hours paramedics had to spend waiting in A&E until Windsor was seen. Nor do they include the cost of arrest or a night in a police cell, or the fact that officers work in pairs, so theirs is never the work of just one person. Nor the costs incurred by putting all these public servants to work chauffeuring alcoholics instead of doing their jobs. For Windsor to visit A&E or the police lock-up three times a week, the good citizens of Ottawa were paying at the very least $1,000 (Â£550) a week and perhaps double or triple that. And all for services that did nothing to help him solve his problems. * * * In the late 1990s, a tiny group of people was responsible for absorbing a huge proportion of Ottawaâ€™s healthcare budget. Greater Ottawa had a population of about 750,000. About 1,000 of its residents were chronically homeless. Roughly half of those were alcoholics. Many were also drug users, and the majority had mental health problems. Health professionals struggled to handle them. Three of the four city shelters would not let drunk people in, and none permitted residents to drink while they were there. Some alcoholics would not go to a shelter if it meant suffering the shakes and sweats of detox, and those who did go in for the night made sure they got good and drunk before walking through the door, in order to stave off detox for as many hours as possible. One of the people grappling with this issue was Jeff Turnbull. One of the countryâ€™s most eminent physicians, he was at the time, president of the Medical Council of Canada. Very few doctors with Turnbullâ€™s credentials see homeless patients, but he did. He would see the same people in the Ottawa hospital A&E day after day. â€œIâ€™d give them antibiotics, and theyâ€™d show up the next day. Iâ€™d say, â€˜Did you take your antibiotics?â€™ and theyâ€™d say: â€˜What antibiotics?â€™â€\\x9d He started to ask his patients about the cause of all this chaos. â€œCome and see how I live,â€\\x9d said one. The man was startled when Turnbull showed up at the corner where he begged from passing motorists, then followed him into the shelter where he went for the night. Turnbull started to visit shelters regularly to treat their clients. In 1998, one man was causing increasing concern to those who cared for Ottawaâ€™s homeless population. Eugene Aucoin would drink mouthwash and fall asleep in snowbanks. â€œHe lost toes to frostbite, and he was a diabetic so his feet just would not heal,â€\\x9d said Wendy Muckle, then the director of Sandy Hill Community Health Centre. Turnbull would get to the shelter before 6am to try to give Aucoin his antibiotic injection before he set out in search of alcohol. Once Turnbull chased Aucoin down the street, syringe in hand. Aucoin, with only stubs for feet, managed to get away. Sheila Burnett, the executive director of Shepherds of Good Hope, the Catholic social services organisation that ran Aucoinâ€™s shelter, had an idea: she brought in a bottle of wine from home and gave Aucoin a drink when he woke up, to keep him there long enough to get his medicine. It worked. In the summer of 1998, Muckle, Turnbull, Burnett and others â€“ including Ottawaâ€™s police, the health department, leaders of the Business Improvement Areas â€“ began meeting regularly to figure out how to help this small group of people who were constantly showing up in the cityâ€™s shelters, hospitals and jails. They sat down with their most difficult patients and asked: what would have to happen for you to get medical care? From these conversations, they established Ottawa Inner City Health, an association of agencies and organisations with the goal of bringing real help to homeless people. For many patients, the pursuit of alcohol consumed all their energy. But what if they could hand it out, like medicine, as Burnett had? â€œWe looked around to see if anyone else was doing this,â€\\x9d said Muckle, who became executive director of Inner City Health. Just a few months earlier, Seaton House shelter in Toronto had opened what was probably the worldâ€™s first scheme giving regular doses of alcohol to homeless alcoholics. The programme began after three intoxicated men had frozen to death in the winter of 1995. Muckle and her colleagues spent a lot of time on the phone with Seaton House staff. The men served by the Seaton House programme were staying indoors, and seemed to be stabilising their lives. There had also been no political backlash in Toronto. But Ottawa was a much more conservative city, as Turnbull and Muckle found when they took their idea to city officials. â€œThe mayor looked at me like I had two heads,â€\\x9d said Turnbull. The Managed Alcohol Programme was launched in 2001 without any noticeable political opposition, largely because nobody knew about it who didnâ€™t have to know. It took some of the most complex patients out of other shelters, who were happy to see them go. The MAP, as it would become known, was opened by Inner City and Shepherds of Good Hope inside Shepherdsâ€™ large brick building downtown. â€œIt took the strain off A&E, incarceration, and shelters that canâ€™t deal with complex issues,â€\\x9d said Stephen Bartolo, Shepherdsâ€™ operations director.. For Turnbull and Muckle, giving the residents alcohol was a means to an end â€“ its purpose was to attract clients to a programme that also provided safe shelter, food, medical and mental health care. That meant the managed alcohol programme had to be part of an existing shelter system. That was not going to be the Salvation Army, which was founded in part to promote temperance. At first, they struggled to fill the MAPâ€™s 10 beds. â€œWe had to do a lot of convincing for people to try it,â€\\x9d said Muckle. â€œOnce they were in and saw how much better life was, they were converted. But it was not easy. We used to say that anyone who wanted to be in the programme did not need it and anyone who really needed the programme was hard to get in.â€\\x9d Funding was a huge problem. â€œWe wanted to avoid any situation where we could be criticised for using taxpayersâ€™ money to buy alcohol for alcoholics,â€\\x9d said Muckle. Inner City decided that most of the money for alcohol would have to come from their clientsâ€™ own benefit payments. â€œFor a period of time we had no funding and were often not able to meet payroll. When an invoice came in I would look at it and decide which one of my friends should pay it, and Iâ€™d call them up. Board members brought in office supplies.â€\\x9d Buying booze, even the cheapest rotgut, was also expensive. â€œWhen we first started our programme, with 10 residents, we were picking up cases of sherry every other day,â€\\x9d said Bartolo. There were also legal hurdles. â€œTo the Liquor Licensing Board, we looked like a drinking establishment â€“ but we could never get a liquor licence,â€\\x9d said Turnbull. For example, the cost of putting in a sprinkler system would have been prohibitive. A police sergeant, who was part of the group forming Inner City Health, came up with the solution. The law gave Ontario residents the right to make wine or beer in their own homes and gather to appreciate it â€“ no licence necessary. The MAP was the residentsâ€™ home. They could make wine â€“ with a little help from the staff. (More than a little, actually.) And gathering to appreciate it would not be a problem. * * * Today the wine for both the MAP and the Oaks â€“ which opened a decade later to provide long-term housing for MAP graduates â€“ is made at the Oaks. The winemaking room off the lobby is lined with 25 grey plastic barrels (and kept well-locked). The Oaks staff buy bags of ready-made white wine concentrate â€“ the red turned out to be stronger and got people drunk â€“ then add water and yeast. The residents help by cleaning the barrels and doing other jobs, always closely supervised. Overhead pipes take the wine to the pour counter tap, and staff members drive containers of wine across town to the MAP. The wine is just about drinkable â€“ probably more so if youâ€™re used to hand sanitiser. â€œA lot of our clients prefer quantity over quality,â€\\x9d said Bartolo. One hallmark of all the programmes of Inner City Health and its partners, from the beginning, was the second chance. â€œIn a lot of programmes, if you slip up, youâ€™re out,â€\\x9d said Ray MacQuatt, the earnest, endlessly patient Shepherds employee who runs the Oaks. â€œWeâ€™re about another chance tomorrow. If you have more good days than bad, weâ€™re going to get you moving in the right direction.â€\\x9d Initially, Muckle said, staff at the MAP took leniency too far. â€œThey got their pour to start the day,â€\\x9d she said, and then they went out to beg, coming back in time to sleep. â€œHalf the time in the afternoon there were no clients. We continued to serve them when we shouldnâ€™t have.â€\\x9d There were daily dramas, scuffles and shouting. There was just one small room and two staff to cope with 10 drunk clients. Arguments inevitably broke out. In the end, it was the clients themselves who wanted drunk people banned. The chaos was making them anxious â€“ and that made them want to drink. They needed to feel safe in their home. â€œThey told me, â€˜You have to stop letting drunk people into our programme,â€™â€\\x9d she recalled. â€œI was astonished. I told them, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s you.â€™ â€œThey said, â€˜Donâ€™t let us in when weâ€™re drunk.â€™â€\\x9d New rules were brought in: clients needed to clock in 30 minutes before, in order to get the pour. Anyone intoxicated didnâ€™t get a drink. Clients who were violent were asked to leave. â€œEither way, that does not mean they will not be welcomed back,â€\\x9d said Muckle. â€œSome of the people who need the help the most have taken many tries before they settle in â€“ that is the nature of addiction.â€\\x9d * * * There is a name for the strategy that Inner City Health uses: harm reduction. It is a familiar concept for heroin addicts, first implemented in Liverpool in the 1980s. The approach gained currency amid an HIV epidemic involving injecting drug users who often shared needles. Under this system, health workers give injecting drug users clean needles, and a daily dose of the opioids methadone or buprenorphine, which quiets cravings and allows addicts to live a more normal life. In some countries, people who fail on those treatments can even be prescribed a regular, medically supervised dose of heroin, which is very successful at returning users to stability. Needle programmes also bring drug users into treatment that they would not otherwise know about or trust. Thus, harm reduction is often the first step to abstinence. But it also recognises that not everyone can quit. Those who cannot are helped to live as healthy and as stable a life as possible. While harm reduction is now the global standard for working with injecting drug users, with alcoholics, it is not even part of the debate. Some â€œwetâ€\\x9d shelters â€“ hostels that allow residents to drink â€“ exist around the world, including at least three in London and two in Manchester. But regular provision of alcohol â€“ the pour â€“ exists in only a handful of Canadian cities; Ottawaâ€™s is the second-oldest and the most-studied programme. Officials from other countries have visited, and Sydney, Australia, has done a feasibility study. But the programme is a tough sell. Someone always says: â€œMy dad was an alcoholic and he quit. Why donâ€™t these people quit?â€\\x9d said Bartolo. When news of the programme finally appeared in the media, Turnbull received hate mail, much of it from the US. â€œA fair amount of people said we are killing alcoholics, and abstinence is the only way,â€\\x9d said Turnbull. He shook his head. â€œWe donâ€™t walk away from cancer we canâ€™t cure; we take a palliative approach. It hurts me to see guys drinking, but the alternative is not giving them any care.â€\\x9d For Ottawaâ€™s most serious alcoholics, the door to the managed alcohol system is in the cityâ€™s downtown area, on the ground floor of the Shepherdsâ€™ building, which used to be known as Hope Recovery. (â€œItâ€™s hellâ€™s asshole,â€\\x9d said Muckle. â€œNobody ever recovered there.â€\\x9d) Inner City Healthâ€™s programme there is now known as TED, which stands for Targeted Engagement and Diversion. TED offers no alcohol, but anyone, no matter how drunk, can come and sleep there. Residents are also allowed to store a bottle for the morning after. It is safer than the street, but still loud and chaotic, and sometimes violent. Several people had died in the shelter â€“ probably of drug overdoses or alcohol poisoning, although the causes of death were not determined â€“ but none since nursing care was brought in. â€œIâ€™d come inside to pass out, but I didnâ€™t want to be that person living there,â€\\x9d said Chris Mercredi, who is now at the Oaks. â€œI couldnâ€™t picture myself there. I was ashamed of myself.â€\\x9d The beds at TED have thin plastic mattresses and are arranged four to a room. There are also small lockers, even though many clients have no possessions. (I asked one man what he kept in his locker besides clothes, and his response was â€œLike what?â€\\x9d) A Shepherdsâ€™ soup kitchen serves meals across the street. Inner City Health gives its regulars laminated wallet cards giving consent for police and paramedics to take them to TED instead of taking them to hospital or the police cells. (The clients get cards because when they are picked up, they are often in no condition to consent to anything.) But in 2014, the programme became one of the cityâ€™s official alternatives to A&E, and 3,480 people came to TED who would otherwise have ended up in hospital. People in serious medical danger still go to A&E, but these days they are comparatively few. Just the transport and initial assessment in hospital would have cost $1.74m; at TED, caring for them cost $300,000. When you wake up at TED, a staff member greets you. Do you need a nurse? Housing? Do you feel like trying to detox? Or how about trying the next step, managed alcohol? Thereâ€™s a long waiting list for the MAP, but priority goes to the sickest: those whose drinking is out of control and puts them in danger, the people who have run out of options. * * * Canadaâ€™s Inuit and aboriginal people are over-represented in the ranks of alcoholics (although they are under-represented as drug addicts). One reason is poverty; another is the effect of a massive state-inflicted trauma. Tens of thousands of indigenous children were taken from their families and sent to church-run residential schools designed to westernise them by separating them from their families, language and culture. Ottawa has the highest proportion of Inuit of any major city outside Canadaâ€™s north. â€œThey come here and might not have a plan, and end up on the street,â€\\x9d said Bartolo. Simeonie Kunnuk, like many of the homeless alcoholics in Ottawa, has a history of horror. He was sent to a residential school, where he was raped for the first time at seven years old. Sexual and physical abuse continued for years. Kunnuk came to the Oaks in April 2015, and has drastically cut down on his drinking, but the memories still trigger the desire for alcohol. â€œItâ€™s best not thinking too hard about it,â€\\x9d he said. Kunnuk spent 20 years collecting recyclables, making enough to buy his Black Bull malt liquor (a 10% beer). His daily intake was four litre bottles for $15, plus a can of sardines and a loaf of bread. In November 2014, he woke up at TED after a binge and Ray MacQuatt asked if he felt ready for the managed alcohol programme. â€œWhat time do they start drinking?â€\\x9d Kunnuk asked. He had no possessions; he simply walked upstairs. But it felt like a different world. MAP, by then, had increased its size only slightly, to 12 residents. He had his own bed. There was medical care and mental health care. There were activities and counselling and, of course, the hourly pour. Chris Mercredi, who came to the Oaks in October 2015, grew up in a trailer in rural Alberta with two severely alcoholic parents. The family ate bread made of flour fried with lard, and the rabbits his mother hunted. His sister was forced into prostitution â€“ he remembers one day when she triumphantly came home with a bag of groceries, including white bread and hot dogs. Mercrediâ€™s little brother, who used to climb into his bed for comfort, was separated from him when they both went into foster care. Mercredi was abused in the foster system, and started drinking at 18. He is 56, but perhaps the only person in the Oaks who looks younger than his age. He has a full head of hair dyed black, and a salt-and-pepper moustache. He is always neatly and colourfully dressed, with arms full of beaded and chain bracelets. He spoke softly and carefully, clicking his teeth repeatedly, his eye on the clock until it was time to get his pour. Although a heavy drinker, Mercredi had been employed in home renovation and furniture assembly until a work accident crushed his right arm. He had a steady boyfriend, Lee Crapeau, and worked as a dishwasher making $60 per day â€“ which he immediately spent on drink. He and Lee slept in Ottawaâ€™s parks. They had been together for 36 years when Lee died, of alcohol-related illness, in November 2014. Mercredi had got sober many times. â€œOnce I went to detox and stayed 28 days, to collect my thoughts. As soon as I got out,â€\\x9d he said, â€œI went straight to the booze store to buy beer.â€\\x9d * * * Every week, the MAPâ€™s residents gather in the common room for a meeting. They get their pour, then take their mugs and sit at round, black tables. When I visited, a few men rolled loose tobacco into cigarettes. It was overheated and stuffy. One of the residents had been aggressive over the weekend, but at midmorning, no one seemed intoxicated, and the meetingâ€™s tone was perfectly civil. People sipped their drinks quietly. Steve Parker from Shepherds and Amanda MacNaughtan of Inner City Health led the meeting while Annabelle, MacNaughtanâ€™s golden retriever, provided a consoling presence. â€œThereâ€™s been quite a few bottles of non-beverage alcohol found in your dorms,â€\\x9d said MacNaughtan. â€œListerine is only 99 cents,â€\\x9d said a tall man. â€œSometimes itâ€™s our last resort.â€\\x9d The discussion turned to comments from residents. â€œMore alcohol!â€\\x9d one man called. But residents also asked for milk. And movie night with popcorn. And a trip to an Ottawa Redblacks football game. And a visit to a museum exhibit of Inuit carvings. On a wall-list of requests for programmes or activities, someone wrote â€œdocumentary nightsâ€\\x9d and â€œyoga/relaxation classesâ€\\x9d. Next to it was an invitation to join an aboriginal carving empowerment circle. I was reminded that once upon a time, these patients had families, careers, talents. Muckle recalled driving some residents to visit a patient who was hospitalised, listening to them sing along heartily to an opera CD. One of Inner City Healthâ€™s first patients, Normee Ekoomiak, was a renowned Inuit artist, with work hanging in the Canadian Museum of History. Annie Iola, a resident of the Oaks, was a documentary film-maker and had studied to become a pilot. Kunnuk had worked for the National Inuit Organization, where he wrote a regular column answering questions about Inuit culture. Lots of people in Ottawa would appreciate free football tickets. And yoga classes. And a bed and free food. And, of course, wine served up every hour. And Little Rayâ€™s Reptile Zoo does sound interesting. But many of these residents have alcohol-related brain damage, and other illnesses that were either a cause or result of alcoholism. They will never work. If this programme can help keep them out of crisis services, it is a bargain. And the studies say it works. A small, peer-reviewed study of the MAP, led by Tiina Podymow of Inner City Health and the University of Ottawa (Turnbull was a co-author) was published in 2006 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. â€œThen a media circus of nuclear proportions blew up,â€\\x9d said Muckle. Most of the media treated the study straight, but comedians and commenters pounced, including Jay Leno, who talked about the crazy Canadians giving free booze to homeless alcoholics. One commenter compared it to giving little girls to paedophiles. â€œHowever, by that time we had been in operation for four-and-a-half years, and none of the problems people predicted had actually happened, so it was a bit hard to mount much opposition,â€\\x9d said Muckle. â€œEven the Salvation Army â€“ the anti-alcohol crusaders â€“ said that while they could not offer that kind of programme themselves, they were a part of Inner City Health and strongly supported this programme because it had such good results.â€\\x9d Bernie Pauly, a scientist at the Centre for Addictions Research of BC, at the University of Victoria, and Tim Stockwell, the centreâ€™s director, are finishing a major study of five Canadian managed alcohol programmes. In-depth research on programmes in Vancouver and in Thunder Bay, a city of 100,000 in northwest Ontario, has found that they greatly reduced the harm of drinking. Participants drank more wine and less Listerine, and spread their drinking out over the day. They greatly improved their safety, stability, mental and physical health, housing, family relationships, life skills and self-esteem. Did they cut down on their drinking? That was not clear â€“ and it is not the focus of the programmes, strange as that might seem. Podymowâ€™s study of Ottawaâ€™s MAP had found that clients in the MAP went from an average of 46 drinks per day down to eight â€“ but that was only counting the pour; researchers were not counting how much people drank outside. Stockwell said that in the programmes he studied, people drank about as much outside as they got from the pour. Doubling the pour would still mean the Ottawa MAP was associated with a huge drop in drinking. In Thunder Bay, some participants reported that they had fewer no-drinking days than did people still on the street, probably because they had regular access to alcohol, which they would not have if they were broke or in prison. What seemed clear was that they were managing it better and suffering less. * * * Those who do well in the MAP can move on to the Oaks, living in one of the converted hotel rooms in the orange-and-cream four-storey building, with a small outdoor space in the back and, importantly, a gate, so staff know who is leaving and who is coming in. Residents are a self-selected group â€“ â€œthose who donâ€™t want to be around this craziness any moreâ€\\x9d, said Turnbull. â€œThey want to reconnect with family, they want a dog, a garden, a Christmas party.â€\\x9d Every year, residents pile into vans to drive outside the city to the farm where Turnbull lives. With chainsaws and tractors, the men cut down three trees to take back to the Oaks for the annual Christmas party, to which the Oaks invites city officials, and residents invite their once-estranged families. It is a huge event, a celebration of normality. Decorating starts just after Halloween. Everyone I talked to at the Oaks said they had drunk outside the programme when they first arrived. They would buy liquor and try to sneak it into their rooms. Oaks staff try to police them: they persuaded the nearby dollar store to take the Listerine and rubbing alcohol off the shelves and put them behind the counter. â€œWe suspect everyone who goes out,â€\\x9d said Young. â€œTheyâ€™re searched to make sure theyâ€™re not carrying it in, but they hide bottles in the bushes. More recent admissions are battling these little demons, the call to go outside and drink. In a year we wonâ€™t see those behaviours.â€\\x9d â€œI gave up on trying to outsmart them,â€\\x9d said Kunnuk. â€œI didnâ€™t realise they knew where we went. Iâ€™d put the wine on the gate at the corner, come in, and go around the back and take it. But they could tell,â€\\x9d he said. Like users of all long-term shelters in Canada, people at the Oaks pay for their housing and food by signing over their disability cheques. Rooms are large and comfortable, but most people spend their time in the lobby. Bright orange walls display their art, photographs and poems. There are televisions, computers and a piano. When I visited, the Oaks was in the middle of a bedbug extermination campaign. Furniture was piled against the lobby walls and side rooms were stuffed with plastic bags of clean clothes. Residents do have some cash: about $40 each month from their personal benefits after paying for the pour, cable television and, if they smoke, tobacco. If someone is caught spending their allowance on booze, MacQuatt steps in to hold it. They then have to come to him during set banking hours to ask for their money, and tell him what they plan to buy. For some at the Oaks, the change of habits came too late to save their liver or heart. Stockwell said that people with this level of alcohol use tend to die 25 years younger than people who donâ€™t have alcohol problems â€“ but the death rate is much higher among those who continue their lives of rough sleeping and binge drinking. Turnbull talks about finding a way to bring younger people into the programme, before drink has caused irreparable damage. But younger people do not feel comfortable in the Oaks, which Muckle called â€œa nursing home of sorts, with alcoholâ€\\x9d. Windsor is one of the youngest residents â€“ not yet 40, and less marked by drink than many of the others. On Saturdays, he goes downtown to beg and buys two or three bottles of pale dry sherry. Heâ€™ll drink two at night and save one for the morning. He stays at TED. Heâ€™d like to get his old job at the moving company back and continue drinking on Saturday nights. He still cooks his grandmotherâ€™s recipes â€“ cooking is a marker of normal life for many people. He makes spaghetti sauce for the Oaks and recently represented the Oaks in Shepherdsâ€™ annual chilli cook-off. He is mayor of the Oaks, responsible for representing residents in regular meetings with MacQuatt. Chris Mercredi left the MAP in October for the Oaks. He is the only Oaks resident who is actually non-resident; he lives in a cheap apartment nearby, but he still spends the day at the Oaks. When I first met him he told me he had been getting drunk whenever he had money, but not any more. â€œI can definitely say the apartment comes first,â€\\x9d he said. He wants furniture. He wants to start cooking again â€“ he always cooked for Lee. He wants a kitten. Through the programme, Mercredi had a bed, a roof, food, good medical care, a place to sit and listen to his music. With time, he might follow the pattern and reduce his consumption. He was still getting over Leeâ€™s death. The first thing Mercredi did in his apartment was tape Leeâ€™s photo to the refrigerator. He talks to it every day. â€œEvery time I pass it, I say, â€˜I love you, I miss you,â€™â€\\x9d he said, kissing his fingers and dabbing the air. The next time I saw him, though, he was drunk at 11am. He had borrowed $20 from his landlord, saying he needed it for food. He bought two bottles of beer and two bottles of Imperial sherry. He drank the beer and one Imperial before he got home, and then half of the second Imperial. Then he passed out. â€œI was so happy to see that bottle beside my bed when I woke up,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI woke up light-headed and had a drink, which really relieved me. The wine here â€“ it helps. But itâ€™s not as much as I want to drink. Alcohol is what I need in my system, my gasoline, my energy drink. I have to have that bottle in my hand.â€\\x9d I told MacQuatt later that I had found the way Mercredi talked about drink â€“ the raw need and longing in his voice â€“ painful to hear. He paused for a long time. â€œWe know alcohol is very important to our residents. Itâ€™s the number-one thing,â€\\x9d he finally said; thatâ€™s why we need this programme. â€œWe just want to see improvement. If theyâ€™re going out every day and getting intoxicated, weâ€™d say theyâ€™re not ready. But for someone like Mercredi to go out and get intoxicated one day is par for the course. Heâ€™s doing great.â€\\x9d Travel for this article was funded by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting â€¢ Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.',\n",
              "  'NHS saves Â£600m in crackdown on agency fees The NHS has slashed more than Â£600m from the billions it pays every year for temporary doctors and nurses by cracking down on fees paid to â€œrip-offâ€\\x9d staffing agencies, new figures reveal. Gaps in hospital rotas sent the bill for temporary staff soaring from Â£2.2bn in 2009-10 to Â£3.6bn last year. But hospitals have halted the relentless increase in recent years of the rates for stand-in personnel needed to ease chronic understaffing and ensure patient safety on wards. Data compiled by NHS Improvement, which regulates the health service in England, shows that hospitals spent Â£613m less since the blitz on agency staff began on 15 October last year, compared to the 12 months before caps on hourly rates were brought in. In August, for example, NHS trusts spent Â£252m on agency staff â€“ Â£61m (19.5%) less than the Â£313m they paid out in the same month the year before. Similarly, in July they spent Â£256m compared to their Â£331m outlay in July 2015. If maintained, the NHS stands to meet its target of spending Â£1bn less a year on temporary staff, which would be key to its ambition to reduce hospitalsâ€™ collective overspend of Â£2.5bn last year to Â£580m. Hospitals are now paying 18% less on average for nurses whom they hire through agencies which NHS England boss Simon Stevens last year criticised for â€œripping off the NHSâ€\\x9d. The limits on fees for stand-ins have also succeeded in reducing the cost of locum doctors, but only by 13%. Jim Mackey, NHS Improvementâ€™s chief executive, will cite the figures as proof that the NHS is making progress at controlling its costs when he, Stevens and health secretary Jeremy Hunt give evidence to MPs on the Commons health select committee on Tuesday. Medical organisations reacted with alarm to disclosures that Theresa May, the prime minister, has told Stevens that, despite mounting concern that the NHS is under dangerous strain, it would not receive any extra funding when Philip Hammond, the chancellor, presents his autumn statement on 23 November. â€œIf these reports are true, the prime minister needs to explain how exactly the NHS will keep up with rising demand without the necessary investment. â€œTheresa May talks about injecting Â£10bn into the NHS, yet in reality the increase in health spending is less than half that,â€\\x9d said Dr Anthea Mowat, a spokeswoman for the British Medical Association. â€œThe NHS is already the most efficient healthcare system in the world. The notion that the funding crisis can be solved with further efficiency savings is a myth, and these are not savings, they are year-on-year cuts that have driven almost every acute trust in England into deficit, led to a crisis in general practice and a community and social care system on the brink of collapse,â€\\x9d added Mowat. Two-thirds of the acute, mental health, community services and ambulance trusts covered by the new rules on agency staff had cut the amount of money they spend on them, NHS Improvement said. Since April trusts have only been allowed to pay 55% more than the usual rate for the job for temporary workers, though they are allowed to breach that supposed ceiling â€œon exceptional safety groundsâ€\\x9d in order to ensure that patients do not come to harm because of staff shortages. However, Mackey recently told trusts that, despite the progress on agency fees, â€œacross the sector we are falling short of what is needed and must do more to reduce over-reliance on agenciesâ€\\x9d. The regulator will soon start to publish quarterly updates on how much each trust has spent on such staff in what some in the NHS see as a crude â€œnaming and shamingâ€\\x9d exercise designed to embarrass trusts into spending less and do not take account of high vacancy rates which force them to turn to agencies in the first place. It also plans to phase out altogether hospitalsâ€™ use of expensive interim senior executives, whose temporary costs can see them being paid over Â£1,000 a day. â€œReducing spending on the agency bill is fundamentally important for NHS finances. But itâ€™s not a panacea,â€\\x9d said Anita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation thinktank, Hospitals are still heading for an overspend of Â£580m this year despite receiving Â£1.8bn of â€œsustainability and transformationâ€\\x9d funding, and NS England has made only â€œslow progressâ€\\x9d at finding its promised Â£22bn of efficiency savings, she warned. â€œReducing the agency bill will help but itâ€™s not the solution. The NHS needs a comprehensive plan to improve efficiency,â€\\x9d she added. â€œThe NHS has saved over Â£600m since we introduced our agency price cap system. Most NHS trusts have responded well to the caps, using them to significantly reduce their agency spending and improve their workforce management,â€\\x9d said Dr Kathy McLean, NHS Improvementâ€™s executive medical director.',\n",
              "  'PPI claims - all you need to know about the mis-selling scandal The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has announced a June 2019 deadline for customers to make claims for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Why is the deadline being imposed? The FCA says imposing a deadline would allow banks to draw a line under the PPI scandal, which has been dragging on for years. Estimates by New City Agenda puts the total bill for handling claims at more than Â£37bn while the FCA calculates that Â£24.2bn has been paid out to consumers since 2011, the rest being the cost of tackling claims plus provisions made in anticipation of more payouts. When did the mis-selling of PPI begin? PPI has been sold alongside mortgages, credit cards and other unsecured loans since the 1990s. It was supposed to cover payments on loans if customers fell ill or lost their jobs. In 2004, the reported how Barclays had been making profits from PPI and other examples quickly followed. It received new prominence in 2005 when Citizens Advice issued a so-called super-complaint to competition watchdogs about what it described as a â€œprotection racketâ€\\x9d, starting a series of events that led to the compensation payments to consumers and sales of some types of PPI being banned. How many customers are affected? The now defunct Financial Services Authority told parliament 53m PPI policies had been sold. Around 45m of those were sold by banks, worth around Â£44bn. It is not clear how many of these policies were mis-sold â€“ initial estimates by the FCA were that 3m people were affected â€“ but by January 2016 12m customers had received compensation, totalling Â£24.2bn. Selling PPI was very profitable for banks. In its evidence to parliament, the regulator highlighted one PPI policy sold alongside a mortgage which cost the customer Â£20,838 over the loan term even though the maximum they could reclaim was Â£31,000, an illustration of the scale of profits involved which led banks to risk mis-selling. Is the deadline the same for all customers? The consumer panel, which represents consumer interests at the FCA, questioned the deadline. In its submission to the FCA about a time bar, it pointed out that 5.5m customers may already face an earlier cut-off. This is because they have already been contacted by their banks and, if they are covered by existing rules, will already have the clock ticking on a three-year time limit for claims. How many more claims do the banks face? Given the cold-calling from claims management companies (CMCs) it might seem improbable that anyone who was mis-sold a policy has not already made a claim. However, according to the the Professional Financial Claims Association (PFCA), only about half of the sums paid out represent refunded payments. The rest is interest, with the banks obliged to pay 8% interest on the money being returned. This suggests an even higher bill for PPI . Guy Anker, managing editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, points out that the Financial Ombudsman is upholding 70% of complaints rejected by banks. â€œTo go to the ombudsman you have to first complain to the bank, so itâ€™s likely banks are still wrongly rejecting claims from over half of those who have been mis-sold,â€\\x9d said Anker. Are there any new twists? A court ruling in the Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance case also looks likely to add to the PPI bill. The court concluded that if a PPI seller failed to disclose to a customer that it had received a large commission from the product provider, the sale was unfair under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. The case involved Susan Plevin, who found that 72% of the Â£5,780 premium she paid was commission for the lender and the broker that sold her the loan, with the rest going to the PPI provider, Norwich Union. How much will I get if I claim? That will depend on your circumstances, but the average is Â£2,000. The BBC has reported one case of a businesswoman from Hertfordshire receiving Â£65,000 from her credit card company MBNA. Moneysavingexpert has one example of an Â£82,000 payout to a Barclaycard customer. What is happening to claims now? Lloyds Banking Group, which sold more PPI policies than any other bank, said claims in the last week had reached their lowest weekly level since the highpoint of 2011. It is still receiving 6,700 claims a week â€“ down from 10,000 per week in the past. Over the past six weeks, PPI complaints fell to 7,500 per week from an average of 8,500 in the first half of 2016. What happens next? The FCA will run a consultation until 11 October before finalising the rules. Consumer experts reckon that CMCs â€“ which the National Audit Office estimates have received up to Â£5bn in commission from PPI payments â€“ will make extra efforts to generate claims for consumers. The banks will also have to agree to spend Â£40m on an awareness campaign to ensure customers make claims before the deadline. Anker said customers who had previous claims rejected should contact the Ombudsman if they have not already done so. â€œBanks have been fined for poor complaints handling â€“ your bank rejection does not mean you werenâ€™t mis-sold.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Sadiq Khan and Anne Hidalgo rebuke Donald Trump over Muslim ban The mayor of Paris has joined with her newly elected London counterpart, Sadiq Khan, in voicing a scathing rebuke of Donald Trump over his call for a ban on Muslims entering the US and his suggestions that an â€œexceptionâ€\\x9d could be made in the case of Khan. Standing alongside Khan at St Pancras railway station after arriving from Paris, Anne Hidalgo said on Tuesday that people of all religions, including Catholics and Muslims, did not agree with the US presidential candidate, adding: â€œMr Trump is so stupid, my God, my God.â€\\x9d Khan, Londonâ€™s first Muslim mayor, said he hoped that Trump looked at the lessons from last weekâ€™s Londonâ€™s mayoral elections â€œand recognises that itâ€™s possible to be western and Muslim and to be friends with a mayor of Paris as wellâ€\\x9d. He added: â€œOur message to Donald Trump is: this is how you work together; this is the best of humanity; this is the best of the west. â€œWhatâ€™s really important is the similarities Paris and London have; they are the most diverse cities in the world. This is an example of the best of our cities â€“ men, women, Muslims, Christians, mayors working together to work for our cities, solving the housing crisis, fixing the air quality, addressing the challenges of integration and making sure our cities are safe.â€\\x9d The two mayors held talks at the station on a number of issues which were thought to include security. Khan later tweeted images of what he said would be the first of many meetings between the two. Khan has previously said he would visit the US before this yearâ€™s presidential elections â€œin case Donald Trump winsâ€\\x9d and Muslims were banned. The London mayor subsequently rebuffed a suggestion by Trump that he could be an exception to the proposed ban. He said the ban was something that directly affected those closest to him and making an exception was not the answer. Trump told the New York Times on Monday that he was happy to see Khan elected as mayor of London last week. â€œThere will always be exceptions,â€\\x9d he said of his proposed temporary ban on Muslims. Of Khanâ€™s election, he said: â€œI think itâ€™s a very good thing and I hope he does a very good job because, frankly. that would be very, very good. You lead by example, always lead by example. If he does a good job and, frankly, if he does a great job, that would be a terrific thing.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Jeremy Corbyn to urge Labour voters to focus ire on Tories, not the EU Jeremy Corbyn will use a speech in London to urge Labour voters to lay the blame for pressures on housing, jobs and the NHS at the door of the Conservatives, instead of seizing on the EU as a scapegoat. As the referendum campaign steps up a gear, with Britain Stronger in Europe saying it plans to hold 1,000 events over the weekend, the Labour leader, a long-time sceptic when it comes to the EU, will tell his audience at a rally on Saturday that voting to leave would not help tackle the UKâ€™s problems. â€œPeople in this country face many problems, from insecure jobs, low pay and unaffordable housing to stagnating living standards, environmental degradation, and the responsibility for them lies in 10 Downing Street, not in Brussels,â€\\x9d he will say. â€œThis country is being let down by a Conservative government that is failing on housing, failing our children, failing our NHS, failing to create good quality secure jobs and consistently failing even to meet its own economic targets.â€\\x9d The main party leaders will be out pushing for a remain vote this weekend, with David Cameron unveiling a new campaign poster and the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, meeting voters in Kendal. Corbynâ€™s deputy, Tom Watson, will take the Labour in for Britain battlebus through the West Midlands, visiting Telford, Wolverhampton and Birmingham. Cameron said: â€œThis is a day unlike any other: politicians of every stripe taking to the streets with the same message. Because we face a vote unlike any other, one which will shape our country for decades â€“ even generations â€“ to come.â€\\x9d Robert Oxley, of Vote Leave, said the remain camp were â€œplaying catch-upâ€\\x9d. He claimed he had 20,000 activists signed up to get involved, and said Cameron, whose party is deeply split on the issue of Europe, was relying on Labour ground troops to win the referendum. â€œMost of the in campaign is based around Labour, but being told by No 10 what to do,â€\\x9d he said. Labour voters, particularly younger ones, are regarded as crucial to achieving a remain vote on 23 June, and senior figures in Stronger In are concerned that Corbyn has been too reticent about making the case. However, his team are anxious about the possibility of being seen to ally themselves too closely with the Conservatives. The collapse of Labourâ€™s support in Scotland followed its decision to mount a joint push against independence with the Conservatives, led by Alistair Darling, in the 2014 referendum. Labour was pushed into third place in the Holyrood parliament, behind the Conservatives, in last weekâ€™s elections. With polling out of the way in Scottish, Welsh and local elections, senior Labour figures have switched their focus to the referendum. The former party leaders Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband have made speeches, and Tony Blair is expected to make his own intervention in June. Corbyn will say that a Labour government would use Britainâ€™s EU membership to press for different priorities across the continent, including improving workersâ€™ rights. â€œWhen Labour comes into government we will work with our allies across the continent to reform the European Union to increase democratic accountability to strengthen workersâ€™ rights and the scope for public enterprise ... and to work together to tackle issues like tax avoidance and climate change,â€\\x9d he will say. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, became the latest policymaker to issue a warning about the consequences of a Brexit on Friday, saying they could range from â€œpretty bad to very, very badâ€\\x9d. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said a vote to leave could trigger a recession.',\n",
              "  'Iain Duncan Smith asks civil servants to ignore block on EU papers Iain Duncan Smith has asked civil servants in the welfare and pensions department to ignore a directive from the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, which stops pro-Brexit ministers seeing government papers related to the EU referendum. In a further escalation of the row at the heart of the cabinet, the work and pensions secretary also encouraged other senior ministers who are campaigning to leave the EU to do the same. The move will be seen as a direct challenge to David Cameronâ€™s authority, with with senior civil servants warning the row threatens the governmentâ€™s ability to function properly. It has emerged hours after Heywood told MPs that it was the civil serviceâ€™s â€œconstitutional dutyâ€\\x9d to support the governmentâ€™s position, even if this meant restricting access for ministers who planned to campaign to leave the EU. On the floor of the House of Commons, cabinet minister Matthew Hancock said it was an essential approach as it was the â€œduty of the civil service to support the governmentâ€\\x9d, which is in favour of staying in the EU. A source close to Duncan Smith confirmed reports that he would ask civil servants in his department to show him all papers related to the EU. â€œHe has asserted his constitutional right to see everything produced in his department â€“ including things related to the EU,â€\\x9d the source said. Earlier on Monday, Priti Patel, the employment minister, who sits in cabinet, was the first to accuse Heywood of an â€œunconstitutional actâ€\\x9d that â€œthreatens the reputation of the civil serviceâ€\\x9d. â€œSecretaries of state are responsible for their departments. For an unelected official to prevent them being aware of the information they need for their duties is wrong,â€\\x9d she said. Appearing before the public accounts committee, Heywood said that far from being unconstitutional, the civil service was upholding its primary role of carrying out government policy. â€œWhat my letter does is put flesh on the bones of the prime ministerâ€™s own letter of the 11 January saying the government would have a position on this subject. â€œThe government having a position on it, it is the civil serviceâ€™s constitutional duty to support the governmentâ€™s position. The unusual part of this is that the prime minister is allowing several ministers in the cabinet and elsewhere to oppose that government policy,â€\\x9d he said. â€œCivil servants wonâ€™t provide briefing and speech material for those who want to argue against the governmentâ€™s position, but in every other respect they will get the full service that you would expect. It is not bypassing anybody.â€\\x9d The government faced further scrutiny in an emergency Commons debate, where pro-Brexit Tory MPs claimed it could compromise the civil serviceâ€™s duty of honesty. Bernard Jenkin, a leading Tory Eurosceptic, led the rebellion with an urgent question to the government, saying the limits went further than those imposed on ministers on 1975 and created a worse atmosphere. â€œNobody objects to the government making its case in this referendum but most people expect the civil service to be impartial in carrying out its support for ministers,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIt is established in law that ministers are accountable for their departments and voters expect government facts and figures to be impartial and accurate whether they are used by ministers who support remain or leave. â€œSo why does the cabinet secretaryâ€™s letter go far beyond the limits actually placed on dissenting ministers during the 1975 referendum?â€\\x9d He was backed up by numerous colleagues campaigning for the UK to leave, including Julian Lewis, the Tory chair of the defence committee, who said the public would see â€œbig battalionsâ€\\x9d of civil servants and spin doctors lined up on one side of the argument. Gerald Howarth, the former defence minister, said it was a â€œconstitutional outrageâ€\\x9d and might give the impression that the government was â€œtrying to rig the referendumâ€\\x9d. Andrew Percy, the Tory MP for Brigg and Goole, also said it was â€œleading people to believe there is a stitch-up to keep us in the EUâ€\\x9d. The criticism was not limited to those arguing for the UK to leave the EU, with a number of Labour MPs raising concerns that the decision would undermine trust in the referendum. Tom Watson, Labourâ€™s deputy leader, challenged the government to give its ministers free rein to run their departments or sack those campaigning against its policy. In response to the furore, Hancock, the paymaster general, said: â€œAll ministers can ask for factual briefing and for facts to be checked in any matter. All ministers can see documents on EU issues not related to the referendum question, as normal. â€œSo the guidance is clear, itâ€™s published and the process was agreed at cabinet as the best way to manage the unusual situation of ministers who disagree with the government remaining in post.â€\\x9d Ministers arguing over the role of mandarins in the run-up to the EU referendum have been warned by the union for senior civil servants that this could cause lasting damage to relationships across Whitehall. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the main union representing senior civil servants, said government splits over access to documents might have long-term repercussions for the way in which ministers and their officials interacted. In the short term, it could stop government functioning properly, he said. â€œPoliticiansâ€™ continued wrangling over this issue will only serve to impact upon the smooth running of government and damage the essential relationship between civil servants and ministers.â€\\x9d He appeared to dismiss criticism from pro-Brexit ministers who claimed that Heywoodâ€™s edict would leave civil servants facing a conflict of interest. â€œThe FDA welcomes the clear guidance issued by Sir Jeremy Heywood, which clarifies the responsibilities of ministers and civil servants,â€\\x9d Penman said.',\n",

Flumeâ€™s second album, Skin, which he is touring through the US and Europe, won in all three artisan categories on Wednesday: best producer, engineer and cover art of the year. Appearing over video message, he also announced that he will be performing at the November ceremony, where he will be competing for the nightâ€™s top awards â€“ including album of the year, best male artist, best dance release and the Apple Music song of the year â€“ a new category voted for by Apple Music subscribers. In 2013 the producer was nominated in seven categories for his debut self-titled record, and won in four. Speaking to Australia this year, Flume described the follow-up process as â€œincredibly stressfulâ€\\x9d. â€œI put a lot of pressure on myself to have my music at a certain quality, and that wasnâ€™t a positive thing,â€\\x9d he said. â€œSkin was a totally different experience than the first record. It didnâ€™t just come.â€\\x9d The 2016 nominations were also dominated by YouTube star-turned-pop artist Troye Sivan, who was nominated for two artisan awards and will be competing with Flume in five categories on the night: artist of the year, male artist, pop release, Apple Music song of the year and best video. Released last year, Sivanâ€™s debut album, Blue Neighbourhood, was awarded five stars by the Australian music critic Everett True. â€œSivan and his equally youthful co-writer-producer, Alex Hope, have such a natural flair for capturing the sound of now that in a yearâ€™s time he could well be sharing the stratosphere with Taylor Swift,â€\\x9d True wrote. The pop artist Sia, the hip-hop artist Illy and the long-awaited return of the Avalanches have brought in six nominations apiece, with King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, RÃœFÃœS and Violent Soho each nominated in five categories. Courtney Barnett, who was nominated for eight Arias in 2015 and won four, is up for two public-voted categories in 2016: best video for Elevator Operator, and best live act.

              "  \"Swipe magazine: will millennials read 'the best of the web' in print? If you live in one of Londonâ€™s hipper areas or commute into its centre, you may have been approached this morning at the tube station by a young person in a blue T-shirt handing out yet another free magazine. Aimed at the almost mythical millennial the media is obsessed with, Swipe magazine aims to stand out from Time Out or Shortlistby offering â€œthe best of the internet in printâ€\\x9d. The premise makes sense, on paper at least. People like reading print, but thereâ€™s loads of good stuff on the internet. So much in fact, that itâ€™s hard to keep track of it all and find the best bits. Swipeâ€™s editors say they will sift through that morass of content, decide which bits its target audience will like, then shove it in their face on their commute. They are paying a not exactly generous 10p per word to writers, but the 70-odd contributing sites get promotion for their work. It has an initial distribution of 20,000 copies, 17,000 by hand and the rest placed in coffee shops and other millennial-friendly hubs. Publisher Tom Rendell insists that outside a media bubble of super-engaged web users, there is demand for a print roundup that filters social media. â€œThe internet is 4.5bn pages,â€\\x9d he said. â€œItâ€™s completely dominated by huge sites high in Google search rankings. Weâ€™re not picking the most popular or the weirdest â€“ we are looking at this with a journalistic background and thinking how we can give the best experience.â€\\x9d That experience is a mixed bag of articles. A beautifully illustrated cover story on the â€œdangerous bromanceâ€\\x9d between Trump and Putin from startup site the Malcontent (run by a former Telegraph journalist) that makes good use of graffiti depicting the odd couple kissing. News stories from Business Insider and its tech offshoot, a long read from â€œdeep webâ€\\x9d publisher Vocativ and, and weirdly, a Wikihow article about how to have a wolf as a pet. The ads are also revealing. A big sponsored content opener from Uber on the inside page, another sponsored article about a â€œdeveloper bootcampâ€\\x9d and on the back page, a mail order craft beer brewery. Ticking off each entry in the millennial lifestyle checklist. Itâ€™s all prefaced with a â€œTrendingâ€\\x9d section covering social media such as the Phil from EastEnders meme making the rounds (Utter Philth), a reference to the Chewbacca mask video, and a roundup of Instagram and Twitter posts of the week. Some of the choices, however, suggest the publishers are aiming for the slightly older end of their millennial target market. News that a sequel to 1999 rave film Human Traffic is on the cards wonâ€™t mean much to anyone under 30. And the â€œTwitter of the weekâ€\\x9d section includes an (admittedly hilarious) tweet from 2013. This clearly isnâ€™t a magazine for the web-obsessed, head-in-their-smartphone twentysomething. And that may be the point. There are plenty of outlets that curate the best of the web online, and most of those who are swimming through the internetâ€™s eddies regularly will almost certainly have already identified their favourite ones, or just use their social media feeds to find what will interest them. One colleague at the upper range of the millennial demographic put it, â€œItâ€™s like an in-flight magazine for the internetâ€\\x9d. Another at the other end of the age range said: â€œlike anyone picking it up being I LIKE THIS, might, you know, go on the internetâ€\\x9d. But then for those for whom the more distant reaches of the web beyond Facebook and Twitter (Tumblr anyone?) are more like a foreign country, Swipe can offer a way to ensure they arenâ€™t completely out of touch with the kids.\",\n",
              "  'Is the leave campaign really telling six lies? David Cameron has accused the leave campaign of telling six â€œtotal untruthsâ€\\x9d in the space of a few days. So who is right â€“ the prime minister or those campaigning for Brexit? No eurozone bailouts Cameron: â€œThey said we are liable to bail out eurozone countries. Not true. My renegotiation means we are categorically not liable for eurozone bailouts.â€\\x9d Heâ€™s right on this one. The UKâ€™s â€œspecial statusâ€\\x9d deal secured by the prime minister in February includes a guarantee that countries outside the eurozone will not be required to fund bailouts within the currency zone. Even before February, the UK was off the hook for eurozone bailouts. After the Greek debt crisis, EU finance ministers rewrote an EU regulation to guarantee that non-euro countries would be repaid for any losses incurred if a bailed-out country defaulted on its loans. 2 The rebate Cameron: â€œThey said that our rebate, the money that we get back from the EU, is at risk. Again, not true.â€\\x9d The UKâ€™s headline contribution to the EU budget is reduced because of the rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Leave campaigners, such as Michael Gove, have argued the UK rebate is at risk because it is not written into EU treaties. While it is true that it is not written in, however, leave campaigners ignore the fact that EU budgets are agreed by unanimity. Other EU countries have tried and failed to scrap the rebate in the face of opposition from the British government. The EU budget for 2014-20 is already decided, so the rebate will not be on the table for several years. 3. The veto Cameron: â€œThey said weâ€™ve given up our ability to veto EU treaties. Again, not true.â€\\x9d EU treaties only enter into force when they are agreed and ratified by all member states. There is nothing in the UK reform deal that changes that. 4 The budget Cameron: â€œThey said we had no ability to stop overall EU spending from going up. Again, not true.â€\\x9d European leaders agreed to cut EU spending for the first time when they agreed the EUâ€™s long-term budget in 2013. Cameron is correct to say he negotiated this cut, though he overlooks the role of key allies, especially the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Whether Britain could have managed this on its own is not clear. 5. The EU army Cameron: â€œThey said we were powerless to stop Britain being forced in to an EU army. Again, not true.â€\\x9d The prime minister is on safer territory here: there is no realistic or imminent prospect of an EU army. Some officials in Brussels might like to see one, but there is no appetite for this among member states. Cameron is also correct when he says the UK has a veto on defence and security policy. However, he ignores that EU member states can choose to work together on defence. The Lisbon treaty introduced the idea of â€œpermanent structured cooperationâ€\\x9d, allowing countries to pool research, defence spending and take part in multinational forces. The UK cannot stop other countries working together, but neither would it be compelled to take part. 6. The Â£8bn savings Cameron: â€œThey [leave] said weâ€™d save Â£8bn if we left the EU. Again, not true.â€\\x9d This is another open goal for the prime minister. Michael Gove claimed a post-Brexit UK would have Â£8bn to spend on the NHS, as a result of no longer having to contribute to the EU budget. Now, even putting to one side the doubts over whether a Boris Johnson-Gove government would spend that money on the NHS â€“ John Major for one wasnâ€™t convinced â€“ this is an improbable scenario. The money is unlikely to be there for spending. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has concluded that â€œeven a small negative effectâ€\\x9d on the British economy from leaving the EU â€œwould damage the public finances by more than that Â£8bnâ€\\x9d. In a statement on its website, the IFS writes: â€œLeaving the EU would not, as Michael Gove claims we said, leave more money to spend on the NHS. Rather it would leave us spending less on public services, or taxing more, or borrowing more.â€\\x9d Verdict: EU truth-teller-come-lately Cameron may be guilty of exaggerating his own role, but his six statements are all true. He could even have gone further by taking on some of leaveâ€™s other misleading claims: the Â£2.4bn increase in UK contributions (not true); the Â£350m a week being sent to the EU (misleading, says the UKâ€™s statistics watchdog); Turkeyâ€™s imminent EU membership (totally implausible) or Boris Johnsonâ€™s reckless comparison of the EUâ€™s goals with those of Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the biggest problem is that Cameron has come late to challenging euro myths. In his Bloomberg speech, the prime minister complained about the EUâ€™s â€œcumbersome rigidityâ€\\x9d and â€œinsistence on a one-size-fits-all approachâ€\\x9d, glossing over the fact the UK has won numerous opt-outs, while the EU has been taking a more British approach to regulation for several years. The difficulty for the remain side is that no British prime minister has taken on eurosceptic claims for a long time. And now time is running out.',\n",
              "  'Affordable housing crisis has engulfed all cities in southern England, says Lloyds There is no longer a city in the south of England where house prices are less than seven and a half times average local incomes, according to analysis by Lloyds Bank that reveals how the home affordability crisis now stretches far beyond London. â€œThe housing affordability gap has widened to its worst level in eight years,â€\\x9d said the Lloyds analysis, noting that the last time prices were so high was at the very top of the boom in 2008, just before the financial crisis struck. The Lloyds analysis is unique in that it compares local house prices with local earnings rather than national averages. On this measure, the worst house prices are not in London but in other parts of the south-east. Oxford is again identified as the least affordable city in the UK, with average prices at 10.68 times local earnings. Winchester is a close second at 10.54, with London third at 10.06. Cambridge, Brighton and Bath all have prices that are now nearly 10 times local earnings, while cities such as Bristol and Southampton have prices close to eight times earnings. Wage growth has fallen far behind the rise in house prices, said Lloyds, with affordability worsening for the third successive year. The average home in a city in the UK now costs 6.6 times average local earnings, up from 6.2 last year. In the 1950s and 1960s, buyers could typically find homes with mortgages of three to four times their income. But the Lloyds figures show that there is now just one city in the UK that fits that profile: Derry in Northern Ireland. House prices in the city currently fetch 3.81 times local incomes. While most of the â€œmost affordableâ€\\x9d cities in the Lloyds rankings are in the north, Scotland and Northern Ireland, buyers will still be stretched to afford a home from the local salaries on offer. Hull is widely regarded as a low house price area, yet local residents face having to pay 5.11 times average local incomes to buy a home. Meanwhile, York has joined the ranks of cities in the south in the unaffordability tables, with prices at 7.5 times incomes. Winchester in Hampshire emerges as Britainâ€™s No 1 property hotspot, easily surpassing the capital in terms of house price rises and unaffordability. The local council says that soaring house prices have pushed locally born people out of the city, while finding workers to fill lower-paid jobs is proving extremely difficult. â€œItâ€™s a very big challenge for the council,â€\\x9d says Stephen Godfrey, leader of Winchester council, where the local unemployment rate is just 0.6%. â€œWe have more jobs here than the local working age population. Many public services jobs are not the highest salary payers, and it is difficult to find people willing to take local jobs at these wages. Of the councilâ€™s 450 staff, only half live in the district.â€\\x9d House prices have grown faster in Winchester than anywhere in the UK over the past decade, said Lloyds, jumping from an average of Â£249,703 in 2006 to Â£446,796. One eight-bed home is currently on the market for Â£6.5m, while new-build two-bed flats have asking prices of Â£595,000. The capital of Alfred the Greatâ€™s kingdom was recently named by the Sunday Times as the greatest place to live in Britain, and boasts a Michelin-starred restaurant, the countryâ€™s first Hotel du Vin and highly rated local schools. Seven direct trains to London Waterloo leave between 7am-8am each weekday morning â€“ but finding a seat is another matter. Godfrey said that around 400-500 new homes a year are being built in the area, and that a new council house-building programme will provide another 120 units. But the developments will be unlikely to meet demand â€“ or objections from existing residents, many angry at how the town is being swamped by Londoners selling up and using gains in the capital to snap up local homes. â€œEveryone knows that Winchester houses are very expensive, even â€˜affordableâ€™ ones. Londoners love our beautiful city, gorgeous countryside, great rail links and it so much cheaper than London even if they commute. They can afford expensive property when they sell up in London and move here,â€\\x9d one resident told the Hampshire Chronicle.',\n",
              "  \"Shakin' Stevens: 'I'm like a skittle. If I get knocked down I get back up again' Hi Shaky! Should people be surprised that the biggest name in 80s chart-topping rockabilly pop has made an album of socially conscious, dark Americana? (1) People have been surprised. Weâ€™ve been playing it to them and not telling them who it is. Iâ€™m really pleased with it. Why is it so dark? I got to a certain age and realised I knew nothing about my family history, â€™cos when youâ€™re growing up itâ€™s all hush hush. So I started digging around and it was shocking. One of my ancestors was blown up in the first world war. It took him eight days to die. My grandfather was a copper miner at the age of 10. Theyâ€™d spend hours on these ladders going down the hole. They were working in prison, no toilets. A lot went on as well, which we wonâ€™t go into. Some of them were so tired at the end of the day that theyâ€™d fall off the ladders and never wake up. So the stories lent themselves to blues, gospel, Cajun and mandolins. Mind you, wasnâ€™t the apparently cheery This Ole House (2) based on a similarly grim story? Stuart Hamblen wrote it [in 1954] about coming across the body of a prospector in a deserted shack. True story. Do you think the squillions who bought Green Door had any idea about the persistent urban myth that it was about a lesbian club (3)? I never knew that. Lovely. Thatâ€™s quite subversive really. Nick Lowe recommended I cover the song after we bumped into him in the pub. I always wondered why he was smiling. Youâ€™ve got environmental songs on the new album. Are you a bit of a politico on the sly? Thereâ€™s that infamous story about you being in the Communist party â€¦ In the very early days the guy that got us our gigs was in the Communist party. Or his parents were. So we ended up doing gigs for them. Iâ€™m not really political, but I am aware of whatâ€™s going on. How did young Michael Barratt, milkman, builder and upholsterer, turn into Shakinâ€™ Stevens? A friend of mine called Steven Vanderwalker used to call himself Shakinâ€™ Steven. I thought: â€œThatâ€™s something you wont forget.â€\\x9d So my band became Shakinâ€™ Stevens and the Sunsets. What was it like doing raw, raucous rockâ€™nâ€™roll in the era of prog rock, punk and disco? Wild. John Peel came to our gigs. Weâ€™d play places like the Hope and Anchor [in north London], turn up in the van, slide the gear down the chute, do the gig, all sweaty, then find a car park to sleep in the van. None of this X Factor nonsense. Your big career break came in the theatre, playing the young Elvis in the West End (4), didnâ€™t it? I was starving. The Sunsets had set. It was time for me to move on. I loved every minute of it. I just took my stage act into Elvis, standing on the back of the seats and stuff. In those days, Iâ€™d arrive at gigs, look at the girders and think â€œIâ€™ll be up there tonight.â€\\x9d It wasnâ€™t unknown for me to walk along the bar, with the microphone stuck down the sax playerâ€™s wotsit. How did you come across the song Marie Marie, which was previously released on a tiny indie label, performed by an underground band who played with the likes of Black Flag, X and Fear on the LA punk circuit? The Blasters! I was in America working. We had some time to kill, ended up at this guyâ€™s flat while he played records and that was one. I thought: â€œThatâ€™s a great song. Iâ€™ll have that.â€\\x9d The rest is history. And before long you were the biggest selling British singles artist of the 80s. (5) I was a 17-year overnight success really. I think I earned it. Is it a crazy existence when youâ€™re that big? There was that infamous incident when you attacked Richard Madeley on live TV, wasnâ€™t there? Iâ€™d been doing endless radio and TV stuff. Iâ€™d been there since early in the morning, all the interview questions were really badly researched and I just thought, â€œThis is ludicrousâ€\\x9d and leapt on him on the sofa. He was going: â€œOh my watch, oh my hair!â€\\x9d On the recording you can hear fellow guests Status Quo going â€œYouâ€™re mad, you are.â€\\x9d Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with being mad. I met Richard again years later and he said: â€œWhat a prat I was.â€\\x9d When the hits eventually dried up, you made some unlikely records: disco, funk covers and such. I was trying to find my way really. Itâ€™s healthy for artists to move on. I didnâ€™t have a manager that would come up with ideas, so I did stuff like [the Detroit Emeraldsâ€™] Feel the Need in Me and [the Supremesâ€™] Come See About Me. I wasnâ€™t really happy with a lot of them. The people who signed me at record companies kept leaving. It was like being a footballer when they change the manager. In 2002, you were banned for drink driving and had to attend the Gloucester drink and drug counselling service. Iâ€™d been working and staying in this hotel, which was just down the lane. Either the police were waiting or someone told on me. It was two or three minutesâ€™ drive, but the wrong thing to do. Silly. Did the police recognise you? Iâ€™m sure they did, but they treated me like anyone else. They didnâ€™t ask you to sing Green Door? Ha. I never thought of doing that, but I was out of it, so I wouldnâ€™t have remembered the words. Was your 2010 heart attack really caused by â€œstrenuous gardeningâ€\\x9d? Iâ€™d been picking up bags of stones. I knew something was wrong. I fell asleep and didnâ€™t wake up. Luckily my partner found me and called the ambulance. If Iâ€™d been alone Iâ€™d have been a goner. Youâ€™re the only person Iâ€™ve ever spoken to whoâ€™s had their body frozen. To slow my metabolism. I had an ice hat on, ice under my arms, wires everywhere. But here I am. And looking great. Did the brush with the reaper give you a new sense of urgency? Yeah and I realised youâ€™ve got to look after your body. Iâ€™ve been drunk like anyone else. I just woke up one morning and thought: â€œThatâ€™s it, no more drinking.â€\\x9d I just have a glass of wine. Or a couple of glasses of wine. What can people expect on your forthcoming tour (6)? Iâ€™d rather bang my head on the ceiling than do those rewind shows, reliving the 80s. I still do the hits â€“ not all of them â€“ but in a different way. Thereâ€™s a lot more to come out of me. I feel like Iâ€™m a skittle. If Iâ€™m knocked down, Iâ€™ll get up and try again. I donâ€™t want to ever stop. I still really enjoy singing. Now youâ€™re an Americana artist, will you get a check shirt and beard? I never dressed like a teddy boy, and I donâ€™t like shaving but youâ€™ve got to do it. I donâ€™t think a beard and moustache would suit me very much, do you? (1) Echoes of Our Times is released on 16 September. (2) Which spent three weeks at No 1 in 1981. (3) The myth is Bob Davie and Martin Mooreâ€™s 1956 song refers to Gateways, Londonâ€™s first lesbian club, which had a green door. Itâ€™s almost certably not true. (4) Elvis! had a two-year run from 1977 to 1979. (5) Shaky has notched up 33 Top 40 hits in the UK. (6) Shakinâ€™ Stevens tours next year.\",\n",
              "  'Football transfer rumours: Romelu Lukaku going back to Chelsea? What must Diego Costa think? Chelsea are fully within their rights to tell AtlÃ©tico Madrid to do one with their approaches, but now that story appears to have reached a dead end, the cantankerous 27-year-old Spain striker is finding out that Antonio Conte has an eye on several other attacking options. First up, Romelu Lukaku is a target â€“ but would the Belgian really want to come back to Stamford Bridge, and face a battle for a starting position when he is the undisputed first choice at Everton? That may just be a plan B if Chelseaâ€™s move for Ã\\x81lvaro Morata fails to come up trumps. Morata has only rejoined Real Madrid after they activated his buy-back clause at Juventus, but Chelsea have already made two bids and may go back for a third. Letâ€™s not forget he was chosen in Spainâ€™s Euro 2016 squad instead of Costa. Thatâ€™s before mentioning Michy Batshuayiâ€™s solid debut in Chelseaâ€™s friendly win over Wolfsberger last night. Conte is in no mood to sell Andreas Christensen to Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, though. The 20-year-old is halfway through a two season loan at the Bundesliga club, who have been sufficiently impressed to offer almost Â£15m. Thatâ€™s not enough in Chelseaâ€™s books. After a 1-0 humbling against former club Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola has decided he needs to bring craft to his Manchester City midfield and will table a bid for Real Madridâ€™s Toni Kroos. Reunification is in fashion. Guardiola is also reeling from the news that his first game will not be against The Big Sam , with Sunderland in talks with David Moyes about taking over at the Stadium of Light. Hull, worryingly, are not being linked with anybody, despite eight of the 14 senior players under contract being injured and just over three weeks to go before the season starts. At least Steve Bruce is staying, though. Oh Nacer, Nacer Chadli has caught the eye of Swansea, who may be willing to fork out Â£10m to purchase the Belgium midfielder from Tottenham. Daniel Levy would rather Â£15m, mind. Action is imminent at West Brom, where Saido Berahino might finally be sold 347 windows after a move from the Hawthorns was initially mooted and Jeffrey Schlupp could be on his way in to Tony Pulisâ€™ squad after an offer was made to Leicester. And how could a Rumour Mill end without a mention of Manchester United? What a summer it has been at Old Trafford. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Eric Bailly, possibly Paul Pogba and now â€“ perhaps the biggest one of all â€“ Joshua Bohui is set to join from Brentford. Actually, thatâ€™s maybe even a tad too facetious for this column. Bohui is a promising 17-year-old winger who may end up being rather good, and will go into the academy.',\n",
              "  'DNA-testing kit 23andme: patient-powered healthcare or just confusing? How do you fancy spitting into a tube and finding out about your genes? You can buy one online now and get details of your ancestry, carrier status of various inherited diseases, risk of common conditions and random wacky facts such as whether youâ€™re likely to develop male-pattern baldness. Not bad for Â£124.99 from Superdrug. The kit is called 23andme and its co-founder and chief executive is Anne Wojcicki. While 23andme has been able to offer the tests in the UK and Canada, it had run-ins with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over its concerns about the accuracy of data collected. In 2013 the FDA banned the company from selling tests directly to consumers. The company has since relaunched a scaled back version and is the first and only direct-to-consumer genetic test available to individuals in the US that includes reports that meet FDA standards. Its US tests give information on carrier status, ancestry, wellness and trait reports but donâ€™t include the information on drug response and genetic risk factors that are included in the UK test, according to the company. Consumer-powered healthcare? â€œDirect-to-consumer healthcare is coming,â€\\x9d said Wojcicki at Fortuneâ€™s Most Powerful Women Next Gen conference last month . â€œDo you have to go to your physician for everything? Do you have to go for a blood test? Do you have to go for all your genetic information?â€\\x9d The answer to these questions is clearly â€œnoâ€\\x9d. It was easier for me to go online and get a kit than to get an appointment with my local GP. I spat into the device, put the kit in the post and await my results with some curiosity, a pinch of scepticism and an unexpected degree of anxiety. 23andme doesnâ€™t test the whole genome. It identifies genetic markers known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or â€œsnipsâ€\\x9d. SNPs are positions along the DNA chain where genetic variations commonly occur. Fans of self-testing says itâ€™s interesting to find out about your ancestry, useful to know if youâ€™re at increased risk of certain conditions and reassuring to know if youâ€™re not. If the test points to risk, you can take preventive action, for example by losing weight if youâ€™re prone to diabetes. You may be more likely to take part in a national screening programme such as the NHS bowel cancer screening programme if the test shows an increased risk of bowel cancer. Erynn Gordon, director of clinical development at 23andme, says screening programmes that target specific communities (like sickle-cell anaemia among African-Caribbean people) may miss other individuals who are at risk. â€œThe narrow approach to screening doesnâ€™t take into account our diverse communities.â€\\x9d She also points to a (very small) study that suggests that people who receive unexpected information about carrier status donâ€™t suffer undue anxiety as well as research that concludes people understand the implications of testing very well. Limitations The test is controversial and the cons are important. Consultant genetics counsellor Christine Patch says she has several areas of concern about self-testing: people failing to understand the limitations of the test; what the data will be used for and who will have access to it; and the implications for cash-strapped health services in terms of inappropriate requests for follow-up testing. Once you have information about your genetic risk, for example, do you have to declare it to an insurance company? Do you have an ethical duty to tell other family members? Does the NHS have to pay for further testing? â€œYou may find youâ€™re at increased risk of Alzheimerâ€™s disease ... and thereâ€™s nothing [specific] you can do about it,â€\\x9d says Patch. Most common diseases, like asthma, high blood pressure and diabetes, are a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors. And some inherited conditions like being a carrier of cystic fibrosis, may result from many different abnormalities not detected by the kit. The kit may offer false reassurance, she says. There are already various free online tools to estimate your individual risk of getting a condition like osteoporosis, a heart attack or stroke, or diabetes. And people with a family history of serious conditions like Huntingtonâ€™s Chorea need expert genetic counselling to work out risk and reproductive options. Dr Katherine Leask, a medico-legal adviser with the Medical Defence Union, says doctors need to be aware of the challenges that increased use of kits like 23andme will pose. â€œGenomic medicine is going to become more mainstream and doctors need to know what tests are available. If someone needs genetic testing because of their family history ... then doctors need to consider whether tests need to be offered.â€\\x9d Chances are this will involve referral to a specialist centre that can offer counselling and specific testing if appropriate rather than telling them to buy a kit. The Department of Health is running a hugely ambitious programme through its company Genomics England. It aims to sequence 100,000 whole genomes from 70,000 people who have either common cancers or rare inherited diseases, together with their families. Their claims are notably more modest than the direct-to-consumer marketing. â€œDoing this [genome sequencing] may help medical teams provide better diagnosis or treatment. But it may not because not enough is known yet about the meaning of all the genomic data.â€\\x9d says communications manager Lisa Dinh. There are no plans to roll out genome testing on the NHS for the entire population, says Dinh. â€œHowever it is likely that our knowledge about the genome will expand in coming years, which should mean better and quicker diagnoses and treatments for more patients. We do not have an official view on 23andMe.â€\\x9d. Patch says: â€œIâ€™m not against the kits; if people want to spend their money on it, thatâ€™s fine. But personally, I wouldnâ€™t do the test. I do my best to stay healthy, and if I become unwell Iâ€™ll get help. But Iâ€™m not going to go looking for problems.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'How do I â€¦ avoid using Amazon? Amazon has announced its leap into the UKâ€™s fresh food market after a supply deal was agreed with Morrisons, the countryâ€™s fourth biggest supermarket. Britons spent Â£5.3bn on Amazon in 2014 and the online retail juggernaut was voted best customer service provider in January this year. Already renowned for its low prices, next-day delivery and online movie streaming, Amazonâ€™s natural next step seems to be grocery deliveries. However, while customers may be fond of the convenience and speed of Amazonâ€™s operations, it is a company that inspires more complicated feeling in its workers. Last year, a New York Times investigation revealed the extent of the pressure put on Amazonâ€™s employees. Grown men seen sobbing in the office, frequent layoffs creating a climate of fear, people with cancer being overworked â€¦ the list goes on, though Amazon later denied these claims. These allegations, as well as the knowledge that Amazon has put smaller stores, especially bookshops, out of business, give some people misgivings about the company. And that is before we get to the fact that Amazon, like Google and Starbucks, has had a somewhat fraught relationship with HMRC. In 2014, the company paid just Â£11.9m in UK taxes, though last May it agreed to pay corporation tax on UK sales. This has led a number of people to try to live a life free from Amazon. Ethical Consumer magazine decided to boycott it, denouncing â€œcheaper shopping at the expense of our public servicesâ€\\x9d after the tax avoidance row. writer Stuart Heritage said the revelation of the horrendous workplace culture at its headquarters was enough to push him to boycott, despite the â€œconvenience of buying stuff in my pants on a laptop on my sofaâ€\\x9d. For those who are worried by Amazonian overreach, here are a few ways to curb your dependence and get your goods elsewhere. Turn to other online shops Ebay celebrated 15 years of activity in the UK in 2014, when it sold 3bn items â€“ not all of them kitsch memorabilia. The website has made the fortune of many an entrepreneur, and the range of items sold would bewilder even the most savvy of online shoppers. If itâ€™s only a movie youâ€™re after, there are alternatives: Hulu and Netflix vie with Amazon Prime in the web-streaming space. And those who particularly object to Amazonâ€™s labour practices can feel especially good about signing up to Netflix, which offers its employees a year of paid maternity or paternity leave and regularly tops the list of best companies to work for. But because you canâ€™t have it all, the latest news seem to suggest that it too is sometimes not overly keen on paying corporation tax in Britain. Hive.co.uk proudly boasts that it is a â€œBritish, tax-paying company.â€\\x9d A network of 360 independent booksellers in the country, it will provide you with the latest books, audio and video you need. And to make your conscience even clearer, a percentage of every purchase goes back to local independent bookshops, helping them to survive in the scary era of all-online shopping. Alternatively, you could buy books while supporting your favourite news website by clicking here. Food-wise, Morrisons, Sainsburyâ€™s, Tesco, Asda and Waitrose already deliver, in exchange for a minimum spending and a small delivery fee. There are also a host of companies that offer food boxes delivered to your door, such as Abel & Cole, Hello Fresh and Gousto. Back to the high street According to the Office for National Statistics, food sellers have the lowest proportion of sales occurring online, at just 4%. Most of us still leave the house to go food shopping, be it at a big supermarket branch or at the corner shop. As well as being healthier â€“ a wander through Asda isnâ€™t exactly a spin class but does get the heart rate up much higher than sitting and clicking on the couch â€“ a recent study by investment firm Charles Stanley showed that you are more likely to make bad decisions when shopping online shopping. The almost infinite range of products makes it harder to find the best deals, and the lack of assistance means that you might be missing some vital information â€“ or simply buying the wrong product. And you could be saving jobs too. As online shopping has exploded in the past few years, high-street retailers have struggled to adapt to the changing needs of customers. Since the 2008 financial crash, Woolworths and Zavvi, among others, have closed down. Perhaps significantly, both these brands offered products that can now be ordered in one click from a plethora of online competitors. On Monday, the British Retail Consortium announced that 900,000 industry jobs were at risk in the next 10 years, on the same day Amazon announced its partnership with Morrisons. Resist the urge to splurge While we received the encouraging news this week that we are consuming far less than we were 10 years ago â€“ with the average person in the UK using 10 tonnes of material in 2013, down from 15 tonnes in 2001 â€“ we still use and buy too much. According to the National Employment Savings Trust, 85% of Britons spend money on stuff they seldom or never use. Taken as a whole, that is Â£6.2bn we could save every year. And with the nationâ€™s top impulse buy being bananas, Amazonâ€™s forthcoming delivery of fresh food could be bad news for our wallets. Itâ€™s worth resisting the allure of unnecessary online purchases, one banana at a time. This article was amended on 4 March 2016 to make it clear that Amazon later denied allegations of difficult working conditions at its headquarters.',\n",
              "  'Why PokÃ©mon Go really is a national health service If parenting is one long process of discovering that it doesnâ€™t really happen like they say in the books, then school holidays are proof positive that Swallows and Amazons was fiction. Every July starts, at least in this house, with starry-eyed delusions about a summer spent messing about on rivers, climbing trees and having wholesome adventures. Or failing that, perhaps a summer of cheery educational play as per the more optimistic newspaper supplements, where the kids thrill to your kitchen science experiments and treasure hunts round National Trust properties. And every July ends with the realisation that actually itâ€™s not going to be like that. We will not spend summer picnicking and playing beach cricket, because it is going to rain all August. We wonâ€™t be that family in the museum whose kids just beg to hear more about the ancient Egyptians, because we will be that family whose kid rolls its eyes sarcastically at the very idea of filling in the museumâ€™s lovely quiz. There will be afternoons where nobody looks up from Minecraft. And yet a tiny flicker of hope remains, for this is the summer of the PokÃ©mon Go app. The craze for this remarkably silly mobile phone game â€“ which involves chasing cartoony little virtual monsters through the surrounding real world, as they pop into shot on your phoneâ€™s camera â€“ is currently outstripped only by the craze for stories about stupid things people do while playing it. A holocaust museum in Washington was forced to remind visitors that itâ€™s crassly inappropriate to catch imaginary gonks on your phone while wandering round a memorial to victims of genocide. Tragically, a teenager in Guatemala was shot while playing the game â€“ although whether the game had anything to do with the death remains unclear. There are reports of drivers crashing cars while surreptitiously playing on their phones; and a woman rescued by emergency services after getting stuck up a tree while chasing PokÃ©mon. Yet what makes PokÃ©mon Go irresistible is that itâ€™s basically a good old-fashioned treasure hunt crossed with a fairytale, adding up to that parenting holy grail: an excuse to go out in the fresh air and move. Friends with boys in the awkward tweens â€“ too old and self-conscious for running round the garden, too young to hunker moodily in bedrooms â€“ report a sudden revival of â€œplaying outâ€\\x9d in the park under the guise of PokÃ©mon hunting. Itâ€™s as if the app gives them an excuse to be kids again. And those dry police reports about increased â€œfoot trafficâ€\\x9d in cities thanks to overgrown kidults playing the game? Thatâ€™s code for what public health campaigns have struggled for decades to achieve, namely getting people out of the house and walking. If I were the NHS, Iâ€™d be pleading with Nintendo to cluster PokÃ©mon characters along hiking routes and bike trails, up mountains and in woods. For every nine players who move through, not lifting their eyes off the phone, there will be one who looks up and sees something they might not otherwise have. Yet all new technology must seemingly pass through three stages before we can reach such acceptance, and PokÃ©mon Go is no exception; first comes the fear that itâ€™s somehow going to kill us (tick); second, the inevitable articles about how single women in New York are using it to meet men (tick); and finally a moral panic over what it supposedly reveals about human nature that actually we already knew (getting there). Yes, people have done dumb and risky things while playing PokÃ©mon Go. But replace the words â€œplaying PokÃ©mon Goâ€\\x9d with almost any activity and that sentence remains true. Why, itâ€™s almost as if the fault lies with people, not with the tools we ingeniously devise to satisfy that most endearingly human of instincts: play. Talk of British creative industries, and people think of theatre, music or film. But gaming is a multibillion-pound player now, the point where arts meets tech, and as embedded in British culture as telly, without being quite so generously acknowledged. Having never got the bug myself, the sight of anyone hunched over a screen will never make my heart sing, but watching my son and his friends play dispels the fear that thereâ€™s something inherently antisocial about it. They donâ€™t want to play alone, or with faceless strangers over the internet. What they crave is to be all in the same room, hooking up their individual devices to one Wi-Fi, building a sprawling collective Minecraft empire in which they share virtual adventures while chatting away in real life. Theyâ€™re deep in an imaginary world, just as I was as a little girl playing shops, but itâ€™s interleaved with the physical world around them, and they move quite naturally between the two. No wonder, then, that this summerâ€™s hit isnâ€™t some overhyped virtual reality game but an augmented reality one that takes game elements and overlays them on our shared real world. As all games do, it has the potential to get messy. Thereâ€™s always someone who gets carried away, tips the Monopoly board over and ruins it for everyone. But humans will always want to play, and thereâ€™s something oddly moving about the lengths to which we will go to invent new games for each other. How touching that, after all this time, we still so badly want to play together.',\n",
              "  'FA Cup must remain footballâ€™s hollow crown to maintain its magic Gary Linekerâ€™s documentary on Leicester Cityâ€™s title success the other night had an intentionally dreamlike quality. Even now, at a distance of just a few days from the end of a remarkable Premier League season, it is still tempting to wonder whether it all really happened. It did, of course, we can be sure of that. Otherwise Arsenal would now be champions, Tottenham kicking themselves even more than usual and Manchester United inviting Louis van Gaal to spend a bit more money in preparation for next seasonâ€™s Champions League. There has been some debate in these pages over the last few days over whether United have improved this season, stood still or gone backwards. My conclusion was that they are ever so slowly getting better, based on the joint best defence in the division and some exciting discoveries up front in Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford. The league table suggests otherwise, and many were quick to point out that finishing fourth last season and fifth this time is a step back, not forward, though that can largely be explained by the Leicester effect. Take Leicester out of the equation, pretend for a moment that they did not confound bookies and pundits alike by coming from nowhere to finish on top, and United are pretty much where they were last season apart from having an FA Cup final to look forward to and a couple of new strikers to utilise. If some people had their way, the winners of Saturdayâ€™s showpiece at Wembley would be granted a place in next seasonâ€™s Champions League as a reward. It has been suggested over and over again that the way to halt the decline of the FA Cup would be to make it a prize worth winning, and it is certainly true that were the competition to provide a route to the Champions League for the winners, in the way that the Europa League now does, then everyone would start taking it seriously again. Especially the big teams, or more specifically the big teams who might just finish fifth or sixth in the Premier League. Teams such as Manchester United in fact, who on several occasions in the past have been guilty of making the FA Cup the lowest of their priorities. Such a change, which would require Uefa to alter its rules, would probably fix the FA Cup, though it might not be the best idea in the long run for English success in the Champions League. Suppose Crystal Palace win on Saturday, for a start. Bearing in mind that the Premier Leagueâ€™s normal quota of four Champions League places is based on a coefficient that tracks English clubsâ€™ record in Europe over the years, would it really be a good plan to send along a club that finished in 15th place and only managed a couple of league wins since the turn of the year? FA Cup winners in recent seasons have included Wigan and Portsmouth, while Aston Villa, Hull and Cardiff have appeared in finals in the last 10 years. Would it be entirely fair to send clubs like that into Europeâ€™s premier competition, based on stringing four or five results together in the Cup, when the side that finish in fourth after the 38 games of the Premier Leagueâ€™s arduous season would then have to be content with a Europa League spot? Even Van Gaal thinks not, or at least he did a few weeks ago when the possibility was put to him. He might be more tempted to grab at the lifeline now, but last month he was of the opinion that a side with a lucky cup run should not win a bigger prize than those teams who have shown the most consistency over the course of a whole season. Though Leicester have given everyone pause for thought over what might be achieved by so-called lesser clubs, the fact they won the title by a clear 10 points is a sure indication of quality, consistency and durability. The Foxes have earned their shot at the big time next season and we are all fascinated to see how it will go. We might be equally fascinated were it to be Palace, Wigan or Villa lining up against Bayern Munich or Barcelona, though not for the same reasons. So, much as one would like to see the FA Cup receive a life-saving injection of importance, linking it to Champions League qualification seems fraught with risk. Except that the issue of small clubs taking the place of bigger clubs in Europe would possibly not arise so often once the big clubs got their act together and realised the FA Cup could be their golden ticket. Upsets would become much less frequent if everybody suddenly began to regard FA Cup progress as vital, and stopped switching goalkeepers, resting players or trying out a few youngsters. Over time the Cup would just become a top-four event again, as it was in the 11 years from 1996 to 2007, when everyone complained the romance had died. Funny thing though, romance. Everyone said it was back when Portsmouth broke the mould in 2008, and again when Wigan beat Manchester City in 2013, yet for both those clubs Wembley glory prefaced a sharp downturn in fortunes. What would probably happen, with Champions League qualification as a prize, is that lucky cup runs â€“ the kind of thing that took Palace to Wembley this time â€“ would become a thing of the past. Van Gaalâ€™s reservations would become less relevant; if everyone was trying their best and putting out their strongest teams then winning the six games (for leading clubs) necessary to lift the trophy would be a feat deserving of reward. But no more so than holding on for fourth place in the table. Hoping to use the lure of the Champions League to return the glamour to the FA Cup would not restore the old magic, it would just turn the competition into an annexe of the Premier League. It is regrettable that Saturdayâ€™s Wembley winners will end up with little more than a hollow crown, but could anyone seriously argue that either side deserves to be in the Champions League next season?',\n",
              "  'May the fourth be with you: United and City in final-day battle of Manchester The last day of the Premier League season confirms a power shift has finally taken place. The Midlands is now the centre of attention, something not many observers imagined they would live to see, with Tottenham and Arsenal well represented for a change as north London fills the next two automatic Champions League qualification slots. The two Manchester clubs, like bald men fighting over a comb, are now reduced to a tussle over who finishes in fourth place, the one with the extra qualifying round. Considering the financial resources at their disposal this is undeniable underachievement. Manuel Pellegrini can spout all the statistics he likes, just as Louis van Gaal can blame injuries and bad luck, but the two clubs have never been wealthier yet this season is going to be the first in Premier League history without either of them in the top three. City began to feature at the awards end of the table around five seasons ago, the proud Mancunian record is otherwise entirely down to United and the Sir Alex Ferguson years. Yet before United dominated the football landscape Liverpool did, and one has to go back 35 years, to the last time a Midlands team was crowned champions, to find a top three with no representation from the north-west. Aston Villaâ€™s title-winning season in 1981 was something of a one-off too, even more than it must seem from the perspective of a side just relegated to the Championship. The previous occasion when north-west clubs were absent from the podium was 1961, when Sheffield Wednesday and Wolves finished second and third in Tottenhamâ€™s Double-winning season. With that historical context in mind, finishing in fourth should not really count for anything at all. If second is nowhere, as Bill Shankly always used to maintain, fourth might as well be in a different division. The Champions League has altered how we view these things: fourth place is now considered more important than winning one of the cups, but the Champions League is supposed to be an old palsâ€™ act, a self-perpetuating, self-aggrandising elite whereby the same big, rich clubs just get bigger and richer and hoover up everyone elseâ€™s best players so that smaller clubs can do little more than stand on the pavement outside and look in through the window. That is why everyone enjoyed Leicesterâ€™s gatecrashing act so much. City very much want to be among the grandees of Europe; United used to be comfortable in that company until losing their way in the later stages of Fergusonâ€™s reign, though by definition you cannot be a bona fide Champions League contender if you are still scrabbling around for qualification on the final day of the season. Even if City did reach the semi-final, the manner in which they ultimately slid out of view did nothing to suggest regular reachers of the last four will be hoping to avoid them next season. That is what Pep Guardiola is about to take over, regardless of whether City stay in fourth place. There will be much tittering from the red half of Manchester if their new luxury coach arrives to supervise a Europa League campaign, though apart from the initial indignity there is no real reason why City could not survive a season out of the Champions League. Most teams are in it for the money; City already have plenty of that. City have hired Guardiola to take them to the next level in Europe; fair enough, but does he have to do it in his first season? On the evidence of the domestic season now concluding Guardiola will have enough of a rebuilding job on his hands just turning City back into the strongest team in England. They have never managed to look really convincing in Europe and though Guardiola might be exactly the man to effect that transformation it is a big ask to expect him to do it straight away. United do not really need the Champions League either. They have just announced record profits for the latest financial quarter, their money-making machine could survive a short holiday from the hot spots and hot shots of Europe. Van Gaalâ€™s job is supposed to be hanging on a fourth-place finish, but he managed that last season and United found themselves out of the Champions League before Christmas. Were he to take advantage of any City slip-up at Swansea and sneak into fourth with a United win against Bournemouth on Sunday afternoon he would probably be safe for another season, especially if he can bring home the FA Cup next Saturday, though it is a moot question whether that would be a cause for celebration in and around Old Trafford. What most people think United should do at this point is make a clear statement about who will be in charge next season, and possibly beyond. A team that could have been dumped out of the Europa League by Midtjylland had they not promoted Marcus Rashford in the nick of time really has no business waiting around to see if Champions League qualification can help them arrive at a decision. United appear to be adhering to the traditional view, as expressed by Pellegrini in his final press conference in Manchester. â€œFor a big team, if you donâ€™t qualify for the Champions League it is a disaster,â€\\x9d he said. But Pellegrini went on to say something else. â€œI donâ€™t think it matters for one year â€“ as happened to United in 2014 and Chelsea this season â€“ but it is not the best thing for it to happen over a number of years.â€\\x9d Quite. With the money United offer players, and the prospect of working under Guardiola at City, it is probably not even true that transfer targets would turn their noses up because of non-Champions League status. What is true is that the very best players, Renato Sanches being a case in point, will always want to join the best clubs. Doubtless to Guardiolaâ€™s chagrin, Bayern Munich have reached only Champions League semi-finals in his three years in Germany, though they do boast three successive league titles. That is consistency of a sort and even if the German model is not to be preferred to the unpredictability of the Premier League it starts at home. The plain, unvarnished truth is that the pride of Manchester, whichever side finishes highest, has some catching up to do on the domestic front before entertaining dreams of conquering Europe.',\n",
              "  'Director of Cannes civil rights drama Loving: â€˜Society can take longer than the law to get it rightâ€™ There are two marriages behind Loving, a new historical biopic which on Monday threw its hat into the race for this yearâ€™s Palme dâ€™Or at Cannes. The first is that which the film shows: between Mildred and Richard Loving, whose interracial union was deemed unlawful in their home state in 1958. The couple were banned from Virginia for 25 years, moving with their children to Washington DC. Almost a decade later, their case reached the supreme court; the subsequent victory overturned miscegenation laws. The second is that of director Jeff Nichols and his wife, Missy. Weighing up whether or not to take on the project, he emailed her the trailer for an HBO documentary about the Lovings, which had moved him to tears. As Nichols recalled at a press conference in Cannes, she wrote back to say: â€œListen, I really love you, but if you donâ€™t make this film, Iâ€™m going to divorce you.â€\\x9d Duly motivated, Nichols first started working on the screenplay in 2013, as the supreme court began ruling on the same-sex marriage ban in the US; some of the constitutional changes were informed by by Loving v Virginia in 1967. Nichols hoped the film might be released in time to influence the debate; happily, this wasnâ€™t required, and same-sex marriage was ratified in 2015. But the director cautioned against the presumption such rulings lay to rest centuries-old prejudice that has been vindicated by legislation. â€œSoon you get religious liberty laws added and other things, and you realise the supreme court can only do so much. The law sometimes gets it right, but it takes a long time for society to get it right. Thatâ€™s always been surprising to me. People are afraid of certain things and they feel itâ€™s necessary to legislate that fear.â€\\x9d Both the filmâ€™s stars reiterated their surprise at learning that the state of Alabama only amended their constitution to allow mixed-race marriage as late as 2000; both also related the Lovingsâ€™ case to contemporary struggles. Ruth Negga said sheâ€™d been â€œvery proudâ€\\x9d that her home country, Ireland, last year leant â€œoverwhelming supportâ€\\x9d for gay marriage in a referendum. â€œHaving a very, very Catholic history [it shows] itâ€™s possible to evolve, having discussions about equality.â€\\x9d â€œWhat happens between two individuals is sort of nobody elseâ€™s business,â€\\x9d said the Australian actor Joel Egerton. â€œIf people are doing things out of the spirit of kindness or goodness, if theyâ€™re not damaging or affecting other people negatively, then whatâ€™s wrong with the bond between two people â€“ whatever they look like, whatever gender they are?â€\\x9d In Australia, although same-sex unions are recognised, all attempts to legalise same-sex marriage have so far been unsuccessful. Egerton said he hoped the film would help illuminate peopleâ€™s thinking about the damage that can be inflicted by their own judgements. â€œItâ€™s quite astounding, the sort of latent, under-the-surface racism and negative opinion [in Australia]. To me, thatâ€™s something that we really need to talk about. Let people sit and quietly watch an example of two people who really affected by the opinions of others.â€\\x9d The film is due for release in the autumn, giving it a prime position ahead of awards season, and while Nichols, Egerton and Negga were modest about its prospects, the former called it â€œone of the most pure love stories in American historyâ€\\x9d while the latter hailed it as â€œone of the most important films in historyâ€\\x9d. Yet unlike, say, Ava Duverneyâ€™s Martin Luther King biopic, Selma, Loving is a consciously understated film, which focuses on the domestic fallout rather than the courtroom and soapbox fireworks. This was the intention, said the director, who described it as â€œthe quiet film of the yearâ€\\x9d. â€œWhen we talk about politics and social issues such as race and racial equality we tend to join our platform of thinking â€“ conservative, liberal; you go to your corners and spar, based on these political ideas. I think what people forget when theyâ€™re so heated in their debates is the people at the centre.â€\\x9d Egerton agreed, and said he hoped the filmâ€™s lack of flashy spectacle and impassioned speeches wouldnâ€™t hobble its odds. â€œI suspect sometimes things go unnoticed when they donâ€™t involve bloodshed or massive acts of violence. Thereâ€™s something so gentle about this, and yet, at the same time, thereâ€™s such a hidden violence to the oppression of situations like this, where people are put into exile or forced into making choices that are inhuman.â€\\x9d',\n",

JJ Abramsâ€™ sequel has now made $740.3m at the US and Canadian box office, putting it in second place on the chart of highest-grossing films in North America, behind Avatarâ€™s $760.8m from 2009/2010. Disneyâ€™s film is expected to take the No 1 spot by midweek. The third-highest weekend haul ever in the US means that The Force Awakens could challenge Avatarâ€™s $2.78bn all-time global box office record. The latest instalment of Star Wars opens in China, the worldâ€™s second-largest box office, on 9 January amid huge expectations. Elsewhere at the US box office, it was a good weekend for Oscar contenders. Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s The Hateful Eight climbed to No 3 after a successful limited release on Christmas Day in the 70mm screening format. The blood-spattered western took $16.2m on its wide-release debut. It is considerably less than the opening weekend results of Tarantinoâ€™s two most recent films, Inglourious Basterds ($38m) and Django Unchained ($30.1m). Expectations for The Hateful Eight, however, have been dampened by the ongoing success of The Force Awakens. Tarantinoâ€™s new movie has made $29.6m so far.

              "  \"Andrea Arnold: I find my adaptation of Wuthering Heights 'hard to look at' Oscar-winning British director Andrea Arnold has said that she finds her acclaimed 2011 adaptation of Wuthering Heights a difficult film to enjoy. The film-maker, who won the Academy award for best live-action short in 2005 for Wasp, spoke about Wuthering Heights during a discussion at this yearâ€™s Tribeca film festival. â€œPeople keep saying one day I will come to like it,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIt was a difficult experience making it, for various reasons. I find it hard to look at it.â€\\x9d Arnold, who has also directed acclaimed dramas Red Road and Fish Tank, claims that her â€œpure and beautifulâ€\\x9d vision of the novel was not what ultimately made it to the screen. She described â€œa misty moor on a day when the earth and sky are merging, and thereâ€™s a big animal climbing inside of the moor. But you went in and saw that it was a man, carrying rabbits on his back.â€\\x9d But, she said, â€œWhen we got to film it, we had half an hour to get it before the day was over. It was bright sunshine and blue sky, and we had about three rabbits.â€\\x9d Arnold was unhappy but still used the shot. â€œWhat can you do at that point?â€\\x9d she said. â€œYou canâ€™t because youâ€™re working with a whole team of people and thereâ€™s money.â€\\x9d She also added that it was a tough period for her off-screen as well. â€œIt was a very difficult time for me, that film,â€\\x9d she said. â€œI was in a dark place. When I think about how it was, itâ€™s associated with some personal stuff.â€\\x9d Her take on Wuthering Heights was met with mostly positive reviews on release, with the â€™s Peter Bradshaw calling it â€œexhilaratingâ€\\x9d. The director also spoke about her new film American Honey, her first to be shot in the US. The drama, which stars Shia LaBeouf as part of a group of travelling magazine salespeople, will premiere in competition at this yearâ€™s Cannes film festival. â€œI really do think I pushed it,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIt was very tough, there were scenes when I had loads of non-actors and we were running out of time, and I thought, â€˜I really donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to get this done.â€™â€\\x9d She was also surprised at what she discovered while filming in the US. â€œSome of the poverty in some of the places really shocked me,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIt seemed more intense than Britain. There was a town I went through in the south â€“ I did a lot of driving in the south, I loved the south â€“ and I was quite upset by what I saw: closed factories and shops, huge poverty. I guess I didnâ€™t know that, to the degree that I saw it. And drugs ... loads of drugs.â€\\x9d\",\n",

But it was his brother, PJ, tweeting the final hours of the tournament from his home in Birmingham, who stole the spotlight. PJ Willett, who describes himself as â€œAuthor. Teacher. Inexperienced Fatherâ€\\x9d on his Twitter profile, swore, drank and joked his way through the tense close to the four-day contest that saw his brother become only the second Englishman to wear the famous green jacket. His tweets included digs at Willettâ€™s rival, Jordan Spieth, as well untempered emotion as his brother edged closer to the win. At times, his tweets veered into the profane. But they also demonstrated his unrivalled joy at his brotherâ€™s outstanding performance. And were often totally hilarious. When it became clear that his younger brother had beaten Spieth to take the US Masters title he was overcome. His outpouring won him fans from across the golfing world, and beyond. Willettâ€™s tweets were so popular that he started trending in the UK. And he seemed rather pleased with his handiwork. At the same time, sporting greats were paying tribute to Willettâ€™s victory, including former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan, who shares his hometown, Sheffield, with Willett.

              "  'Readers recommend playlist: your songs about religion Below is this weekâ€™s playlist â€“ the theme and tunes picked by a reader from the comments below in last weekâ€™s callout. Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the format of the weekly Readers recommend series at the end of the piece. According to former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, â€œreason has been a part of organised religion ever since two nudists took dietary advice from a talking snakeâ€\\x9d. You may or may not agree with this, but itâ€™s certainly true religion has inspired artists and musicians for centuries, and â€“ trying, perhaps, to disprove the old maxim that â€œthe Devil has the best tunesâ€\\x9d â€“ below is a playlist of my favourites from your suggestions this week. Firstly, one that some listeners might wish to fast forward through is Decree 10.05 by Church Universal and Triumphant, Inc. feat Elizabeth Clare Prophet. Itâ€™s 20-plus minutes of invocation about Heaven knows what. An extraordinary track, if a little disturbing. More traditional is Tennessee Ernie Fordâ€™s call for a dose of That Old Time Religion, so, ever ready to oblige, we follow on with some old-time religion in the shape of Wardrunaâ€™s Rotlaust Tre Fell, a piece of Scandinavian folk music that draws upon Norse mythology for inspiration. Iron Maiden, restrained as ever, remind us that the Number of the Beast is 666. There are complex explanations as to why this particular number was chosen as beastly, but personally I think it was selected because it looks nice ... People can get â€œreligiousâ€\\x9d about all sorts of things. For OPM itâ€™s skateboarding, leading to Heaven Is a Halfpipe. Each to their own and all that. Jello Biafraâ€™s Lard offer us some Hellfudge, next. I think I had some of that once â€“ it was kind of chewy ... And then we have hippy favourites Quintessence, who hedge their bets, perhaps wisely, with Jesus Buddha Moses Gauranga. Sensible chaps. God makes many things â€“ all things, in fact, according to some â€“ so itâ€™s no surprise that he made Philou Louzolo funky. His Phunky Coogi is a delightful piece of praise in musical form. Withered Hand (Scottish indie rock musician Dan Wilson) earns his place thanks to the wonderful line â€œKnocking on Kevinâ€™s doorâ€\\x9d in Religious Songs, I am a sucker for a good (or bad?) pun. Bringing up the rear this week, it has to be Kana Uemura with Toilet no Kamisama (â€œGod of Toiletâ€\\x9d). Itâ€™s a song about both â€œgodâ€\\x9d and toilets and yet so much more (for more on the lyrics see a translation provided in the comments by HoshinoSakura). There really is a lesson in â€œZenâ€\\x9d here: how the mundane daily task can, if carried out in the right spirit, bring us closer to the divine. Itâ€™s a lovely, toilety, tune too ...

              "  'Marillion â€“ 10 of the best 1. Forgotten Sons Marillion were still defining their sound when they recorded their first album, 1983â€™s Script for a Jesterâ€™s Tear. While theyâ€™d already got crude pastiches of Supperâ€™s Ready out of their system, the dramatic album closer still displays strong echoes of Genesisâ€™s The Knife and Pink Floydâ€™s Comfortably Numb. The tale of a young soldier caught up in the Troubles in Northern Ireland remains an intense and moving piece that transcends its rather obvious influences. In archetypal neo-progressive fashion, it builds through multiple sections, with a Psalm 23/Lordsâ€™ Prayer spoken-word part backed by a staccato riff stolen from Gustav Holstâ€™s Mars, the Bringer of War, and a powerful closing section demonstrating Fishâ€™s growing powers as a lyricist. A high water mark of early 80s neo-prog, itâ€™s a song thatâ€™s far more than the sum of its parts. 2. Incubus Marillionâ€™s second album, Fugazi, saw them leaving behind the notion that they were merely a pastiche of Gabriel-era Genesis, with a dense, layered sound that was far more their own. Driven by a propulsive riff, Incubus is a highlight, a song about revenge porn written three decades before it became a regular news item. While the lyrics are perhaps a little overblown, Fishâ€™s half-sung, half-ranted vocal gets disturbingly into the role of the jealous ex-lover of a celebrity. It still features regularly in Fishâ€™s live sets as a solo artist. 3. Warm Wet Circles/That Time of the Night Marillion hit the big time with the intense and personal-concept album Misplaced Childhood, which spawned their big hit single, Kayleigh. When it came to the follow-up, Clutching at Straws, they took a sharp left turn. Gone were the sprawling, serpentine song structures and opaque, overcooked lyrics, in favour of a more focused songwriting approach that would set the template for Fishâ€™s later solo career. I know treating these two as one song is cheating a bit, but they work as one continuous piece, with Steve Rotheryâ€™s sublime solo forming the bridge between. When performed live, either by Fish or by the current incarnation of Marillion, theyâ€™re almost always played together. 4. Seasons End Just when Marillion seemed poised to conquer the world, the unthinkable happened. Burned out by constant touring without downtime and with divisions over musical direction beginning to surface, Fish left the band. Rather than trying to find a soundalike, they recruited the relatively unknown Steve Hogarth and used his very different vocal approach as an opportunity to reinvent themselves. Seasons End was the result. The title track is both soaring and anthemic, yet it is one of the saddest in their songbook. It is one of those songs that never fails to bring a lump to the throat. A perfect marriage of Hogarthâ€™s vocals and Rotheryâ€™s lyrical lead guitar. 5. The Great Escape After the singles from 1991â€™s pop-oriented Holidays in Eden failed to make the charts, the band launched a follow-up in 1994 with Brave, a dark and intense concept album with no obvious single, which remains a firm fan-favourite. Inspired by a news report of a girl with amnesia found wandering on the Severn Bridge, the narrative imagines a life story that might have bought someone to that place. The emotional climax of the album is the penultimate song, with musical motifs repeated from earlier in the album. The point when it changes gears is one of those moments. When they played the album in full at the 2013 fan convention, The Great Escape prompted a five-minute standing ovation. 6. Out of This World Marillion have a thing about death and water. Itâ€™s a recurring theme that goes right back to Chelsea Monday, from their debut. Out of This World comes from the album Afraid of Sunlight, whose songs reflect the flipside of fame. It tells the story of Donald Campbellâ€™s fatal attempt at the world water speed record in Bluebird in 1967, and the song itself was to inspire the recovery of the wreck of Bluebird from the depths of Coniston Water. This oneâ€™s a showcase for Steve Hogarthâ€™s vocals, and aside from Steve Rotheryâ€™s magnificent solo the song owes far more to Talk Talk than it does to Pink Floyd or Genesis. 7. Man of a Thousand Faces While latter-day Marillion are known for their atmospheric epics, sometimes they do write straightforward pop songs, and this one, from 1997â€™s This Strange Engine is one of their best, a semi-acoustic song with 12-string guitar and a delightful piano solo from Mark Kelly. By this point in their career theyâ€™d been dropped by EMI, and though Man of a Thousand Faces was released as a single, it got no radio airplay and didnâ€™t chart. 8. This Is the 21st Century Marillion go trip-hop. The 2001 album Anoraknophobia comes from the period when Marillion were experimenting with many different musical ideas and directions in an attempt to avoid repeating their own past, and drew comparisons with the more contemporary sounds of Radiohead and Massive Attack. The album was also hugely significant for the wider music business as the first successfully crowdfunded record, something for which Marillion donâ€™t always get the credit they deserve. This lengthy number was a high spot of the album, with a lyric serving a powerful rebuttal to the reductionist worldview of Richard Dawkins, who allowed no space for the spiritual. 9. Neverland The late 90s and early years of the new century saw a tension between the more contemporary side of their music and the classic Marillion sound centred on Steve Rotheryâ€™s distinctive, overdriven guitar. The sprawling double album version of 2004â€™s Marbles kept a foot in both camps, balancing lighter reflective songs with the 18-minute epic Ocean Cloud. The album comes to close with the anthemic Neverland, which begins as plaintive piano ballad and ends in a glorious wall of sound, monstrous waves of molten guitar as Steve Rothery duels with Steve Hogarth using his voice as a lead instrument. Itâ€™s been a live favourite ever since, with good reason. 10. The New Kings Most bands who have been around for almost four decades have long since burned out creatively, and if they still tour theyâ€™ve largely turned into their own tribute acts. Itâ€™s possible that the change of singer just at the point where they reached their creative peak is the secret to their longevity, but whatever the reason, Marillion still have something to say. From the elegiac opening chords onwards, the five-part epic that closes their 16th album, Fear, demonstrates this in spades, a lament for a world screwed over by corrupt self-serving elites. â€œDo you remember a country that cared for you? / A national anthem you could sing without feeling used or ashamed? / Now weâ€™re living for the new kingsâ€\\x9d, sings Hogarth as the musical twists and turns show all the strengths of Marillionâ€™s music from the 21st century.',\n",
              "  \"Hillary Clinton retains edge over Donald Trump in election's final sprint Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are sprinting towards the finish line of the most bitter, divisive and fear-tainted US presidential election of modern times, with polls showing Clinton has the edge. Seeking to become the first female president, the Democrat will end her campaign with a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina at midnight on Monday. Republican candidate Trump will close his at 11pm that night with an event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a state where he is hoping to pull off a huge surprise. Around a third of ballots â€“ at least 41m across 48 states â€“ have been cast in early voting, according to the Associated Press, and the election still appears to be Clintonâ€™s to lose. On Sunday, she led Trump 48%-43% in a Washington Post/ABC tracking poll, 44%-40% in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll and 45%-42% in a Politico/Morning Consult poll. Clinton received a boost on Sunday afternoon, with the release of a letter to Congress from FBI director James Comey that said the bureau had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton in its review of emails discovered during an investigation into charges against Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of key aide Huma Abedin. The FBI review related to Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while secretary of state, an issue over which the bureau had previously decided not to recommend an indictment. Nonetheless, data suggest Clinton is not as strongly placed in electoral college projections as Barack Obama was at the same stage in 2012. Clinton is not â€œin a terribly safe positionâ€\\x9d, leading pollster Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight told ABCâ€™s This Week on Sunday. â€œThe electoral map is actually less solid for Clinton than it was for Obama four years ago.â€\\x9d The two candidates have fought an ugly battle to become the 45th president, dogged by controversies ranging from FBI investigation into Clintonâ€™s email use to sexual assault allegations against Trump. Clinton would be the first spouse of a president to reach the White House. Trump, at 70, would be the oldest person to assume the office. As both candidates and their surrogates set out on a whirlwind final 48 hours on the trail, the wild card nature of Trumpâ€™s candidacy made the map harder to read than usual. Among 10 rallies planned over the last two days were stops in Minnesota, which has not supported a Republican presidential nominee since 1972, and Michigan, which has not gone to the GOP since 1988. Clinton, however, lost both states to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. Van Jones, a former adviser to Obama, told CNNâ€™s State of the Union: â€œBeds are damp. There is a crack in the blue wall and it has to do with trade. This is the ghost of Bernie Sanders.â€\\x9d The Trump campaign claimed â€œan enormous surge in momentum and enthusiasmâ€\\x9d in recent days, citing Minnesota, where the campaign said that in less than 24 hours it had 18,000 RSVPs for a event that could hold 5,000 people. It now sees â€œat least six different pathsâ€\\x9d to victory, aides said. Dave Bossie, deputy campaign manager, told reporters: â€œWe have expanded the map. We are on offence. We are going to places no one thought we would. Itâ€™s an incredibly exciting time for our campaign. Hillary Clinton is on defence and her map is shrinking. We feel we are peaking at the right time as a campaign.â€\\x9d Clinton has led every poll in Michigan but she, Obama and Bill Clinton were all due to appear there before the vote. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said such major political figures were now playing â€œfollow your leaderâ€\\x9d in traditional Democratic states. â€œWe feel very good about the fact that weâ€™re actually setting the landscape here and theyâ€™re chasing us around in these blue states,â€\\x9d she said. â€œWe have seen our prospects improving in Michigan for quite a while now internally and we do see that now reflected in some of the public polling. We also like what we hear on the ground in Michigan ... and we trust the savviness and brilliance of the Clinton campaign. â€œIf they thought Michigan was in the bag, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama would not be returning there today or tomorrow.â€\\x9d Democrats insisted that was because there is no early voting in the state, so they want to fire up the base. Clinton campaign chair John Podesta told NBCâ€™s Meet the Press: â€œIf we hold on to Nevada, if we hold on to Michigan, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president of America. â€œMost people vote on election day in Michigan, so our schedule has been oriented toward being in the early vote states in the earlier period of time. We feel like weâ€™ve got a lead in Michigan. We want to hold on to it, and we think we can do that.â€\\x9d Trump has been widely condemned as a demagogue after calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US and promising to build a wall on the Mexican border, branding immigrants as rapists and criminals. A 2005 video recording emerged in which he bragged about groping women, after which a dozen women came forward with claims of sexual assault and harassment. He has been ostracised by key members of his own party. The final days of his campaign were marked by a raucous incident in a rally in Reno on Saturday night, as Secret Service agents rushed the candidate from the stage. A protester named Austyn Crites who was holding a â€œRepublicans against Trumpâ€\\x9d sign apparently sparked the confused scene. Crites told the Trump supporters attacked him after he walked to the front of the rally and held up the sign. Eventually, someone shouted â€œgunâ€\\x9d, which led to law enforcement rushing Trump from the stage and briefly detaining Crites. Conway said on Sunday: â€œWeâ€™re told that he is a â€˜Republicanâ€™ who has canvassed for Hillary Clinton and donated money to her campaign.â€\\x9d Crites told the he was a Republican and fiscal conservative but had canvassed â€œfor a few hoursâ€\\x9d with the Clinton campaign in Nevada, because he wanted to do all he could to prevent a Trump presidency. He described Trump as â€œa textbook version of a dictator and a fascistâ€\\x9d. Trumpâ€™s son, Donald Jr, and Dan Scavino, who runs his social media operation, retweeted a message that read: â€œHillary ran away from rain today. Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attemptâ€\\x9d. No weapon was found. Although Trump rallies have long been marked by violence and unrest, they had been comparatively peaceful in recent months as the candidate has become increasingly scripted. Rhetorically, Trump has turned his ire on celebrity Clinton supporters Jay Z and BeyoncÃ©. â€œI donâ€™t need BeyoncÃ© and I donâ€™t need Jay Z,â€\\x9d he declared in a Denver rodeo barn. He also criticised Jay Z for lyrics in some of the songs performed at his Friday night concert for Clinton in Cleveland in the battleground state of Ohio. â€œMy language is nothing to compared to what Jay Z was doing last night and BeyoncÃ©,â€\\x9d Trump said, adding: â€œMy language is like baby talk.â€\\x9d Clinton has appeared with other celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Katy Perry and Jon Bon Jovi. At a get-out-the-vote concert on Saturday night, Perry told roughly 10,000 fans in Philadelphia her parents were lifelong Republicans. â€œBut itâ€™s not about where you come from, itâ€™s about what you grow into,â€\\x9d she said. Trump also made his first explicit accusations of voter fraud in the 2016 election. Only minutes before the incident that caused Secret Service agents to rush him from the stage in Reno, he claimed: â€œItâ€™s being reported certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring Democratic voters in. â€œFolks, itâ€™s a rigged system, itâ€™s a rigged system,â€\\x9d he added, to loud boos, before insisting: â€œWeâ€™re going to beat it.â€\\x9d He was apparently referring to a Las Vegas supermarket where voters, most of whom were Hispanic, stood in line for hours to vote on Friday night. The length of lines meant that the early voting site did not close until 10pm. Trumpâ€™s words echoed allegations by Michael McDonald, the chair of the Nevada Republican party, who claimed before Trump took the stage: â€œLast night in Clark County, they kept a poll open until 10 oâ€™clock at night so a certain group can vote â€¦ You feel free right now? You think this is a free and easy election?â€\\x9d The Republican nominee has long made broad, baseless and vague accusations of â€œlarge-scale voter fraudâ€\\x9d. At the final presidential debate, he declined to say whether he would accept the result of the election. On Sunday, his vice-presidential candidate, Mike Pence, told Fox News Sunday: â€œThe campaign has made it very clear that a clear outcome, obviously, both sides will accept. But I think both campaigns have also been very clear that in the event of disputed results, they reserve all rights and remedies.â€\\x9d After the frantic final 48 hours on the trail, both Clinton and Trump will be in New York City on election night, with the Democrats having reportedly booked a firework display and the tycoon billing his planned event at a hotel as a â€œvictory partyâ€\\x9d. Conway said: â€œWe did not purchase fireworks because weâ€™re planning for a victory but weâ€™re working really hard toward it and not just assuming it.â€\\x9d Additional reporting by Dan Roberts\",\n",
              "  'The digested referendum campaign: Immigration! Economy! Immigration! Where did it all start? With rows over Maastricht back in the 1990s? With the rise of first the BNP and then Ukip in the 2000s? History is an endlessly rewriteable feast. But for the sake of convenience, letâ€™s say this referendum took shape as David Cameronâ€™s sop to the Eurosceptics in his own party. Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless â€“ remember him? â€“ had defected to Ukip and the prime minister was desperate to make sure no one else jumped ship before the 2015 general election. Open civil war is never a good look, so Dave promised a referendum sometime before the end of 2017 just to shut them up. What Dave hadnâ€™t counted on was having to go through with it. Like everyone else, he had assumed he would either be in opposition or part of another coalition government. Either way, he would have someone else to blame for his inability to deliver on his promises. But within weeks of the Conservative election victory the Tory Eurosceptics demanded their referendum payback, so Dave started visiting the 27 other EU member states frantically trying to renegotiate a better deal for the UK while insisting he was playing hardball. By February he had concluded his negotiations. Having spent the previous six months claiming the EU was urgently need in reform, Dave was now convinced the concessions he had achieved â€“ an emergency brake on in-work welfare benefits for migrants and a general promise for Germany and France to be a bit nicer to us â€“ were a major breakthrough and announced he was going to campaign vigorously for Britain to remain. Others were not so quick to come forward. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who had previously always spoken out against the EU, found himself at odds with the vast majority of his party and initially tried to pretend the referendum wasnâ€™t really happening before being forced to half-heartedly mumble pro-remain speeches from time to time. Theresa May was rather more successful in her Trappist vows and after whispering â€œIâ€™m backing remainâ€\\x9d so quietly that no one heard her, she retreated into a convent for the duration. She will go down in history as the most silent home secretary in British history. Anyone might think she was hedging her bets. As, it seemed, was Boris Johnson. Over the years, the former London mayor has contradicted himself on so many issues heâ€™s not an easy man to second guess, but Dave was fairly confident Boris would come out on his side. How wrong he was. After agonising for at least an hour during a game of tennis with his sister, Rachel, Boris decided the best way for him to advance his political career was to back Brexit. If Brexit were to win, Boris could be prime minister inside 18 months. â€œThis is the most difficult decision I have ever had to make,â€\\x9d he sobbed. Though you wouldnâ€™t have guessed that from his behaviour, as from then on he wasted no time in rubbishing the EU at every opportunity. With Boris coming out for Boris, the referendum campaign could begin in earnest. Oxford-educated Boris and Michael Gove v Oxford-educated Dave and George Osborne. Or in Borisâ€™s delusional mind, the little people v the establishment. Dave and George because it was hard to get any other high-profile politicians to campaign with them; and Boris and Michael because they had already fallen out with Nigel Farage and the Grassroots Out Ukip faction and because the public either didnâ€™t like their other supporters, such as Iain Duncan Smith, or had no idea who they were. Gisela Who? Initially the economy dominated the debate, with Osborne claiming every family would lose Â£4,300 a year and Boris insisting the UK gave the EU Â£350m a week. The Treasury select committee investigated both claims and found them both to be false, though Borisâ€™s were the work of greater fantasy. Boris dismissed this as Project Fear. Then every independent economic thinktank in the universe said Britain would be worse off if it left the EU, and Gove insisted we shouldnâ€™t trust experts and, besides, they were all just Nazi sympathisers. Every country in the universe â€“ apart from North Korea â€“ said Britain would be better off in the EU. Boris declared that Kim Jong-un might have a point. Having lost the economic argument, Boris and Gove shifted the debate to immigration. The way to reduce the number of immigrants, they insisted, was to stop people from the EU coming in and let in loads more migrants from outside the EU instead. That way, even if we had exactly the same number of immigrants we could take back control and prove the UK wasnâ€™t racist. Or something. Farage wasnâ€™t at all happy about this and launched a poster campaign suggesting that Britain was about to be over-run by the Syrian refugees who were actually in Slovenia. Within hours, the Labour MP Jo Cox had been murdered and the rest of Ukipâ€™s poster campaign was binned. Punctuating all this were a series of televised debates between the leaders of the campaigns in which everyone said exactly the same thing they had been saying for the four months. At some point, Corbyn might even have joined in to say something about workersâ€™ rights. The leave supporters cheered everything Boris said, the remain supporters cheered everything Dave said, and the polls remained neck and neck.',\n",
              "  'Eric Blackâ€™s optimism for Aston Villa fails to address pressing issues The depth of the crisis at Aston Villa is summed up by Doug Ellis urging the current owner Randy Lerner to take a â€œmore hands-on approachâ€\\x9d. Ellis was not the most popular proprietor of the club before he sold Villa to the American in 2006. The buck for Villaâ€™s first relegation of the Premier League era, though, stops with Lerner and Ellisâ€™s message to him resonates. â€œI only wish he could spend a little more time in the UK supporting Aston Villa rather than following them on his phone or on his television,â€\\x9d Ellis told the BBC. â€œHe made a promise to put in Â£200m and he has kept that promise, and I made my promise not to interfere and I have not broken my word.â€\\x9d The first thing Lerner should do is reverse a culture of excuses. After this defeat to Manchester United confirmed Villaâ€™s drop into the Championship, Eric Black was twice offered the chance to describe their campaign as a shambles yet the caretaker-manager hid behind platitudes. He was speaking as Joleon Lescott claimed that going down was a â€œweight offâ€\\x9d the teamâ€™s shoulders; the latest disconnect between club and fans in a season studded with miserable displays and unprofessional conduct. Villa have been bottom of the table since 25 October after 10 games, when they had four points, two fewer than Newcastle United and Sunderland. In the 24 games since, the 1982 European Cup winners have taken a barely credible 12 points. Yet when asked if shambolic was a fair description of this, Black refused to send a message to the Villa players and, just as importantly, their fans, which is simply not good enough. â€œEveryone has their own adjectives they like to use,â€\\x9d said the Scot. â€œIt has been a difficult season for everybody involved with Aston Villa. Having spoken to a lot of people at Villa the only thing that is in their mind is taking this big club back and, hopefully, the supporters will get a feeling for that. â€œThere is no point standing here and criticising. Thatâ€™s done, itâ€™s over; we should be looking to rebuild and if that can start on Monday morning then great, because this is a fantastic football club. There is nobody who would deny that.â€\\x9d Perhaps Black could explain to travelling Villa fans why there is no point criticising. Especially after witnessing Marcus Rashfordâ€™s seventh goal for United consign Villa to a 24th league defeat. Or after he appeared hard-pressed to convince all of his players to applaud their loyal support, who had lent Old Trafford the sort of atmosphere one might expect from the home fans. Admittedly Black has only been in charge since 31 March, but given he is not responsible for the shambles, there was more freedom for him to speak clearly. Who might take over permanently is a crucial decision for Lerner and a new executive board, which includes the chairman Steve Hollis, former player and manager Brian Little and Adrian Bevington, once a high-ranking Football Association executive. David Moyes, Nigel Pearson, and Brendan Rodgers are all being mentioned. Each would be sure to try to establish the fierce work ethic, focus and stability required. But would they take the job? Black believes there will be a queue to do so. â€œI am sure there will be a thousand people who will want to sit in that seat,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThe infrastructure of the club is set, there are fantastic facilities and the stadium and supporters are second to none. â€œI donâ€™t know how many clubs would have 30,000-35,000 coming to games when they have hardly seen a victory. They deserve enormous credit for that. The stadium is in place. We need to rebuild the team into something the supporters can be proud of.â€\\x9d The big challenge now is for Villa to bounce straight back up. If they do not, and remain outside the Premier League for the next three years, they could lose Â£200m in broadcast revenue alone. Black said: â€œIt is going to be very difficult but I donâ€™t think anybody is under any illusions. There are an extra eight games to start with. The physicality is different to the Premier League and we are a big, big fish in [the Championship]. These are all elements you have to consider. I donâ€™t think anybody is under any illusion this is going to be plain sailing. It is a fantastic challenge and one people at this club will be trying their utmost to meet. â€œI am sure whoever takes over will ensure that work ethic carries on and if we can get the right squad together then we can bounce straight back, but it will be no easy task.â€\\x9d The challenge starts now.

              "  'The Attention Merchants review â€“ how the web is being debased for profit Tim Wu is an expert on concentrations of power. An author, activist and lawyer, he is most famous for coining the phrase â€œnet neutralityâ€\\x9d â€“ the idea that the oligopoly that owns our internet infrastructure shouldnâ€™t charge differently for different kinds of data. In his new book, he targets another kind of corporate domination: the industry that monopolises our attention. According to Wu, this industry emerged from the first world war. In 1914 Germany could mobilise 4.5 million men; the best Britain could do was 700,000. To build a bigger army, the British government embarked on the first systematic propaganda campaign in history. It printed 50 million big, colourful recruitment posters and plastered them on shops, houses, buses and trams throughout the country. It staged rallies and parades. It filled vans with film projectors and screened patriotic films in towns across Britain. And it worked: stirred by this unprecedented experiment in state-sponsored persuasion, millions of young men marched off to gruesome, pointless deaths in a gruesome, pointless war. Wu identifies this moment as a major turning point in what he calls the â€œindustrialisation of human attention captureâ€\\x9d. The overwhelming success of the British propaganda effort proved â€œthe power of mass attentionâ€\\x9d, he writes, and taught corporations everywhere a valuable lesson. If governments could convince their citizens to choke to death on poison gas in a foreign country, surely the private sector could apply the same techniques to persuade people to buy things. Thus the modern advertising industry was born. Like many lucrative industries then and since, advertising took a publicly financed innovation and repurposed it for profit. Over the course of the 1920s, a powerful class of commercial propagandists emerged, particularly in the US. In addition to enriching themselves and their corporate clients, these â€œattention merchantsâ€\\x9d performed a critical economic function. Many decades of rapid industrial expansion in the capitalist west had produced an excess of productive capacity. One way to deal with this problem had been to conquer parts of Asia and Africa and make new markets by force â€“ imperialism. Another was to boost demand at home, by creating new desires for consumer goods and allowing wage levels to rise to the point where people could act on them. The first involved literal colonisation; the latter, the colonisation of everyday life. Wuâ€™s book tells the story of this conquest, recording the extraordinarily successful attempts by advertisers to occupy more and more of our attention over the past 100 years. It is less a history of advertising than of how this enclosure happened: the technologies, platforms and formats that have made it possible for media to penetrate an ever-growing portion of our waking lives. Wu is no technological determinist. While he acknowledges that the invention of radio, television and the internet created enormous new potential for attention capture, heâ€™s careful to point out that there was nothing inevitable about that potential being fulfilled. Just because new tools made it easier to reach more people didnâ€™t guarantee people would pay attention. To use Wuâ€™s metaphor, companies had to cultivate attention before they could harvest it. Sometimes this involved creating an entirely new cultural form, such as the radio serial or reality TV. Sometimes it involved improving an existing one, like Oprahâ€™s elevation of the tabloid talkshow format into respectable middlebrow fare. Wuâ€™s book crams many case studies into its pages, but the basic recipe remains remarkably consistent over the years. Companies come up with new ways to get our attention, and then sell that attention to other companies. And as mass media mediates more of our time â€“ as the average Americanâ€™s media consumption goes from an hour spent huddled around the family radio to endless hours on Google or Twitter or Facebook â€“ the amount of attention available for resale grows. Occasionally, however, people revolt. In the 1930s, a rising consumer movement forced the US federal government to start policing ads for factual inaccuracies. In the 1950s, the invention of the remote control gave television watchers the power to press mute â€“ thus â€œarming a new popular resistance against the industrialised harvest of attentionâ€\\x9d, Wu writes. Yet these small rebellions did little to halt advertisingâ€™s ascent. If anything, they probably accelerated it. One of the most interesting observations from Wuâ€™s history is that advertising adapts to resistance extremely well. Like a mutant strain of bacteria that nurses on antibiotics to become invincible, advertising uses its enemies to grow stronger â€“ not only by co-opting any and all countercultures, from hippiedom to punk rock to hip-hop, but by recruiting its greatest haters into its ranks. As Wu observes, both Google and Facebook were founded by engineers who despised online ads. So they created better ones: ads that slip more easily into your field of view and speak more specifically to your searches and likes and clicks. They ended up with the worldâ€™s most sophisticated machinery for converting attention into cash, the basis of a business model that makes Madison Avenue at the height of the Don Draper era look poor and unimaginative by comparison. Wuâ€™s book isnâ€™t just a history. Itâ€™s a polemic. The reason we need to understand where the attention industry comes from, he believes, is because it poses a mortal threat to human happiness and flourishing. It does this by inhibiting good attention, and encouraging bad attention. Good attention is â€œdeep, long-lasting and voluntaryâ€\\x9d â€“ the kind we get from reading a book. Bad attention is â€œquick, superficial and often involuntarily provokedâ€\\x9d â€“ the kind we get from checking our Twitter mentions. Good attention is the spiritual space needed for self-realisation. Bad attention makes us stupider, more susceptible to advertising and â€œless ourselvesâ€\\x9d. This is an ancient complaint, and a rather silly one. Every media innovation since the invention of writing has triggered a moral panic about whether the human experience would be hopelessly corrupted as a result. Socrates agonised about wax tablets; the monks of the late middle ages railed against the printing press. In Wuâ€™s case, however, the impulse is particularly unfortunate because it derails his discussion of the subject where he has the most expertise: the internet. There are few people more qualified than him to perform a nuanced analysis of online attention capture. Instead, he devotes the last 50 pages of his book to denouncing Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and BuzzFeed for destroying the internet. In their hunger for advertising revenue, Wu declares, these companies have degraded the digital sphere into a â€œcesspoolâ€\\x9d of selfies, images of celebrities, listicles â€“ anything that might cultivate clicks by catering to the â€œvery basest human impulses of voyeurism and titillationâ€\\x9d. Thereâ€™s no doubt Silicon Valleyâ€™s appetite for attention has debased public discourse. In the aftermath of Donald Trumpâ€™s victory, many commentators have blamed Facebook for spreading fake news stories that played a role in the result. And even the most cursory user of social media knows that Nazis love Twitter. Under the cynical pretext of â€œfree speechâ€\\x9d, the tech giants have long since decided that capital accumulation trumps any civic or ethical considerations. After all, Nazi eyeballs pay just as well as non-Nazi ones. Yet even amid post-election pessimism, this characterisation feels far too harsh. Wu sees contemporary digital life as wholly, irredeemably corrupt. As a result, itâ€™s nearly impossible to recognise the actual internet in his cartoonish portrait. Absent is Twitterâ€™s contribution to political organising, for instance, or BuzzFeedâ€™s valuable reporting on sexual assault. These oversights would be more forgivable coming from someone with less expertise, or a smaller soapbox. But Wu enjoys a reputation as one of the USâ€™s foremost thinkers on technology, and his opinions influence people. When he condemns the contemporary internet as an exercise in mass idiocy, he risks doing real damage to public debate. His outlook also forecloses the possibility of forming an adequate political response. Wu is right to sound the alarm about advertisingâ€™s total takeover of our â€œattentional environmentâ€\\x9d. Corporate domination of the internet is an urgent political problem, as the US election has starkly demonstrated. But when it comes to potential solutions, Wuâ€™s moralism leads him to a dead end. Our best hope, he believes, is a personal improvement project: he asks us to spend less time on the internet, and more time doing things that demand a â€œserious level of concentrationâ€\\x9d. This will empower us to â€œmake our attention our own againâ€\\x9d, he says, â€œand so reclaim ownership of the very experience of livingâ€\\x9d. Even if you accept the dubious premise that our wholeness as human beings depends on whether we read books or BuzzFeed, this proposal is incapable of producing actual change. The attention industry can easily absorb individual gestures of defiance. A stronger approach requires collective solutions. As Wu points out, the attention merchants of Silicon Valley earn billions of dollars a year from our data. By posting, searching and liking, we perform the free labour that powers one of the most profitable sectors of the economy. Itâ€™s not unreasonable to expect that our contributions should entitle us to a say over how these platforms are governed â€“ including how and when they sell our attention to advertisers. This means democratising the digital sphere, not abandoning it. â€¢ The Attention Merchants: From the Daily Newspaper to Social Media, How Our Time and Attention Is Harvested and Sold is published by Atlantic.

              "  \"Jay Z shades Phil Jackson's 'posse' remark at Sports Illustrated LeBron fete Jay Z took a shot at New York Knicks president Phil Jacksonâ€™s use of the term â€œposseâ€\\x9d in reference to LeBron Jamesâ€™ business partners during his speech to introduce the Cleveland Cavaliers star as Sports Illustratedâ€™s Sportperson of the Year on Monday night. The musicianâ€™s remarks praised James as â€œthe son who honors and worships his mother, Gloria. The friend who put his posse in position.â€\\x9d The audience at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn laughed at the reference to Jacksonâ€™s comment as James appeared to playfully mouth â€œshut upâ€\\x9d from his table. â€œWe do understand where we come from, and the only difference between us and someone who has their MBA from Wharton or Sloan or Berkeley or Stanford is opportunity. LeBron James has provided his friends with that opportunity. And as we witness their development, and if weâ€™re looking up at the scoreboard, very few, very few businessmen are better than Maverick Carter, Rich Paul, Randy Mims and all the rest of the â€˜posseâ€™ behind the scenes that make it look like theyâ€™re just hanging out. â€œLeBron James has made all of those around him better on and off the court. We acknowledge and recognize all he has done for the game. But tonight, LeBron, we say thank you. Not just for your commitment to basketball. We say thank you for all you have done in the community. And thank you for how youâ€™ve enriched the lives of everyone around you. You messed around and got a triple-double in real life.â€\\x9d Jackson, twice an NBA champion as a Knicks player and the winner of a league-record 11 titles as a coach with the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, had used the term in an interview with ESPN last month. â€œIt had to hurt when [the Miami Heat] lost LeBron,â€\\x9d Jackson said. â€œThat was definitely a slap in the face. But there were a lot of little things that came out of that. When LeBron was playing with the Heat, they went to Cleveland, and he wanted to spend the night. They donâ€™t do overnights. Teams just donâ€™t. So now [coach Erik] Spoelstra has to text [Pat] Riley and say, â€˜What do I do in this situation?â€™ And Pat, who has iron-fist rules, answers: â€˜You are on the plane. You are with this team.â€™ You canâ€™t hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in Cleveland. â€œI always thought Pat had this really nice vibe with his guys. But something happened there where it broke down. I do know LeBron likes special treatment. He needs things his way.â€\\x9d James responded harshly to the use of the term, saying it carries a connotation that underscores the difficulties young African-Americans have in gaining respect, especially in the business world. The four-times NBA Most Valuable Player drew further attention on Monday when the cover of the Sportsperson of the Year issue was unveiled featuring a portrait of James wearing a safety pin on his lapel. Since last monthâ€™s presidential election, the safety pin has become a symbol of solidarity with those Americans who fear they will be disenfranchised by a Donald Trump presidency. The pin is intended to show that the wearer is a safe person to turn to. James campaigned for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the days before the vote. During a recent road trip, James opted to stay elsewhere than the teamâ€™s official Trump-branded hotel in New York. He called the decision a personal preference.\",\n",
              "  \"The bigger they come: how to film an 'unfilmable' book The common wisdom in screenwriting is that bad novels make great movies and great novels turn into duds. I can think of plenty of arguments to disprove the theory, though â€“ from The English Patient to Apocalypse Now (adapted from Joseph Conradâ€™s Heart of Darkness), from LA Confidential to The Age of Innocence, from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to The Lord of the Rings. What all these adaptations inherit from their source material is ambition: like the novels that came before them, they aspire to greatness, in terms of either scale or emotion. If you set out to adapt a classic, youâ€™d better pray itâ€™s going to be a great film because youâ€™ll be held to a very high standard. An adaptation of a bad book may face other criticisms, but at least it wonâ€™t constantly be compared to a famous parent. Taking the family analogy further, the most successful adaptations are often like wayward children who break away from the shadow of their famous parents to forge an identity of their own. They want to match their parentsâ€™ success but in their own way. Anthony Minghella, when describing his adaptation of The English Patient, said he read the book numerous times before he started his screenplay but then never looked at it again. In effect, he was raised by his parents, then left home. He let the memory and emotional impact of the novel guide him rather than the text. Later this year, Ewan McGregor will make his directorial debut with an adaptation of Philip Rothâ€™s American Pastoral, the winner of a Pulitzer prize and one of Time magazineâ€™s top 100 books of the 20th century. It is the story of Seymour â€œSwedeâ€\\x9d Levov as told by his former classmate, Nathan Zuckerman. Itâ€™s the investigation of a life, a family saga, an exploration of American society in the 60s and 70s, and takes in momentous events such as the Vietnam war and Watergate. On top of that, its themes deal with the â€œunknowabilityâ€\\x9d of people, a tricky proposition for a medium such as film. Even more challenging is Tom Fordâ€™s forthcoming adaptation of the novel Tony and Susan by Austin Wright, renamed Nocturnal Animals for the big screen and about to receive its premiere at the Venice film festival. In the book, twin narratives run side by side. A university professor, Susan, reads a crime thriller called Nocturnal Animals written by her ex-husband, Edward. Itâ€™s fast-paced and terrifying while Susanâ€™s reflections on her ex-husbandâ€™s manuscript are deliberately slow-paced and contemplative. The novel is half revenge thriller, half internal drama: a complex work of metafiction that explores the idea that all texts are fluid and that the meaning of a book depends on the person reading it. Daunting perhaps, but also potentially liberating. The biggest advantage of adapting an impossible book is that no one expects you to be entirely slavish to the source material. Theyâ€™re not expecting a filmic replica. As a screenwriter, Iâ€™ve had two experiences of adapting â€œimpossible booksâ€\\x9d: Henry Jamesâ€™s The Wings of the Dove and James Sallisâ€™s Drive. Although theyâ€™re very different novels, theyâ€™re both told largely through internal narratives â€“ they describe the characterâ€™s thoughts and emotions rather than depicting actual scenes or events. So where does one start? The advantage of adapting great novels is that they provide you with great characters. The Wings of the Dove and Drive may not have had many set pieces or long dialogue scenes I could lift, but they had whole chapters describing a characterâ€™s life history or thought processes. The characters were so intimately drawn, I felt I could imagine exactly how theyâ€™d behave or react in any given circumstance. I felt confident I could invent scenes that were not in the books and still stay true to the integrity of the characters â€“ and the intentions of their authors. The pleasure in adapting these books was that they allowed me to bring some of my own experiences and emotions to the process. As a student, Iâ€™d spent some time in Venice with university friends and many of our experiences and the locations we visited found their way into the Wings of the Dove script. Around the same time, I also spent several months living on my own in Rome and some of the loneliness of that informed the Drive screenplay. I flatter myself when I say they felt halfway between adaptations and original screenplays, but thatâ€™s really a testament to the greatness of the novels. They not only allow you to see something of yourself in them, they allow you to project. Just as, in Tony and Susan, the readerâ€™s experience of the book becomes as important as the words on the page. Similarly, every adaptation will be different depending on whoâ€™s writing it. An Aaron Sorkin adaptation of Wuthering Heights will bear no resemblance to the Quentin Tarantino version, even though they come from the same source. The least successful adaptations Iâ€™ve done are those without personality. When there are no spaces to fill in, the process becomes mechanical. The adaptation simply becomes a choice of which scenes to retain from the book and which ones to leave out. The inevitable result is a filleting of the novel. It becomes a hollow replica, the basic plot without its heart and soul. If I could describe my ideal approach to an adaptation it would go something like this. I lie down on a sofa, which is where I like to read, and open a book. Gradually, I get lost in it. I flick over certain sections that lose my attention and re-read others that move or intrigue me. I pause occasionally and think that something like that happened to me, or drift off to imagine myself in the characterâ€™s shoes. Sometimes Iâ€™ll put the book down to take a rest or reflect on a shocking moment, then return to it because I canâ€™t put it down for long. I read faster and faster as I approach the end, probably skipping the odd paragraph because I canâ€™t wait to find out what happens. When I finally finish, I collapse â€“ and think nobody else in the world understood or experienced that book exactly like I did. The challenge of any adaptation is capturing that first, unique, individual reading experience â€“ and bottling it over the months and years it takes to make a film.\",\n",
              "  'Democrats seek injunction against Trump allies over voter intimidation concerns Democratic party officials in four swing states have sought federal court injunctions against the Trump campaign and its affiliates, alleging they plan to intimidate minority voters on election day. The lawsuits argue that the Trump campaign, along with the nomineeâ€™s close confidant Roger Stone and state Republican party officials, is â€œconspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from votingâ€\\x9d, citing Trumpâ€™s continuing efforts to recruit â€œelection observersâ€\\x9d and Stoneâ€™s plans, as revealed by the , to conduct unorthodox â€œexit pollingâ€\\x9d on election day, as evidence of potentially â€œvirulent harassmentâ€\\x9d. The lawsuits follow another legal action taken in federal court in New Jersey last week by the Democratic National Committee, which argues that the Republican National Committee is in violation of a 1982 consent decree that forbids the organisation from monitoring polls on election day. Stone told the last week his group â€œStop The Stealâ€\\x9d planned to conduct exit polling in nine major cities in swing states, ostensibly to counter â€œelection theftâ€\\x9d and gauge the accuracy of electronic voting machines. But a number of polling and election law experts cast doubts on the methodology and suggested the process could be a smokescreen for voter intimidation. For months, Donald Trump has warned supporters of a â€œrigged electionâ€\\x9d and encouraged them to monitor polling areas in cities such as St Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. The lawsuits, filed by state Democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target. The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trumpâ€™s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south, and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters. Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but they could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stoneâ€™s exit polling. â€œIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities, and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,â€\\x9d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California whose Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday. The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey, when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods. These volunteers wore armbands that identified them as an unofficial â€œBallot Security Task Forceâ€\\x9d and erected posters warning against voter fraud. The RNC last week said claims it was now in violation of the consent decree, set to expire at the start of 2017, were â€œcompletely meritlessâ€\\x9d. Stoneâ€™s exit pollers, self-titled â€œvote protectorsâ€\\x9d, had originally planned to use similar non-official identification badges, until these were removed from the organisationâ€™s website late last week. The organisation is still encouraging its volunteers to livestream video from polling stations. In an emailed statement, Stone dismissed the lawsuits as â€œwithout meritâ€\\x9d and argued the lawyers who filed them â€œcould face sanctionsâ€\\x9d. The former Richard Nixon adviser said the polling was not being coordinated with the Trump campaign or the RNC. â€œWe seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if thatâ€™s not the case,â€\\x9d Stone said. â€œI assume the purpose of this bogus lawsuit is to distract from the voter fraud the Democrats have traditionally engaged in.â€\\x9d The contacted the Trump campaign and the Clinton campaignâ€™s general legal counsel for a response to the recent lawsuits and is awaiting a response.',\n",
              "  \"Gay men can't donate blood to victims of the Orlando shooting. That's absurd Last night at Pulse, an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, 50 of our LGBT brothers and sisters were taken from us. Today, like so many others in my community, I am overcome with a sense of helplessness. I am overcome with the urge to do something, anything, to help the victims and their families. Many in Orlando feel a similar urge. People are lining up to give blood in the wake of the massacre. But gay and bisexual men who want to give today are encountering an obstacle: the FDA requires a year of celibacy before men who have sex with men can donate blood. These new rules were put into practice in late 2015. They were presented as an end to the ban on gay menâ€™s blood â€“ but they still mean even gay men who have been in a completely monogamous relationship for a year are barred from donating. Regulations against gay blood arrived in 1983 in response to the panic surrounding the HIV/Aids epidemic. The American Medical Association called for an end to the ban in 2013, saying it was discriminatory and without a sound scientific basis. HIV-positive donors can be screened out and only one in 2m transfusions result in an HIV infection. In short, the ban on gay blood is unjustified. Other countries, such as Argentina, have already done away with it. Misinformation spread on social media Sunday, saying that the ban on gay blood has been temporarily lifted in Orlando because of high need. This is actually false, as local donor service OneBlood confirms. It is an outrage that our blood can be spilled but not donated. It is an outrage that, despite the facts and despite calls to lift the ban from experts across the country, homophobia and gay panic keeps it in place. Thank God for groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, one Muslim group mobilizing support to keep blood supplies up. As we celebrate Pride â€“ and yes, we will celebrate even in the wake of tragedy, as we always have â€“ let us remember our radical roots. Above all, Pride is a celebration of resistance. It is a celebration of our audacity to exist. And so, in the spirit of Pride, in the spirit of Stonewall, in the spirit of our LGBT family members who have been stolen from us too soon, let us continue to resist. Today is a painful reminder that there are still so many battles left for us to fight. The oppressive, outdated policy on queer blood is one, and it must come to an end. I look forward to a future where we can express our solidarity with those who are harmed or in need through our needed donations. This article was amended on 13 June 2016. An earlier version stated that one in 2m HIV infections are caused by transfusions. In fact, one in 2m transfusions result in an HIV infection.\",\n",
              "  'Scientist Mary Somerville to appear on Scottish Â£10 note The scientist Mary Somerville will be the first woman other than a royal to appear on a Royal Bank of Scotland banknote â€“ but only after a stewardâ€™s inquiry over an apparent attempt to rig the vote. Some 4,100 people voted via Facebook for Somerville, whose academic writing played a pivotal role in the discovery of the planet Neptune, to appear on a new Â£10 note. A groundswell of support, including a Facebook campaign by students at the Oxford University college bearing her name, put Somerville way out in front on Sunday, the last day of voting. Rival candidate Thomas Telford, the civil engineer known affectionately as the â€œColossus of Roadsâ€\\x9d, could only muster a meagre 500 votes with just hours to spare. But a last-minute surge of voting, much of it from India but also from other countries, saw Telford accelerate past Somerville to reach 5,100 votes by the deadline. James Clerk Maxwell, the physicist whose study of electromagnetism inspired Albert Einstein, limped home a distant third. But after discussions between Facebook and RBS, the late influx of votes was deemed suspicious. RBS later declared the result null and void, meaning Somervilleâ€™s face will adorn the bankâ€™s new polymer Â£10 notes from 2017. â€œIt looks as if something dodgy has gone on. Mary Somerville was clearly the publicâ€™s choice,â€\\x9d said the source. The decision to overturn the result means Somerville will become the first woman other than the Queen to appear on a mainstream RBS banknote issue since they were first printed in 1727. â€œHaving the opportunity to choose the face of our new Â£10 notes obviously meant a great deal to a great number of people,â€\\x9d said the RBS Scotland chair, Malcolm Buchanan. â€œMary Somervilleâ€™s immense contribution to science and her determination to succeed against all the odds clearly resonate as much today as they did during her lifetime.â€\\x9d Born in 1780, Somervilleâ€™s relative wealth allowed her access to education in astronomy and geography, despite living in an age when women were discouraged from studying science. She is credited with an instrumental role in the discovery of Neptune, thanks to her writing on a hypothetical planet perturbing the orbit of Uranus. Somerville, who died in 1872, is also indelibly linked to the advancement of women in academia, having given her name to the Oxford college that initially only admitted women. Alumni of Somerville College, founded in 1879, include the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the TV presenter Esther Rantzen and the former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. RBSâ€™s decision to include a woman on its shortlist follows a high-profile row in 2013, when the Bank of England faced criticism for replacing the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on the Â£5 note from 2016. The decision left no women on English banknotes at all, prompting a successful campaign led by the journalist Caroline Criado-Perez to put the face of Jane Austen on the Â£10 note.',\n",
              "  'How memory apps can help people with dementia tap into their past More than 650,000 people in England have dementia and that figure is expected to double by 2040. With wildly differing standards of care across the country, there is growing interest in the role technology could play. When Robert Armstrong was admitted to The Uplands care home in Shrewsbury, he had a habit of waking up in the middle of night and wandering about. At first staff thought he was just a poor sleeper, but the 68-year-old would become very aggressive when care workers tried to guide him back to bed. He would often need medication to calm him down. It wasnâ€™t until care workers started working more closely with the family to map his life history that they discovered Armstrong had been a milkman for 40 years and thought he was getting up to go to his job. â€œSo when he woke up at 3am, the night staff gave him a cup of tea and biscuits and then he did his â€˜roundsâ€™,â€\\x9d says Mandy Thorn, managing director at Uplands. â€œRobert had a milk crate in his room and he went round leaving milk bottles outside all the residentsâ€™ doors. At 6am he had breakfast and went back to bed, while staff picked up the bottles and put them back in his crate, ready for the next day.â€\\x9d Thorn says the effect was instant and transformed Armstrongâ€™s quality of life until his death in early 2015. â€œWe had no more aggression and no need for medication to calm him down. And he was really happy until the day he died.â€\\x9d Thorn hopes the delay in finding out such crucial information will soon be a thing of the past. From September, Uplands will be using RemindMeCare, an app that uses reminiscence therapy to get people with dementia talking about their memories. Its software automatically creates content that matches the person with dementiaâ€™s life story. In addition to photos, the system pulls images of events, favourites places, films and music from the web to create a detailed multimedia profile of the person. This is then used to help stimulate conversation and memories enabling carers to build a better relationship with the individual. For group activities, the software can work out shared interests and help several residents to take part. And family members can upload relevant information to their relativeâ€™s profile and be actively involved in their care. â€œThe more that you know about an individual, the easier it is to care for them,â€\\x9d says Thorn. â€œIt will transform our business, make us more efficient, so staff spend more time with our residents, not on paperwork. With ReMindMeCare you have a digital record [of activities and interventions], you donâ€™t have to worry about writing it all down.â€\\x9d RemindMeCare is the brainchild of Simon Hooper and Etienne Abrahams, who both had family members with dementia. When his mother got dementia, Hooper started to put her life story on to a tablet for her carers to use. â€œI realised that early memories were the key to communicating with those with dementia and to improving person-centred care, and that it needed tech to record them, so that the memories would not be lost and would be available to each carer in turn,â€\\x9d he says. On meeting Abrahams at a party and discovering that he was building software to store his grandmotherâ€™s memories, photos and favourite music, they both realised there was a gap in the market and decided to develop a business. After a yearâ€™s planning, they raised money from care experts and crowdfunding and RemindMeCare was born in November 2015. Samir Patel, owner of Oaklands Rest Home in the New Forest, Hampshire, which has been using the system since May, says: â€œItâ€™s had a huge impact on our residents. Itâ€™s a nice way to engage with your loved one. You can still contribute to their life in a really positive way.â€\\x9d Not all dementia apps are designed for use in care settings. This month saw the launch of two new apps that people with dementia can use independently (as well as with a carer, if they choose). Book of You and Playlist for Life use photos, words and music to enable those with dementia to reminisce with carers, family and friends, about things that were important in their lives. These apps are part of a dementia citizens project run by the innovation charity Nesta. Both apps also aim to foster in-depth research on how technology can empower people with dementia to lead more fulfilling lives. Academics at Bangor and Glasgow Caledonian universities, who developed Book of You and Playlist for Life respectively, will conduct regular surveys with 500 users of the apps. â€œWe want to show that technology improves the lives of those with dementia,â€\\x9d says John Loder, head of strategy at Nestaâ€™s health lab. â€œWho do these apps really work for and how?â€\\x9d The data may also challenge stereotypes. Early testing for Playlist for Life found that dementia patients did not necessarily want to listen to West End musical hits or the Beatles. â€œIt is very easy to make assumptions about people with dementia and what they are going to like. The only thing they really wanted to listen to was Adele,â€\\x9d says Loder. â€œThey liked the fact that they are listening to the same music as their children and grandchildren.â€\\x9d Some names have been changed',\n",
              "  'Anthony Mackie to play Johnnie Cochran in police brutality drama Anthony Mackie is set to follow in the recent footsteps of Courtney B Vance by playing Johnnie Cochran, in a new film about a landmark police brutality case. According to Deadline, the Captain America: Civil War star will play the lawyer during a 1981 case that preceded his defence of OJ Simpson in 1995, a trial that was recently dramatised for the small screen. The role of Cochran in the TV series, The People v OJ Simpson, was played by Vance in a widely-praised performance. The as yet untitled big-screen drama focuses on the story of American football player Ron Settles, who was arrested for speeding and later found dead in his cell. It was initially deemed a suicide, but an autopsy showed that Settles had been choked to death. The family were awarded $760,000 in a civil suit and the police chief resigned. The film is written by David McMillan, who has worked on TV drama Lucifer, with a director yet to be announced. Mackie is currently starring in Captain America: Civil War, after roles in Triple 9 and The Night Before and will next be seen on television, playing Martin Luther King Jr in the HBO drama All the Way. Heâ€™s also set to star in thriller Wetlands and is developing a film about Olympian sprinter Jesse Owens. As well as OJ Simpson, Cochranâ€™s celebrity clients included Michael Jackson, Tupac and Snoop Dogg. He died in 2005.',\n",
              "  \"Aleksandar Hemon defends Donald Trump's right to electoral â€˜job interviewâ€™ After hundreds of authors signed an open letter last week opposing Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy for US president, the acclaimed Bosnian author Aleksandar Hemon, based in the US since 1992, has spoken out about why he decided not to join them. The authors, who numbered more than 450 and have since been joined by more than 20,000 fellow signatories, include some of US literatureâ€™s biggest names, from Stephen King to Lydia Davis. In their â€œopen letter to the American peopleâ€\\x9d, they say that they â€œoppose, unequivocally, the candidacy of Donald J Trump for the presidency of the United Statesâ€\\x9d, and that â€œany democracy worthy of the name rests on pluralism, welcomes principled disagreement, and achieves consensus through reasoned debateâ€\\x9d. But Hemon, who was awarded a so-called â€œgenius grantâ€\\x9d from the MacArthur Foundation in 2004, writes in a piece for the Literary Hub that while he too â€œdeplore[s] Trump and everything he and his squirrel-pelt hair stand forâ€\\x9d, he wonâ€™t sign. If the writers want to oppose Trumpâ€™s candidacy, he says, the way to do this is to vote against him. â€œItâ€™s true, as the writers assert, that â€˜the history of dictatorship is the history of manipulation and division, demagoguery and liesâ€™,â€\\x9d Hemon continues, â€œbut Trump is presently abiding by the rules of democratic election, as are his followers, rabid as they may beâ€\\x9d. â€œItâ€™s also true,â€\\x9d Hemon adds, â€œthat neither wealth nor celebrity qualifies anyone to speak for the US, to lead its military, to maintain its alliances, or to represent its people. But what would qualify Trump to speak for the US is his being elected in the fall. Horrifying as that may seem, thatâ€™s how the system works â€“ the election is the job interview.â€\\x9d Hemonâ€™s comments follow a speech from JK Rowling last month, in which the Harry Potter author said that while Trump is â€œobjectionable â€¦ offensive and bigotedâ€\\x9d, he still has the right to visit the UK, despite a petition last year calling for him to be banned. â€œIf you seek the removal of freedoms from an opponent simply on the grounds that they have offended you, you have crossed a line to stand alongside tyrants who imprison, torture and kill on exactly the same justifications,â€\\x9d said Rowling. Hemon goes on in his essay to ask if the authors would have written a letter opposing the candidacy of Ted Cruz, â€œwho is just as hateful as Trumpâ€\\x9d, or Ben Carson, or George W Bush. â€œWhat is the threshold of acceptability? Being a professional politician? Being a Democrat? Not having short fingers? Not being Trump?â€\\x9d he asks. The author, whose novels include The Lazarus Project and The Book of My Lives, goes on to point out the lack of a novel â€œthat has forcefully addressed the iniquities of the post 9/11 eraâ€\\x9d. If the rise of Trump â€œis what it takes to get American writers back into politics, let us welcome the development,â€\\x9d he says, adding that â€œperhaps there is an author among the Open Letter signatories eager to develop a narrative in which Trump â€“ or his hairier, more narratively compelling avatar - wouldnâ€™t be the false cause of our discontent but a symbol of an America struggling to forestall its precipitous intellectual and political decline, to which the absence of its literature from its politics must have contributedâ€\\x9d. Trump, meanwhile, when quizzed for the Hollywood Reporter by the author and journalist Michael Wolff on what he is currently reading, has revealed a political bent to his own literary forays. Wolff writes: â€œHe knows heâ€™s caught (itâ€™s a question that all politicians are prepped on, but who among his not-bookish coterie would have prepped him even with the standard GOP politician answer: the Bible?). But he goes for it.â€\\x9d Trump tells Wolff he is reading â€œthe Ed Klein book on Hillary Clintonâ€\\x9d and â€œthe book on Richard Nixon that was, well, Iâ€™ll get you the exact information on itâ€\\x9d, as well as â€œa book that Iâ€™ve read before, itâ€™s one of my favourite books, All Quiet on the Western Front, which is one of the greatest books of all time.â€\\x9d It is, Wolff writes, â€œone I suspect heâ€™s suddenly remembering from high school. But what the hell.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Vote Leave forced to remove phone tycoons from supporters list The anti-EU Vote Leave campaign group has been forced to revise a list of more than 250 business supporters after it emerged that the names of two leading figures were wrongly included. Supporters of Britainâ€™s membership of the EU said that the Vote Leave letter published on Saturday, which was designed to show that credible business leaders support an EU exit and to which the list of names was attached, had fallen apart. Vote Leave amended its list after David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, and John Caudwell, the co-founder of Phones 4U, said their names had been wrongly included. A spokesman for Ross told the Sunday Times: â€œMr Ross has not made any commitment at all. We have no idea where this has come from. Mr Ross will make a decision one way or the other when he gets back from his Easter break in a couple of weeks.â€\\x9d A spokesman for Caudwell said he had not added his name to the list although he has supported a UK exit from the EU. â€œYou have to question how this list has been compiled,â€\\x9d the spokesman told the newspaper. The row is a setback to Vote Leave, which is working hard to overcome the perception that the pro-EU camp has the overwhelming support of British businesses. The letter was published on Saturday in conjunction with a YouGov poll which found that only 14% of more than 1,000 small or medium-sized businesses felt that the EU made it easier for businesses to employ people. The pro-EU Britain Stronger in Europe group said that the list did not include a single leader of a FTSE 100 company. It had earlier highlighted a survey which found that 82% of UK businesses favoured membership of the EU. The mix-up over the names is an echo of the embarrassing row when Downing Street was forced to apologise after wrongly including the retired SAS commander General Sir Michael Rose in a list of retired military figures who supported EU membership. Vote Leave seized on the mistake to accuse No 10 of â€œtrying to bully people into backing the EUâ€\\x9d. Nick Herbert, chairman of Conservatives In, said that Vote Leaveâ€™s claim that it has the support of business leaders had fallen apart. Herbert told the Sunday Times: â€œLess than 24 hours after its launch, the Vote Leave business letter is falling apart. Some of those named on the letter say they never signed it, many are not business â€˜leadersâ€™ at all â€“ there isnâ€™t a single FTSE 100 [chief executive] among them â€“ and others have publicly admitted Brexit would cause severe damage to Britainâ€™s economy.â€\\x9d A Vote Leave spokesman said: â€œMr Rossâ€™s name was included on our supporters list in error. We apologise for any confusion that has been caused. John Caudwell has been listed as a supporter of the campaign since he signed up in October last year. He has now been removed.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Turned off by Trump: Republican mega-donors focus on congressional races Several leading Republican donors and groups that spent large sums in the 2012 presidential campaign are either wavering or opting outright not to back Donald Trump this year. Instead, they are spending tens of millions of dollars on congressional races as fears mount that the candidateâ€™s poor poll numbers and incendiary gaffes are placing majorities in the House and Senate in danger. â€œI believe thereâ€™s an emerging consensus in the party that Trump isnâ€™t going to win,â€\\x9d Vin Weber, a former Minnesota representative turned lobbyist who helps raise money for House candidates, told the . â€œWe need to shift resources as much as we can to help down-ticket candidates including members of Congress.â€\\x9d Should Hillary Clinton defeat Trump, Democrats would need only four more Senate seats to take control through the vote wielded by the Senate president, Clinton vice-president Tim Kaine. The Republicansâ€™ House majority is stronger, but not safe. The can reveal that the casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who is said by well-placed sources to be worried about losing control of Congress, met Trump in New York last week. The donor, who one friend said has been â€œirked by a lot of thingsâ€\\x9d, had already met Trump privately at least twice this year. He has pushed for the candidate to visit Israel, which has not happened, and supported former House speaker Newt Gingrich for vice-president. Trump chose the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence. Earlier this summer, Adelson endorsed Trump, reportedly signaling that he was willing to spend up to $100m on the presidential contest. To date, however, he has not given money to any Super Pac. Three fundraising sources with good ties to Adelson said he is focused on trying to keep control of Congress, though he could donate to Trump if his gaffes are eliminated and his poll numbers improve. â€œIâ€™m shocked that Adelson has not done anything yet for Trump,â€\\x9d a senior GOP operative told the . â€œSheldon knows that late money is wasted.â€\\x9d While in New York, Adelson also met the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham. The two men, who share a sharply pro-Israel stance, discussed the financial needs of senators in tough races. Two other GOP operatives familiar with Adelson told the he had given $10m to One Nation, a group run by Steven Law, once a top aide to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. A â€œdark moneyâ€\\x9d group, legally able to keep its donors secret, One Nation was launched in May 2015. This year it has spent at least $16m on ads in several Senate races. Asked if Adelson had given $10m, Law said â€œwe donâ€™t commentâ€\\x9d on donors. Asked if the group or two others of which he is president â€“ American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS â€“ would get involved in the presidential election at all, he said: â€œWeâ€™re keeping our options open.â€\\x9d In 2012, groups backed by the Koch brothers and American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, both of which were co-founded by former Bush adviser Karl Rove, focused heavily on the presidential race, spending more than $200m. Adelson and his wife gave $23m to American Crossroads. In 2016, Koch network leaders have said they do not intend to get involved and Rove has been sharply critical of Trump, writing in the Wall Street Journal that he has been â€œgraceless and divisiveâ€\\x9d. Several groups are pouring millions into TV spots and get-out-the-vote drives in Senate races in states including Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Nevada and North Carolina. The US Chamber of Commerce has run ads in eight states as part of â€œSave the Senateâ€\\x9d, a drive it launched in May, its earliest ad foray in a presidential year. â€œI think the most productive way of using our money right now is for the Senate and House elections,â€\\x9d said Michael Epstein, a Maryland executive who has helped raise money for the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. â€œWinning the Senate would be a terrific victory and help rebuild the GOP brand. But itâ€™s going to be a tough struggle.â€\\x9d Many donors and fundraisers worry that a heavy Trump defeat could wreak havoc on Republican representatives and senators. â€œIf the guy at the top of the ticket is going to lose by double digits itâ€™s a cause of concern,â€\\x9d said former Minnesota senator Norm Coleman, who helps steer the American Action Network, a dark money group, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Super Pac that must disclose its donors. Colemanâ€™s fears seemed to increase after the Trump campaign shake-up that led to Steve Bannon, the chairman of Breitbart News, becoming chief executive. In response, Coleman tweeted that Trump was â€œreally dialing in his 38%â€\\x9d â€“ a reference to his base support among Republican voters â€“ â€œand saying to heck with down ballot Rsâ€\\x9d. This week, the Congressional Leadership Fund unveiled a $10m ad buy to support House members in a dozen key races. Even some old friends of Trump seem to have soured. In May, the casino tycoon Steve Wynn, arranged a meeting for Trump and Rove at his own New York residence. According to a GOP operative briefed on the meeting, Wynn was disappointed Trump â€œdidnâ€™t listen to Roveâ€™s adviceâ€\\x9d. Earlier this month, Wynn said he would stay out of the presidential race.',\n",
              "  \"Calls for UK to rejoin EU 'should be treason', urges Tory petition A Conservative councillor from Surrey has been suspended after launched a petition calling for Victorian-era legislation to be amended to make supporting UK membership of the EU a treasonable offence. Christian Holliday added the petition to the UK Government and Parliament website, and it calls for: The Treason Felony Act be amended to include the following offences: â€˜To imagine, devise, promote, work, or encourage others, to support UK becoming a member of the European Union; To conspire with foreign powers to make the UK, or part of the UK, become a member of the EU.â€™ The petition appears more designed to get a reaction from â€œremoanersâ€\\x9d than actually force a change in the law, and when this article was originally posted had only attracted 98 signatures, although media exposure had driven this up to more than 2,500 by Monday evening. Intended to come into force on the day of the UKâ€™s exit from the EU, it would outlaw any campaigning for a return. At 10,000 signatures, the government promises to respond to petitions on the site, and at 100,000 signatures, petitions are considered for debate in parliament. The petition goes on to say: It is becoming clear that many politicians and others are unwilling to accept the democratic decision of the British people to leave the EU. Brexit must not be put at risk in the years and decades ahead. For this reason we the undersigned request that the Treason Felony Act be amended as set out in this petition. The petition is among several on the site from leave campaigners. A call for â€œAll European Union flags, emblems and logos to be removed from all public buildingsâ€\\x9d attracted nearly 20,000 signatures, as has an appeal â€œNot to allow freedom of movement as part of any deal with the EU after Brexit.â€\\x9d The most signed petition about the EU though was a call for â€œHM government to implement a rule that if the remain or leave vote is less than 60% based on a turnout of less than 75% there should be another referendumâ€\\x9d. Even if Hollidayâ€™s changes were to be made, the chances of a successful prosecution seem thin. The act dates from 1848, but has not been used in a prosecution since 1879.

              "  'Tory MPs call for shift in farming subsidies to green protections Dozens of Conservative MPs have written to the prime minister, Theresa May, urging her to shift billions of pounds of post-Brexit farm subsidies towards protecting and improving the environment. The 36 MPs, including former environment ministers, also urge May to maintain the strong protection for wildlife and water provided by EU directives. During the EU referendum campaign, farming minister George Eustice campaigned for the leave camp and said the directives were â€œspirit-crushingâ€\\x9d and â€œwould goâ€\\x9d. UK farmers receive about Â£3bn a year via the EUâ€™s common agricultural policy (CAP), much of it for simply owning land. The Tory MPs want May to â€œtake advantage of the repatriation of CAP by shifting subsidies in favour of paying farmers for delivering services for the environment and public goodâ€\\x9d. The development of a new subsidy scheme is seen as one of the most difficult post-Brexit challenges and is now the responsibility of the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, a prominent leave campaigner. In August, the National Trust, a major landowner, called for complete reform of the British farm subsidy system to only reward farmers who improve the environment and help wildlife. The National Farmers Union criticised the plan, saying food production is vital. In July, a large group of 84 political and civil society organisations said post-Brexit subsidies paid to farmers must be linked closely to environmental responsibilities. The Tory MPs who signed the letter include former environment ministers Caroline Spelman and Richard Benyon, the current chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, Neil Parish, and Zac Goldsmith, member of the environmental audit select committee. â€œDone properly, Brexit is a massive opportunity for our environment,â€\\x9d said Goldsmith. â€œWe are urging the PM to put existing EU environmental protections into British law and to honour the green manifesto commitments we made before the election in full. But more than that, Brexit allows us to repatriate and reform the environmentally disastrous CAP to make sure farm subsidies are there to pay for environmental and public services. The upside is enormous.â€\\x9d An overwhelming majority of the British public wants new post-Brexit laws protecting wildlife and the countryside to be at least as strong as the EU rules currently in place, according to a national opinion poll published in August. Since she became prime minister, Mayâ€™s government has banned polluting plastic microbeads from some personal hygiene products but also expanded the controversial badger cull, which leading experts say â€œflies in the face of scientific evidenceâ€\\x9d. It has also backed direct compensation to people in areas affected by fracking and abolished the Department of Energy and Climate Change, with its responsibilities taken up by an enlarged business department. On Monday, Labour offered to work across party lines to enable the UK to rapidly follow the lead of the US and China in agreeing to ratify the Paris agreement on climate change. The Tory MPsâ€™ letter emphasises the green achievements of previous Conservative governments, including the Clean Air Act in 1956, the creation of the environment department in 1970 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act in 1981. â€œIntegral to Conservative philosophy is a deep cultural commitment to handing on a better world to our children,â€\\x9d it says. â€œLady Margaret Thatcher was always clear that we hold the earth on a full repairing lease,â€\\x9d said Sam Barker, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which co-ordinated the letter. â€œTheresa May will have a similarly bold vision for how Britain will fulfil the terms of that lease, at home and around the world. We look forward to her setting it out in due course.â€\\x9d The Tory MPs also urge May to â€œreaffirm our manifesto commitment to creating a blue belt of protected waters around the UKâ€™s 14 Overseas Territories, including as a first step around the Pitcairn Islands and Ascension Islandâ€\\x9d. The letter says this would â€œamount to the single biggest conservation measure of any government, everâ€\\x9d. The Conservative MPs who signed the letter are: Zac Goldsmith, Richard Benyon, Alex Chalk, Andrew Mitchell, Anne Main, Ben Howlett, Bernard Jenkin, Caroline Spelman, Charlotte Leslie, Cheryl Gillan, David Warburton, Derek Thomas, Flick Drummond, Heidi Allen, James Gray, Jason McCartney, Jeremy Lefroy, Jo Churchill, Kevin Hollinrake, Kit Malthouse, Marcus Fysh, Maria Caulfield, Matthew Offord, Neil Carmichael, Neil Parish, Nicolas Soames, Oliver Colvile, Paul Scully, Peter Bottomley, Richard Graham, Sarah Wollaston, Scott Mann, Stephen Hammond, Tania Mathias, Victoria Borwick, Will Quince.',\n",
              "  'The Fall review â€“ a long-running feud in every sense This somewhat thin documentary revisits a story of athletic rivalry that marked the careers of two runners and in some ways overshadowed their other achievements. The reigning queen of the track, the American Mary Decker had yet to win an Olympic medal. Her main challenger was Zola Budd, a teenage South African who ran barefoot and was raised on a farm. The press scented a story and, after Budd was controversially granted British citizenship in order to compete in the 1984 Olympic Games, did everything it could to stir up tension between them. Disaster struck when the pair collided and Decker fell, later blaming Budd for the incident. In fact, the film argues, the media had most cause to feel guilty.

              "  'More babies face health risks due to obese parents, experts warn A growing number of babies worldwide are at risk of brain damage or having a stroke, heart attack or asthma in adulthood because their mother was obese, health experts have warned. Leading doctors said dangerously overweight mothers were passing on obesity to their children as the result of â€œa vicious cycleâ€\\x9d in which excess weight can seriously affect the health of parents and their offspring. Four studies published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology make clear that the risks of maternal obesity include stillbirth, dangerously high blood pressure in pregnant women, diabetes in the mother or child, and complications during childbirth. The scale of obesity in women of childbearing age and the consequent dangers to health were so great that urgent action was needed to ensure women were a normal weight before they conceived, the authors say. Mothers being very heavily overweight could lead to their children having autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or developing cancer in later life, the researchers say. British women have the highest rates of obesity in Europe. One in five women in the UK who became pregnant were already obese, while in England, 26% of 35- to 44-year-old women were obese in 2013, as were 18% of those aged 24-35. Rates are even higher elsewhere. In the United States, 32% of women of peak childbearing age, between 20 and 39, were obese in 2011-12, and 60% of American women were either overweight or obese when they conceived, according to one study. Prof Lesley Regan, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which represents 14,000 doctors working in Britain and worldwide who specialise in childbirth and womenâ€™s health, said: â€œObesity has reached pandemic proportions globally and its origins start in the womb. In the UK, the prevalence of obesity is over 25% in both women and men. Around one in five pregnant women are obese, increasing their risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death as well as gestational diabetes, blood clots, pre-eclampsia, more complicated labours and severe bleeding after the birth.â€\\x9d The international team of experts behind the studies said they feared that the problem, which is worst in developed countries, would escalate further because one in five (21%) women in the world are projected to be dangerously overweight by 2025. One of the research papers, which have reviewed hundreds of previous obesity studies, warned: â€œThe long-term effects of maternal obesity could have profound public health implications.â€\\x9d Another concluded that maternal obesity was spreading so fast, especially in western countries, that governments should start treating it as a global public health priority. One of the research reviews, led by Prof Keith Godfrey of Southampton University, detailed the range of serious health problems that excess maternal weight could have on a child and pointed out that fathersâ€™ weight could also increase the risks. â€œIncreasing evidence implicates maternal obesity as a major determinant of offspring health during childhood and later adult life,â€\\x9d the review states, adding that it heightened the childâ€™s risk of obesity, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and asthma. Maternal obesity could also lead to poorer cognitive performance and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including cerebral palsy. An unborn childâ€™s brain could be damaged because â€œobesity in pregnancy is associated with complex neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and inflammatory changes, which probably affect foetal hormonal exposure and nutrient supply,â€\\x9d Godfreyâ€™s paper explains. The key lies in â€œepigenetic processes by which aspects of parental (both motherâ€™s and fatherâ€™s) lifestyle can affect the way the babyâ€™s genes operate during development. These can change the personâ€™s responses to the challenges of, for example, living in an â€˜obesogenicâ€™ environment,â€\\x9d it adds. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises women who may become pregnant to eat healthily, exercise for at least 30 minutes a day and try to maintain a healthy weight. Each obese woman who gave birth in Britain cost the NHS Â£500 to Â£1,000 more than a mother of a normal weight, said Prof Rebecca Reynolds, of Edinburgh University. However, the authors drew few firm conclusions in their search for ways to address and prevent maternal obesity and found limited evidence that specific interventions were effective. â€œWe know that there are going to be more and more obese people in years to come, so there will be passage of obesity from one generation to the next, even though no parent who is obese wants their child to suffer from it too,â€\\x9d said Prof Mark Hanson, of Southampton University, another co-author. He recommended that overweight women be given more information and guidance from health professionals before they conceived or after they had given birth to help them lose weight, especially before they had any more children. Bariatric surgery undertaken before an obese woman conceived could benefit both her and her babyâ€™s health, the authors found, though anyone who has the operation should wait for up to 18 months afterwards before giving birth. â€œWomen who are overweight when entering pregnancy or who gain excess weight during pregnancy may well establish an inter-generational amplification of the obesity epidemic,â€\\x9d said Dr Tim Lobstein, director of policy at the World Obesity Federation. â€œThere is international agreement at United Nations level to halt the rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes across the globe. However, turning an ambitious target into practical action is proving elusive. â€œThere are well-recognised but well-embedded systemic problems to resolve, such as the increasingly commercialised food supply, the dominance of motorised transport, the development of dense and hazardous urban environments, or the enticements of sedentary screen-watching,â€\\x9d he said.',\n",
              "  'MP calls for Green Investment Bank safeguards before privatisation The head of a parliamentary committee is to demand ministers introduce tougher safeguards to ensure the Green Investment Bank continues with its low-carbon mandate following a controversial privatisation. Mary Creagh MP, who chairs the environmental audit committee (EAC), also expressed concern that the bank could in future put more effort into overseas projects than in supporting the domestic sector for which it was set up. The government has said it will retain a special share in the lending institution. It insists this will prevent new owners deviating from the core task of funding renewable energy projects that are deemed at risk by traditional lenders. But in a letter to the before the debate on the sale of the bank in the House of Commons, Creagh writes: â€œI welcome the secretary of stateâ€™s pledge to protect the bankâ€™s green status with a special share, as my committee recommended, but I am concerned that without locking this in legislation it may not be secure. â€œI will be supporting amendments to that effect when the sale is debated in the Commons this week. If the government cannot guarantee that the Green Investment Bank will continue to invest in smart, energy-efficient, low-carbon projects, then the sale should not go ahead.â€\\x9d The Labour MP added that she would also be demanding that the government write in a requirement to the sale document that the senior executives continue to give details of their pay and conditions to parliament. â€œToo often in the past we have seen privatised companies bumping up executive bonuses and incentives on the back of better financial results produced by stripping out the head count,â€\\x9d she writes. Concern has been raised by the green lender admitting it has already been approached by potential buyers from the private equity, sovereign wealth and private investment bank sectors. Creagh also said she was alarmed that Shaun Kingsbury, the chief executive of the bank, had already indicated he wanted to expand into places such as Germany, the Netherlands and India. This would take the bank away from its original purpose, to accelerate a move towards a low carbon economy, she added. The bank has so far put Â£2.6bn of public money into British low-carbon projects, although it is involved in Â£200m international joint venture with the Department of Energy & Climate Change. Lord Smith of Kelvin, who chairs the bank, has argued that privatising the group would allow it to raise money from other investors and widen the scope of its investments in the UK.',\n",

An abiding mood of frustration, knowing that our competitors are unlikely EVER to offer us a better opportunity to bring home the Premier League bacon. Weâ€™re torn between the faint hope of the very worthy Foxes faltering and the possibility of them leaving the door open, only for the unthinkable consequence of Spurs charging through it. How is the manager doing? Although itâ€™s hard to envisage a last-ditch title tilt, at long last ArsÃ¨ne appears to have chanced upon a more balanced looking side and if we should finally produce the consistency to finish above Spurs, I wonder if this will be sufficient to get so many of those who have lost faith in him back on side? Which players have been shining lights? For their unsung consistency, Monreal, Koscielny and BellerÃ\\xadn. Yet of late itâ€™s been the homegrown Iwobi and the bargain buy Elneny creating a spark of optimism. Which players have left you unimpressed? Theo Walcott is an extremely likeable lad but most Gooners have lost patience. Thereâ€™s also great disappointment that Ramsey and SÃ¡nchez have failed to reproduce their feats from last term.

It has switched from fury to apathy to mild optimism about what a new, promotion-specialist manager could do over the next two years. The new boardroom broom has started well (only Garde to go), but the choice of new boss is the biggest test. My sense is that Moyes is the preferred choice with Pearson, Pulis and Rodgers in the â€œtheyâ€™ll doâ€\\x9d camp. The alleged deep football thinkers will doubtless baulk at the unoriginality, but pragmatism is required. Manager? Hopefully it will be a caretaker by the time this is printed â€¦ Sadly, Garde never gave any sign of possessing the coaching ability, the tactical nous or the mental toughness required. Goodbye rather than au revoir. Shining lights? Gueye has improved since it became clear he needed a new club. That the rest havenâ€™t shows they were hopeless in the first place and not simply shirking. Ayew is our best player by far. Unimpressed? Guzan is an easy target and has lost his confidence. If Richards was as good as he thinks he is, weâ€™d have stayed up. His inane, self-publicising social media ramblings are nearly in Lescottâ€™s class.

They are all stars, to be honest, but the return of Max Gradel was significant and the most consistent player has been Charlie Daniels. Unimpressed? I suppose I find Glenn Murrayâ€™s signing a strange one. While he has scored a few goals he does not really fit into the way the team plays. I canâ€™t knock his effort, though. Finish?

Hiddink Mk 2 isnâ€™t half as effective as Hiddink Mk 1. He seems to set up teams to not lose rather than win. The football is dull and the points haul isnâ€™t much better than the beginning of the season under Mourinho. The players know that heâ€™s not the one they need to impress. Shining lights?

We are in the fourth FA Cup semi-final in our history and seven points clear of relegation with eight games left. And yet, we have not won in the league since 19 December, have the worst league record in the top four divisions in 2016 and have equalled our worst run of home defeats in our history (six). The fans are looking forward to Wembley, but opinions on Alan Pardew are becoming split. A win against Norwich on 9 April is a must to put any fears of relegation to bed. Manager? You can see that the pressure is getting to Pardew now and his outburst against Jamie Carragher in his recent programme notes was telling. He has no excuse with injuries now as Wickham and McArthur apart we have a fully fit squad. There seems to be no plan B to stop this disastrous run. Even if we stay up the fear is we will tailspin straight into the next campaign. Shining lights? Wilfried Zaha continues to deliver and Bolasie is starting to get back towards his pre-injury form. Wickham had a hit a brilliant level of form but then got injured, which sums up Palaceâ€™s season. Unimpressed? Pape SouarÃ©â€™s form has taken an alarming dip.

But disappointed to be below mid-table with only five wins at Goodison. Too many games have been lost from winning positions. Manager? Iâ€™m still with Roberto, but Iâ€™ll give him until the end of the season. He needs to learn how to hold on to winning positions. Weâ€™ve dropped too many points, especially at home. Some bad substitute decisions have lost us games. Shining lights? Without a doubt Lukaku has been outstanding, breaking records with his goalscoring. Ross Barkley has matured and added goals to his game and Aaron Lennon has surprised me with his constantly good performances, taking over from Gerard Deulofeu who was outstanding at the beginning of the season.

Unadulterated jubilation, unsurprisingly. Perhaps, the nerves are starting to set in now weâ€™re in the home straight but nothing can dampen our spirits at the moment. Manager? Heâ€™s the leagueâ€™s best on current form. We were mocked for appointing Ranieri off the back of his tenure as Greeceâ€™s boss, but heâ€™s done a sterling job for us and deserves every bit of praise going. Shining lights? Obviously Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy are the stand-out players but Iâ€™m vehement in my belief that Nâ€™Golo KantÃ© has been the clubâ€™s best player this term. His consistency defies belief. However, the whole squad has virtually been at the top of their game all season; Morgan and Drinkwater deserve plaudits for their marked improvements this year. Unimpressed? Itâ€™s hard to single any one player out. Ulloa has not played as well as he did last season but heâ€™s still contributing with crucial goals here and there. GÃ¶khan Inler has come in for some criticism too but given his lack of opportunity to break in to such an imperious midfield, I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m â€œunimpressedâ€\\x9d by him. Finish?

Despondent. Despite our good form in the cups, our league form has been woeful â€“ we havenâ€™t won back-to-back matches since October and have managed 36 points from our past 25 league games. The club should be embarrassed given its resources. The mood took a further hit with the decision to charge up to Â£60 a ticket for the Champions League quarter-final with PSG. Ticket-pricing is, rightly, coming in for a lot of criticism. Manager? Struggled this season. Despite the successes of his first campaign, ultimately, the team has regressed. I like Pellegrini as a man but itâ€™s stale football under stale management. The decision to announce Pep Guardiolaâ€™s arrival on 1 February has evidently backfired too, as thereâ€™s a real possibility of the Europa League next season. Shining lights? Bacary Sagna, Fernandinho and Joe Hart have been excellent. Coincidentally, theyâ€™re also our top three appearance-makers this season. Kelechi Iheanacho is an absolute star in the making.

We expected improvement but instead weâ€™re worse this season than we were last. However, Louis van Gaal can still lead us to a top-four position and a trip to Wembley - though both are far from a given. Manager?

He has been handicapped by a dreadful run of injuries but poor performances, particularly mid-season, the awful exit from the Champions League, the inability to beat a poor Liverpool side over two legs in the Europa League and the continuing erratic results in the league probably mean he wonâ€™t be in charge come August. Shining lights? David de Gea continues to perform to the highest standards. Anthony Martial is a wonderful talent and hopefully will become a United legend, and the introduction of Marcus Rashford has given us something to look forward to. Unimpressed?

              "  'Bank of Cyprus to list on London Stock Exchange Bank of Cyprus is to list on the London Stock Exchange and expand in the UK, in the latest sign of its path towards rehabilitation since savers were forced to take losses to pump billions of euros into its bailout three years ago. Under John Hourican, a former senior executive at Royal Bank of Scotland who left during the Libor rigging crisis, Bank of Cyprus has undergone a radical restructuring and repaid all but â‚¬800m (Â£690m) of â‚¬11.4bn emergency liquidity assistance used to keep it afloat at the peak of the islandâ€™s economic meltdown. The Mediterranean island was at the heart of the eurozone crisis in 2013 when a rescue deal for Bank of Cyprus â€“ its biggest lender â€“ was a key part of measures need to keep the country inside the single currency area. Laiki, or Cyprus Popular Bank, was closed and its smaller depositors placed in Bank of Cyprus, which in turn imposed losses on savers holding deposits more than â‚¬100,000, many of whom were said to be Russian. It was first bank in the eurozone to take a slice of customersâ€™ savings as part of the international â‚¬10bn bailout of the island to avoid recourse to taxpayers. Hourican, who is Irish, tried to leave last year but was convinced to stay on by veteran banker Josef Ackermann, who became chairman of Bank of Cyprus in 2014 when it received a capital injection from a group international investors led by private equity billionaire Wilbur Ross. Ackermann is a former chief executive of Deutsche Bank, itself mired in financial difficulties. An attempt at a London listing is a high-profile move for Hourican, who told parliamentarians after the RBS Â£290m Libor fine that he had told colleagues â€œthey should not waste my deathâ€\\x9d and clean up the culture of the bank. He was described by Andrew Tyrie MP as a â€œhuman shieldâ€\\x9d for others at RBS. Hourican has sold off Bank of Cyprusâ€™s Russian arm and scaled back its other international operations but intends to expand in the UK, where there already four branches. The aim is to target the professional buy-to-let market and small business customers, entrepreneurs and Cypriots living in the UK. The London-based arm is covered by the UK deposit scheme, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which covers the first Â£75,000 of savings. To facilitate the listing in London â€“ through which Bank of Cyprus does not intend to raise fresh funds â€“ a holding company will be set up in Ireland so that it meets the standards to allow it to be included in the FTSE series of stock market indices. It will remain listed in Cyprus but delist from Athens. At the time of the bankâ€™s half-year results in August, Hourican described in a Bloomberg interview how the bank and the country had experienced a â€œsignificant cardiac arrestâ€\\x9d when he took over. As the bank reported â‚¬120m on pre-tax profits for the first nine months of 2016, Hourican said customer deposits had increased 10%. â€œWe remain focused on operating as an accelerator for growth in the real Cypriot economy,â€\\x9d he said.',\n",

We know when heâ€™s been for a coffee, had the painters in, what the patio is looking like, how the grass is growing, if his football team has scored and if the catâ€™s had a funny turn. OK over a pint in the pub: but it is all getting too close to work for comfort. First weâ€™ve had the Twitter digs obviously aimed at us.

              "  'Harry Rabinowitz obituary For half a century the orchestral conductor and composer Harry Rabinowitz, who has died aged 100, played a key role in the British broadcasting and film industries. He was in charge of popular and light music for both the BBC and London Weekend Television and conducted the music for more than 60 films. Rabinowitz often said that he never wished to â€œwaste his colleaguesâ€™ timeâ€\\x9d and was opposed to over-rehearsing. Although he was highly professional, he was not a dictatorial conductor, telling an interviewer that â€œin almost all the sessions Iâ€™ve conducted, the musicians have left smilingâ€\\x9d. Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Israel and Eva, he went to Athlone high school and the University of the Witwatersrand, where he studied the piano and composition. He was fired from his first job, as a jewellery salesman, after only one day and next found work demonstrating new songs to customers in the sheet music department of a Johannesburg store. Following a period in the South African army during the second world war, he conducted the orchestra for the musical Strike a New Note before travelling to London in 1946 to take up a place on the conducting course at the Guildhall School of Music. With the help of the actor and comedian Sid James, a fellow South African, Rabinowitz found his feet in the British music business. He played the piano for the popular BBC radio show Variety Band- box and was a session musician at EMIâ€™s Abbey Road recording studios. His conducting career began in earnest when he was hired to work on the musical Golden City in 1950. Written by Philip Tore, the show was set in the South African gold rush of 1886. This led to work at seasonal ice shows at the Empress Hall in Earlâ€™s Court, London, and, in 1953, as musical director of the London production of Lerner and Loeweâ€™s Broadway hit Paint Your Wagon. Next, Rabinowitz was offered a contract to conduct the BBC Revue Orchestra. This was a house band of the Light Programme and could be heard on such shows as Variety Playhouse, Henry Hallâ€™s Guest Night and the Jimmy Edwards comedy series Take It From Here. He could also be heard as a pianist on Midday Music Hall and Piano Playtime. In 1960, Rabinowitz was appointed music director of BBC TV light entertainment, at a time when variety and comedy shows requiring orchestral accompaniment dominated the schedules. In addition to conducting the orchestra for the Val Doonican Show, Peter Cook and Dudley Mooreâ€™s Not Only... But Also and many others, he composed music for The Frost Report (1966). Rabinowitz then moved to a similar post at the newly established London Weekend Television (1968-77). There he worked on Upstairs, Downstairs (1971) and Black Beauty (1972). His theme music for Love for Lydia (1977) was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. By now, his reputation as a conductor and arranger of popular and light music was sufficiently high for him to pursue a freelance career in theatre, films and broadcasting, where he went on to compose music for the TV series the Agatha Christie Hour (1982) and Reilly: Ace of Spies (1983). In the theatre, Rabinowitz conducted the orchestra at the premiere of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and TS Eliot musical Cats (1981) and Don Black and Lloyd Webberâ€™s Song and Dance the following year. He was in even greater demand to work in films, in one year (1991) recording music for nine movies. His cinema credits included Chariots of Fire (1981), The Remains of the Day (1993), Howards End (1992), The English Patient (1996) and The Talented Mr Ripley (1999). His final film score assignment, at the age of 87, was Cold Mountain (2003). Rabinowitzâ€™s renown as a conductor of film and light music spread to the US and led to seven seasonsâ€™ work as guest conductor with the Boston Pops Orchestra, beginning in 1985. He also appeared at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1980s, as well as occasional concerts with the London Symphony and Royal Philharmonic Orchestras. In 1996, he conducted a concert at Carnegie Hall, New York, of music from the films of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory. He was appointed MBE in 1977 and in 1985 received the Gold Badge of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Last year Rabinowitz became one of the oldest guests on Desert Island Discs at the age of 99, choosing a pitch pipe as his luxury item. In recent years, Rabinowitz divided his time between Provence and Portland, Oregon, the home town of his second wife, Mitzi Scott, whom he married in 2001. She survives him, as do three children, Karen, Simon and Lisa, from his first marriage, to Lorna Anderson, which ended in divorce, and four grandchildren. â€¢ Harry Rabinowitz, conductor and composer, born 26 March 1916; died 22 June 2016 â€¢ This article was amended on 24 June 2016. Harry Rabinowitz died on 22 June, not 21 June, as originally stated. His children are Karen, Simon and Lisa, rather than Karen, Simon and Oliver.',\n",
              "  \"The Comedian's Guide to Survival review â€“ heard the one about the unfunny standup? This British effort about menâ€™s magazine journalist James Mullinger (James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who wants to be a standup comic at least deserves some credit for daring to make it hard for itself. After all, how does one make a comedy with a protagonist whose defining feature is that heâ€™s not very funny? Director Mark Murphy, working with a semi-autobiographical script by him and journo-turned-joker James Mullinger, tries to solve the problem by surrounding his lead with proper comedians whom James meets or interviews about the secrets of standup. Omid Djalili, Jimmy Carr, and Gilbert Gottfried consequently all play either themselves or variations thereof, while Paul Kaye and Vas Blackwood take on more substantial roles as the lead characterâ€™s magazine-editor boss and a famous success story, respectively. Unfortunately, the gambit only works up to a certain point, since clearly no one is using their best material, and Lord knows the lead characterâ€™s patter, about standup sex toys at garage sales and how horrible his boss is, represents an embarrassment. Please, donâ€™t stand up on our account.\",\n",
              "  'Louis van Gaal: Manchester United fans were right to boo at Southampton loss Louis van Gaal admitted Manchester Unitedâ€™s fans were right to boo him during Saturdayâ€™s 1-0 home defeat to Southampton in the first sign of open revolt since the Dutchman arrived as manager at Old Trafford but refused to say whether he fears for his job. Charlie Austinâ€™s 87th-minute header on his debut for the visitors consigned United to a first defeat in six games. It widened the gap to Tottenham Hotspur in fourth place to five points after the London clubâ€™s 3-1 win at Crystal Palace. It also posed questions about Van Gaalâ€™s position. â€œI cannot answer. It is not for me to answer these kinds of questions,â€\\x9d said Van Gaal. Supporters jeered the side during another insipid United display. At the final whistle they booed Van Gaal loudly as he walked to the tunnel. â€œYou cannot say that they [fans] are not right,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThey are right and of course they are disappointed and they have the right to boo me. You know it was not good today. It was a poor game and we could not create chances and our opponent also had a few chances. So itâ€™s more or less a 0-0 game. But at the end we have lost.â€\\x9d Asked if this was the poorest display of a tenure that began in summer 2014, Van Gaal said: â€œI donâ€™t know but it was a poor performance because football is not only defending but also creating chances and we didnâ€™t create any chances. Our opponent denied that so it was a poor game for the fans. I can imagine that.I am disappointed but I have to think and already I put the question how I can change this because we have to change this. That is my job and it is not an easy job at the moment. Nevertheless we have won three times in 2016 and a draw so very good results in January â€“ but we could not show it in this game. I did not see that confidence today.â€\\x9d Van Gaal does not believe the transfer window can change things. â€œOne player cannot change everything. Sometimes it looks like it but it is always the process of team-building what makes a team stronger but sometimes one individual can give the first stimulus for that process but it is not so easy as you say or ask.â€\\x9d Matteo Darmian became the latest defender to be ruled out when suffering a suspected injured rib in the second half. Van Gaal said: â€œHe was spitting blood on the pitch so he has already gone to the hospital and we have to wait and see what happens. That is the fifth full-back who has been injured so that is what I have to do also to make solutions to solve the problems. Probably one rib and also the chest is something wrong but we have to wait and see.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Iâ€™m getting over my post-Brexit meltdown For me, the first sign of recovery from post-Brexit shock was the sudden and unexpected return of my sense of humour and perspective. It started when I progressed to not feeling quite such an urge to plead with people to sign endless online petitions, which, at any rate, were becoming so numerous that they were in grave danger of outnumbering the 48% of Remainers who were signing them. My petition Touretteâ€™s under control, it was time to slap my own face several times to get rid of any lingering â€œdual nationalityâ€\\x9d fantasies. My insomnia has improved too â€“ I only wake to see Boris Johnsonâ€™s face appearing in the pattern on the bedroom curtains a few times a night now. Sadly, the nocturnal visions of a tiny, capering Nigel Farage are still going strongâ€¦ Some of the above â€“ endless petitions, insomniaâ€“ you might have experienced yourself, while other parts â€“ visions of Farage and Johnson â€“ with luck, you havenâ€™t. Fact is, I crumbled post-Brexit. While others got to work (a magazine called the New European was created and published within a week), I came to typify the archetypal, foot-stamping, ineffectual Remain casualty, a veritable Violet Elizabeth Bott of the handwringing liberal echo chamber. I have no excuse for this. I suppose it was just the shock of feeling that Iâ€™d gone to sleep in one country and woken up in another. All those signifiers, big and small, that something important had been broken and something ugly was gaining strength got to me. Marine Le Pen gloating at the result. The 3,000 new hate crimes in England and Wales. The pound plummeting like a reckless tombstoner â€“ youâ€™ve all seen the news. Now that the â€œliberal panicâ€\\x9d is settling, the Leave camp has some explaining to do â€“ if we could find any of them. Theyâ€™ve been vanishing one by one, as though in some surreal Agatha Christie whodunnit (from what I can make out, Liz Hurley is in charge now). Has anyone concocted a Leave plan yet or is it still: â€œWeâ€™re taking our country back â€“ and fingers crossed we can be Norwayâ€\\x9d? The only point Iâ€™ve seen Leavers make with any fervour is that Remainers should stop being â€œsore losersâ€\\x9d and accept democracy. Would that be the same kind of â€œsore loserâ€\\x9d that Farage said heâ€™d be if Leave lost by a similar minuscule margin? Is democracy now defined by the many Leave voters regretting their â€œprotest voteâ€\\x9d, realising that they were lied to by squabbling politicians? Despite everything, I refuse to believe that the provincial working class, the kind of people I grew up among, are either stupid or racist. Not only were Leave voters brazenly (unlawfully) lied to, they were also abandoned to their fate by an opposition party that should have been robustly campaigning and informing, rather than what amounted to strategic ineffectiveness. The same Labour party that is led by a man who at best comes across as a sparkly eyed competition winner who canâ€™t quite believe all the attention heâ€™s getting (and doesnâ€™t look like volunteering to return to backbench obscurity just yet). Shame on Jeremy Corbyn for enabling this shoddy, contaminated Brexit â€“ for me, this amounts to yet another last straw. Indeed, embarrassed though I am by my post-Brexit meltdown, I feel positively chipper now, so much so that, like many others Iâ€™ve spoken to, Iâ€™m considering giving my vote, perhaps even membership fees, to the party (Liberal Democrats?) most committed to finding a way out of this mess. Looking back on this tumultuous fortnight, I canâ€™t help but feel that people like me might not have felt so â€œlostâ€\\x9d had we believed that our views were being politically represented. Less bull about Pamplonaâ€™s bull run, please Five people were gored during the yearly running of the bulls at Pamplonaâ€™s San Fermin festival. Please forgive me, but, just for a split second, a part of me thought: â€œGood.â€\\x9d Of course it isnâ€™t good (may the injured make swift recoveries). However, the Pamplona bull run is a cruel, disgusting custom that deeply shames its host nation every year. Popularised by Ernest Hemingway, itâ€™s become a test of machismo for men who ironically seem too dumb to have read The Sun Also Rises. Others blather about tradition, but who has the patience for tradition where animal cruelty is concerned? Britain used to have bearbaiting and cockfighting. Anyone fancy getting those charming, folksy pastimes back? A good rule of thumb with such matters is to ask: if a particular custom had completely died out, would a revival be permitted? If the answer is no, then why in any humane world should it continue? At a time when itâ€™s rumoured that foxhunting may be about to make a reappearance on the British political agenda, it seems important to know exactly where you stand on bloodsports and the â€œtraditionsâ€\\x9d that excuse them. Three-fifths of Girl Power? No thanks Emboldened by their 20th anniversary, the Spice Girls are planning another reunion jaunt. However, it looks as though they might be missing Mel Chisholm (undecided) and Victoria Beckham (very decidedâ€¦ against). Hence theyâ€™re said to be toying with the new name Gem, representing the initials of the remaining trio, Geri (Halliwell), Emma (Bunton) and Melanie (Brown). I would strongly advise against this. First, a change of moniker is unnecessary as many acts have re-formed with key personnel missing, as evidenced by the myriad ugly squabbles over rights to band names. Out of friendship, loyalty and decency (and perhaps just a teeny weeny bit of sheer boredom, laced with icy contempt), neither Beckham nor Chisholm seems interested in fighting the trio over the use of the name, so whatâ€™s the point of changing it? As the depleted Spice Girls (possible tagline for posters: â€œAt least one less with her microphone turned off by a discreet roadie!â€\\x9d), the band could at least hope to make a packet on the thriving retro-music circuit, and good luck to them. As Gem, with the same personnel, Iâ€™m not so sure. I even feel slightly afraid for them. As the Spice Girls, thereâ€™s exciting talk of a huge show in Hyde Park; as Gem, Iâ€™m envisioning tragic, increasingly desperate personal appearances, say, outside branches of Morrisons, with staff handing around paper plates of pork pies with union jack skewers in them (to echo Geriâ€™s famous dress) or, worse, some microwaved congealing Pop-Tarts (geddit?). This is the sort of thing that happens when a strong brand doesnâ€™t recognise its own value and inevitability. If the remaining Spices arenâ€™t careful, they could end up being wannabes to their own legacy.',\n",
              "  'An NHS tax? Osborne wonâ€™t like it, but the public will The NHS is one of our most cherished institutions. The Commonwealth Fund, a private American foundation that supports independent research on health, judged it to be overall the best, and easily the best value for money, of any national system of healthcare. Yet today it faces an existential crisis. Hospitals are running up huge deficits and their financial situation is deteriorating rapidly. A shortage of doctors has forced over a hundred GP surgeries to apply for the right to stop accepting patients. Morale among junior doctors is so low that they not only went on strike but many now feel they have to emigrate. As Polly Toynbee demonstrated in Tuesdayâ€™s , the NHS will need a large injection of new cash to make up for the gross neglect of mental health. Lack of cash lies at the heart of the NHS crisis, and the fundamental reason is that its costs rise much faster than the growth of GDP (or national income). We live longer, and the older we get the more medical care we need. New expensive drugs and surgical procedures cure diseases that were incurable before. And, making things worse, these extra costs have to be met at a time when George Osborneâ€™s declared strategy is to shrink the state and eliminate the national deficit by 2020. Social services, which play an essential role in providing healthcare, have already suffered grievously from cuts and are facing more. In fact instead of increasing as a proportion of GDP, the share of expenditure on health and social care is actually declining. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, it will decline from 6.1% in 2014/2025 to 5.4% in 2020/2021, as revealed by the Treasuryâ€™s own autumn spending review. What can we do to save the NHS? Either spending will have to be drastically increased, or costs drastically cut, or there will have to be further reorganisation, perhaps a mixture of all three. Norman Lamb MP, the former Liberal Democrat health minister, recently introduced a 10-minute rule motion in the House of Commons to set up an independent commission on the future of health and social care â€“ a kind of modern Beveridge commission. He is supported by two former secretaries of state for health â€“ the Conservative Stephen Dorrell and Labourâ€™s Alan Milburn, and by MPs from all three parties. Much as the commission is urgently needed, it will, unfortunately, take time to report. However, one crucially important part of Lambâ€™s proposal could be implemented by next year. It is to convert national insurance contributions (NICs) into a separate, progressive, hypothecated tax, earmarked solely for funding both health and social care, which cannot be treated separately. Unblocking the misuse of hospital beds, for instance, cannot be achieved without a joint approach. NICs no longer serve a useful purpose. Originally they were introduced to pay for the cost of health and pensions. Instead, they have become part of the governmentâ€™s general revenue, but they still survive as a separate, inefficient, retrogressive tax on jobs, which increases both business costs and unemployment. Whatever happens, they should be scrapped. However, the Treasury is strongly opposed to hypothecated taxes. General taxation, it is argued, is more efficient because it involves fewer transaction costs and is collected from the largest possible base. It is also claimed that hypothecation ties the Treasuryâ€™s hands because it hampers the most efficient allocation of public funds to where they are most needed or give best value for money. It has also been suggested that a hypothecated health tax would alter behaviour: â€œWe have paid for this service. We must get everything out of it we can.â€\\x9d Some of these arguments are not without merit. But in my view they are vastly outweighed by the special regard people have for the NHS. We are more willing, or much less unwilling, to pay for what we greatly value. Many people resent paying taxes because they donâ€™t like government policy, or some particular policies (spending on Trident, for instance, or what are perceived as excessive welfare benefits or bureaucratic waste). But a tax for a popular public service overcomes this objection. The most effective slogan of any recent Liberal Democrat election campaign was â€œAn extra penny on income tax for educationâ€\\x9d. The TV licence fee is a hypothecated tax. A poll commissioned by the BBC found that the licence fee was easily the least unpopular way of paying for the BBC. The great American judge Oliver Wendell Holmes once said: â€œTaxes are the price we pay for a civilised society.â€\\x9d A special health and social care tax could not be a better example.',\n",

The children of the rich are increasingly dominating the popular arts. The writers of the popular culture explosion of the late 50s and 60s came from the backgrounds that they wrote about, and its musicians, photographers and stylists grew up with one foot in the street and the other in art school. Even grammar school products like Mick Jagger were a bit of a rarity.

              "  \"Senior bitcoin developer says currency 'failed experiment' A senior bitcoin developer has declared the cryptocurrency a failed experiment, blaming the end of the currency on the refusal of the community to adopt new standards which would allow it to grow consistently while maintaining stability. Mike Hearn, a longtime senior developer on bitcoin and the former chair of the bitcoin foundationâ€™s law and policy committee, announced in a blogpost that he would be selling his coins and quitting development on the project. â€œDespite knowing that bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly,â€\\x9d he wrote. Hearnâ€™s objections to the current state of bitcoin are varied and frequently technical in nature, but at heart there are two failures: the section of the bitcoin community with power over the future of the currency is overly centralised and overly resistant to change. Hearn writes that: â€œWhat was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked â€˜systemically important institutionsâ€™ and â€˜too big to failâ€™ has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.â€\\x9d There are two important bottlenecks in bitcoinâ€™s organisational structure: the developers and the miners. The former group are those people with the authority to make changes to the released version of bitcoin (the â€œcoreâ€\\x9d). Although bitcoin is open source software, meaning anyone is free to use it or tweak it into a new system, there is still only one official release of it. Anyone can propose changes to that release, but only five people have the authority to actually put those changes into the released version â€“ and those five have been hopelessly split for the past six months about how to deal with bitcoinâ€™s capacity problems as it grows. The split has become so bad that Gavin Andresen, the most senior of the developers, paired with Hearn in August to attempt to launch a â€œhard forkâ€\\x9d of bitcoin, which would use the same basic code but fix some of the capacity constraints. That launch merely exacerbated the split, however, with people who supported the new version (dubbed bitcoin XT) being blacklisted by the supporters of the old version. But the main reason why XT never took off was the failure of the other major bottleneck: the miners. Bitcoin is supposed to be a decentralised currency. Anyone can download the entire history of bitcoin transactions, and devote computing power to verifying future transactions (called mining). For a change such as the switch to XT to succeed, more than half of the computing power on the bitcoin network has to support it by updating their own software accordingly. But very few people bother to mine for bitcoin. Itâ€™s expensive in terms of computer hardware, time and electricity so it is very difficult to beat professionally equipped outlets in the race for rewards. Those amateurs who do mine largely do so as part of pools, who share both computing power and rewards. Those pools, however, are also centrally controlled. As a result, Hearn points out, just two individuals control more than 50% of the power of the network. He adds that â€œover 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stageâ€\\x9d at a recent bitcoin conference. For their own reasons, the miners, who are largely based in China, are reluctant to switch to a competing implementation of bitcoin, or push for changes. As a result, Hearn writes, bitcoin is seeing ever greater congestion in the network, which it is unable to cope with in its present form. And the institutional failure to accept changes means that confidence in the currency is declining. â€œThe fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwardsâ€\\x9d, Hearn writes.\",\n",
              "  'Openreach decision is an upgrade for all â€“ as long as Ofcom gets sums right Has Sharon White at Ofcom flunked it by declining to order an immediate breakup of BT? No. The argument for liberating Openreach â€“ as advocated by Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk â€“ was always too full of wishful thinking. There are many reasons to bemoan BTâ€™s performance in broadband but abolishing one monopoly supplier to create another monopoly supplier would have achieved little in itself. An independent Openreach, loaded with a chunk of pension liabilities, might have chosen to sweat its old copper assets just as intensely as critics say BT does. Competition would not have been advanced one jot. Even more heavier-handed regulation might have been required to improve the UKâ€™s broadband infrastructure. White is sensibly retaining the breakup option and thus waving a weapon at BT chief executive Gavin Patterson to discourage foot-dragging. But, for now, the focus is on encouraging rivals to invest in competing fibre cables while injecting accountability into Openreach. It is a good, pragmatic choice. First, BT will have to allow rivals to build their own fibre networks by opening up Openreachâ€™s underground cable ducts and telegraph poles. Second, there will be heavier fines if Openreach misses service standards. Third, Openreach will have an independent board. The opening up of the infrastructure is the most important innovation. BT reacted by shrugging its shoulders and saying rivals have had that right since 2009 and few have bothered to use it. Ofcom counters that life will be different in future: fibre enthusiasts will enjoy easy access and lower costs and be allowed to make decent returns. Much depends on the regulator getting its sums right. But, if it has, there is the chance of a proper contest, to the benefit of consumers. Sky will no longer have to grumble that BT is wedding everyone to a â€œslow laneâ€\\x9d copper-based future. It will be able to exploit its rivalâ€™s lack of vision by betting on ultrafast fibre and scooping the winnings. Go for it. Ofcomâ€™s other two main prescriptions for Openreach will have to pass a real-world test. Penalties advertised as â€œsubstantialâ€\\x9d must bite. And the new armâ€™s-length governance set-up â€“ a separate board and investment budget â€“ must avoid the endless wrangling seen in the banking sector over ringfencing. But Ofcomâ€™s basic thinking is correct. More competition for Openreach, not a messy divorce from BT, sounds a quicker way to upgrade the countryâ€™s broadband. Paying dividend pays dividend for Lloyds bosses Itâ€™s easy to look pretty in todayâ€™s banking sector. All you have to do, it seems, is pay a dividend that investors can believe in. It worked for Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday as a Â£2bn distribution to shareholders was greeted with a 13% surge in the share price. The marketâ€™s excitement was odd because Lloyds did little more than it had previously pledged on dividends. Perhaps investors were worried that the Bank of England, at the 11th hour and amid the Brexit brouhaha, would insist that more capital should be retained. As it is, Lloydsâ€™ 2.25p-a-share ordinary dividend (ignoring the 0.5p special) offers a yield of 3.2%. Not bad by recent standards, but there was nothing in Lloydsâ€™ actual trading figures for 2015 to indicate old-fashioned growth. Pre-tax profits actually fell 7% to Â£1.64bn, dragged down by yet another thumping provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance. Net income was virtually flat. And boss AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio said he wonâ€™t achieve his desired cost-to-income ratio until the end of 2019, about two years later than planned. One of the culprits for the latter was â€œthe lower for longer interest rate environmentâ€\\x9d. Thatâ€™s not going away soon. PPI provisions will, Lloyds hopes, but the lending climate in the UK looks downright dull. Even at Lloydsâ€™ preferred â€œunderlyingâ€\\x9d level â€“ in other words, ignoring the nasties â€“ profits were only up 5% to Â£8.1bn. That was in a good year for the UK economy; the weather could turn rougher. On the bright side, there are worse prospects than dull market leadership, especially when it is endorsed by a disgracefully tame competition regulator. The alternative investment choices for bank investors are litigation hell (HSBC), investment banking befuddlement (Barclays) or a bag of uncertainties (Royal Bank of Scotland). There is a separate question of whether Horta-OsÃ³rio and colleagues, now that they have taken Lloyds out of the emergency ward, still need to be paid danger money. The long-term incentive plan for 2016 awards Â£20m-worth of shares to 11 individuals. That is more than generous given the rewards already reaped.',\n",
              "  'Ted Cruz wins Jeb Bush endorsement as Republicans seek to stop Trump The Republican party establishment seized on Ted Cruzâ€™s convincing victory in Utah on Wednesday, as Jeb Bush endorsed the Texas senator and rallied other conservatives around the hope, however slim, that he could stop Donald Trump. Cruz won an overwhelming majority in Mormon-heavy Utah on Tuesday, easily exceeding the 50% threshold that, under the stateâ€™s rules, secured him all 40 delegates. â€œTo win, Republicans need to make this election about proposing solutions to the many challenges we face, and I believe that we should vote for Ted as he will do just that,â€\\x9d Bush said in a statement. There was a strong dose of wishful thinking, however, in the endorsement from the former governor of Florida, a candidate who dropped out of the presidential race after a string of disastrous performances. Trump secured the largest delegate prize of Tuesday â€“ the winner-takes-all state of Arizona â€“ with 47% of the vote to Cruzâ€™s 45%, in a state that is far larger and more representative of the wider country than Utah, which is dominated by a largely white and Mormon population. The billionaire frontrunner remains comfortably on track to finish the Republican race with the most delegates, which would give him a mandate for the nomination, even if he falls short of the 1,237 delegates needed to win outright. His opponents maintain the best way to block his nomination would be to first prevent him from securing the necessary tally of delegates, and that to do so they must coalesce around an alternative candidate at a brokered convention. The Democratic results on Tuesday followed a similar pattern. Frontrunner Hillary Clinton easily defeated Bernie Sanders in delegate-rich Arizona, while the Vermont senator registered resounding victories in Utah and Idaho, the latter of which was at stake only for Democrats on Tuesday. Sandersâ€™ victory margins in Utah and Idaho, in which he secured close to 80% of the vote, were by far the largest of the night, and are likely to energize his supporters, who maintain he still has a fighting chance of overcoming the former secretary of state. The senator is also projected to perform well in the next three Democratic states to hold contests in a few days â€“ Alaska, Hawaii and Washington â€“ and could end the month with a growing momentum. But Sandersâ€™ path to the nomination remains steep, and would probably require a dramatic turnaround in the race. The state he lost, Arizona, was the more significant contest in the Democratic race both because of its larger haul of delegates, and because its demographics could foreshadow voting trends in parts of neighbouring California, which holds its primary on 7 June. The last state to vote in presidential nomination contests, California is usually an afterthought to campaigns. But this year the stateâ€™s delegate bonanza has the potential to play a decisive role in both the Democratic and Republican contests. Clinton probably has less to fear than Trump, not least because the delegates she won in primaries and caucuses are bolstered by the support of party officials, who also get a say in the nomination process, unbound by state results, as so-called superdelegates. They wonâ€™t say it publicly, but Clintonâ€™s top campaign officials are privately confident that on the current trajectory, Sanders will face intense pressure to pull out of the race before the July convention so that Clinton can turn to attacking her Republican opponent. At her victory speech in Seattle on Tuesday, Clinton immediately positioned herself as the Democratic commander-in-chief in waiting, with a staunch critique of how her Republican rivals responded to the terrorist attacks in Brussels earlier in the day. Trump, who recently suggested the US should reconsider its role in the Nato defense alliance â€“ a cornerstone of Washingtonâ€™s foreign policy for decades â€“ responded to the terrorist atrocity by repeating his call to waterboard terrorism suspects. On Wednesday, he told ITVâ€™s Good Morning Britain that Muslim communities were â€œabsolutely not reportingâ€\\x9d terror suspects in their midst. Cruz, meanwhile, has been widely criticized for reacting to the attacks with a call for law enforcement patrols of Muslim neighborhoods. â€œIn the face of terror, America doesnâ€™t panic, we donâ€™t build walls or turn our backs on our allies,â€\\x9d Clinton said during her address. â€œWe canâ€™t throw out everything that we know about what works and what doesnâ€™t and start torturing people.â€\\x9d She added: â€œWhat Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and others are suggesting is not only wrong, it is dangerous.â€\\x9d Widely disliked by his fellow senators of both parties, Cruz has mounted an improbable campaign to cast himself as the man who can unify the Republican party and defeat Trump. That push is complicated by Ohio governor John Kasich, who has remained in the race despite winning only a single state, his own. Bushâ€™s endorsement signals a shift in the tide, and adds pressure on Kasich to withdraw. Bush said the party had to overcome â€œthe divisiveness and vulgarityâ€\\x9d perpetuated by Trump. The tenor of the race seems unlikely to change soon, if an election night Twitter squabble between Trump and Cruz is any indication. On a night when world leaders were grappling with the repercussions of terrorist bombings in Brussels, Trump and Cruz trolled one another over their wives. The businessman wrongly accused Cruz of being responsible for an ad in Utah, which used a nude photograph of Trumpâ€™s wife from a magazine shoot 15 years ago. â€œBe careful, Lyinâ€™ Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife,â€\\x9d Trump wrote. Cruz responded: â€œPic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, youâ€™re more of a coward than I thought.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Cruz found out how to best Trump in a debate. But it's the end of their bromance The Ted Cruz and Donald Trump love story â€“ donâ€™t call it a â€œbromanceâ€\\x9d, now that Carly Fiorinaâ€™s used the word â€“ is over. It was a short-lived and incredibly well-documented political phenomenon that began last month when Trump conspicuously held his punches against Cruz in a debate, and Cruz happily returned the favor. Conventional wisdom held that Cruz was positioning himself as Trumpâ€™s best friend. And indeed, if Trump had any intention of dropping out â€“ or to put it in his terms, not-winning â€“ their special relationship might well have blossomed. But it was not to be. The first sign that things had gotten rocky came last week, when Trump started loudly questioning Cruzâ€™s eligibility to serve as president, since Cruz was born in Canada. Then, going into Thursdayâ€™s debate, perhaps the biggest question on anyoneâ€™s mind was whether Cruz would finally revise his policy of Trump appeasement and take him on. Well, the answer is in, and the two menâ€™s love â€“ forged of political convenience â€“ is officially deader than Ben Affleckâ€™s marriage. Ultimately Cruzâ€™s betrayal was born of his instinct for political self-preservation. He went after Trump early â€“ the moment that moderators brought up the question of his eligibility â€“ and he did it much more skillfully and with considerably greater success than anyone else has managed to date. Asked about whether his Canadian birth disqualified him for president, the Harvard-trained lawyer drove home his legal expertise even as he questioned Trumpâ€™s motives: back in September, Cruz noted, Trump had his lawyers look at the birther question every which way and nothing came of it. â€œSince September, the constitution hasnâ€™t changed,â€\\x9d Cruz said. â€œBut the poll numbers have.â€\\x9d Later in the two-and-a-half-hour debate, the dissolution of their accord got even uglier when Cruz, asked to address the meaning of his previous comment that Trump has â€œNew York valuesâ€\\x9d, didnâ€™t back off or even hedge. Cruz instead went for Trumpâ€™s throat â€“ the soft vulnerable spot that is Trumpâ€™s association with patently liberal, elite New York. â€œThe concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out,â€\\x9d Cruz said, adding to applause from the audience in South Carolina: â€œNot a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan, Iâ€™m just saying.â€\\x9d Cruzâ€™s response was cool-headed, exactly the sort of polished Princeton debate performance he was expected to deliver. And Trumpâ€™s counter â€“ that conservative William F Buckley came from New York â€“ wasnâ€™t the strongest. Though he lacks the formal debating prowess of Cruz, Trumpâ€™s secondary attack was more adept. Instead of preying upon Americanâ€™s economic anxieties or their irrational fear of Muslims and Mexicans, Trump invoked the spirit of New Yorkers after 9/11. â€œThe people in New York fought and fought and fought,â€\\x9d he said, recalling how the world â€œloved New York and loved New Yorkersâ€\\x9d. It was a tactic that Cruz, for all his own calculated lines of attack, didnâ€™t seem to have anticipated, and he backed off. And yet, despite the fact that it was quite possibly the weakest-looking Trumpâ€™s ever come out of a debate tussle with another candidate thus far, he didnâ€™t miss but a beat before pivoting to patriotism and the place where he does excel like no other: pulling heart-strings and reminding Americans of the things they fear. If Cruz ended the contretemps technically ahead in the abstract realm of argumentation, he was decidedly less so in the realm of the human and intuition. Speaking from the heart doesnâ€™t appear to come naturally to Cruz the way it does to Trump, even if it makes Cruz less susceptible to gaffes played off as bombast. Still, it was the kind of night that Cruz has reportedly been working toward, changing his debate style to be less lofty and more overtly aggressive. And there he succeeded. He may not have landed a definitive victory but he did something else: he answered the question of whether anything could ever stop Trump or even effectively counter his insults. And while Trumpâ€™s performance was certainly strong, but we may just have seen the first chink in his armor â€“ thanks to Cruz, and the end of their super sad love story.\",\n",

              "  'Deutsche Bank weighs on markets but Clinton rally limits damage - as it happened Worries about Deutsche Bank vied with an attempted rally after Hillary Clinton was deemed by many pundits to have won the first presidential debate, leaving European markets in an uncertain mood. For most of the day the concerns about the banking sector won out, but a revival in Deutache Bank itself - which ended the day unchanged - helped produce a mini-recovery. US markets did better, helped by a strong set of consumer confidence figures. And then there was the oil price, which fell sharply as the chances of a deal to curb output at this weekâ€™s producersâ€™ meeting seemed to recede. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets have confounded the initial enthusiasm generated off the back of the US presidential debate...This pessimistic continuation of Mondayâ€™s sharp losses says a lot about the expectations ahead of the oil-producers meeting conclusion. Todayâ€™s losses also say a lot about the wary nature of markets as we head into the business end of this election race, for we have seen before Donald Trumpâ€™s ability to defy any bumps along the way. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 10.37 points or 0.15% at 6807.67 Germanyâ€™s Dax dropped 0.31% to 10,361.48 Franceâ€™s Cac closed down 0.21% at 4398.68 Italyâ€™s FTSE MIB fell 0.36% to 16,134.71 Spainâ€™s Ibex ended down 0.27% to 8688.2 In Athens the Greek market lost 0.21% to 562.40 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.7%. Meanwhile in the oil market, Brent crude is down 3.2% at $45.79 while West Texas Intermediate has lost 3.4% to $44.36. On that note, itâ€™s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and weâ€™ll be back tomorrow. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, recently said there were too many banks in Europe, and now he has backing from a member of the Bundesbank: As we reported earlier, the Mexican currency bounced back from record lows in the immediate aftermath of the US presidential debate, with Hillary Clinton deemed by many to have won the day. And it could recover further, reckon Capital Economics. The consultancyâ€™s David Rees writes: The Mexican peso appreciated by more than 2% against the US dollar shortly after the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, appeared to prevail in the first US presidential debate on Monday. The fortunes of the peso in recent months have been closely tied with the likelihood that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will triumph in the upcoming presidential election. That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexicoâ€™s open and US-dependent economy. In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso â€“ and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies â€“ to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile. But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. And maybe there isnâ€™t an oil deal after all: The oil price continues to slide as the prospect of any deal to curb output at this weekâ€™s producers meeting in Algeria recedes. Despite the reported proposal to cut production by 1m barrels a day - to be discussed on Wednesday - it seems unlikely Iran will agree, keen as it is to return output to the levels it enjoyed before the economic sanctions on the country. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%. The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure. Iran could be targeting something closer to 4.5-5m barrels per day in output, making a freeze agreement unlikely this year. Brent crude is down 2.8% at $46.02 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has lost 2.94% to $44.58. Returning to the positive US consumer confidence figures, which seem to give more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be delighted to see an above-expectations rise in consumer confidence for September, which follows on from an already strong August. Yellen was singled out for criticism by Donald Trump during last nightâ€™s presidential debate, with the presidential hopeful accusing Yellen of keeping interest rates low for political reasons. The question now is whether Yellen pulls the trigger on a rate hike at the next Fed meeting â€“ which happens to take place just days before the polls open and America votes for its next president. Back with oil, and the producersâ€™ meeting in Algeria. The Wall Street Journal is reporting a deal would be put on the table involving an output cut of 1m barrels a day, but it is unlikely to be agreed tomorrow: The positive US data seems to have help inspire Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 67 points or 0.37%. American consumers are not being put off by worries about the global economy, oil prices, Brexit or the forthcoming election, to judge from the latest Conference Board figures. The consumer confidence index came in at 104.1, higher than the 99 reading analysts had expected and better than Augustâ€™s 101.8. This is the best level since August 2007. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence increased in September for a second consecutive month and is now at its highest level since the recession. Consumersâ€™ assessment of present-day conditions improved, primarily the result of a more positive view of the labor market. Looking ahead, consumers are more upbeat about the short-term employment outlook, but somewhat neutral about business conditions and income prospects. Overall, consumers continue to rate current conditions favorably and foresee moderate economic expansion in the months ahead. The Markit survey may have shown an improvement in September but the outlook is not all rosy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The service sector sent mixed signals in September, with faster growth of activity during the month offset by gloomy forward-looking indicators. Although business activity showed the largest monthly rise since April, inflows of new business slowed and employment growth was the weakest for three-and-a-half years. A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook. Whatâ€™s more, even with the latest uptick in activity, the overall rate of economic growth remains subdued. Add these service sector results to the manufacturing data and the PMI surveys suggest that the economy is growing at an annualised rate of only around 1% again in the third quarter. The slowdown in hiring means the survey results are consistent with a 120,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September, which is a solid rate of expansion but somewhat disappointing compared to the gains seen earlier in the year. The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook. Back with the US, and more better than expected economic data. Markitâ€™s initial purchasing managersâ€™ index for the service sector in September came in at 51.9, higher than the forecast 51.1 and Augustâ€™s final reading of 51. The composite index was up from 51.5 last month to 52. The outlook for Deutsche Bank continues to be uncertain, analysts reckon. Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said: We donâ€™t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now. We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they wonâ€™t switch off coupons, but it canâ€™t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justiceâ€™s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required: Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015.... Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders. The delayed sale of DBâ€™s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary â‚¬1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed... The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the â‚¬5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over â‚¬6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue... In February DB were adamant in protecting their AT1 investors, but it is something that may not be so happy with going forward as already embattled equity holders would get stung for providing this benefit. The going concern for the company should be maintained provided the payment of the litigation charges is not demanded in the short term. We see a demand for the fines to be paid urgently as an unlikely scenario. It is both in the interest, of the bank to continue to function, and of the authorities to receive payment. More on Deutsche Bank and the repercussions if there was to be state aid from Germany, with some saying the countryâ€™s finance minister Wolfgang SchaÃ¼ble will be the key player: Meanwhile Thomas Oppermann of the Social Democratic Party has weighed in: As has Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: The Clinton rally in US markets has fizzled out before it even began. Banks - in the wake of Deutsche Bankâ€™s share price fall - and Brexit continue to weigh on investorsâ€™ minds, while a fall in the oil price is also undermining confidence. With fading expectations of a deal to support the price at this weekâ€™s meeting of oil producers, Brent crude is down 2.66% at $46.09. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up just 5 points while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have opened slightly lower. US house prices have continued to rise sharply, perhaps dangerously so, according to the latest Case-Shiller index. Prices rose by 5% year-on-year in July, slightly lower than Juneâ€™s 5.1%. Thatâ€™s more than twice as fast as consumer price inflation. And David Blitzer of S&P Dow Jones Indices, which produces the report, reckons it canâ€™t last. â€œGiven that the overall inflation is a bit below 2%, the pace is probably not sustainable over the long term.â€\\x9d Wall Street is expecting the next few weeks to be pretty fraught, in the run-up to the election on November 8th. Art Hogan, chief market strategistat Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets, says: â€œVolatility is going to be the norm, not the exception over the next several weeks.â€\\x9d At one stage, we expected the US stock market to jump by around 0.7% at the open. But now weâ€™re heading towards a flat start. Reuters has now published the full quotes from Angela Merkel about the Deutsche Bank crisis: German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed hope on Tuesday that problems at Deutsche Bank could be solved after the lender made clear it needed no state aid with a $14 billion U.S. demand to settle claims it missold mortgage-backed securities. Asked during a news conference if Berlin was concerned about Deutsche Bank and was considering assistance for the lender, Merkel said: â€œI only want to say that Deutsche Bank is a part of the German banking and financial sector. And of course we hope that all companies, also if they face temporary problems, can develop in the right direction.â€\\x9d â€œI donâ€™t want to comment beyond that,â€\\x9d she added. Deutsche Bank said on Monday it had no need for German government help. Wall Street is expected to open a little higher in an hourâ€™s time, after New York has digested last nightâ€™s debate. Court news.... A rogue trader who scammed investors out of millions of pounds to fuel a hedonistic lifestyle of nightclubs and champagne has been sentenced to an extra 603 days imprisonment. Alex Hope, who was jailed for 7 years in 2015, incurred the extra penalty for failing to obey a confiscation order made against him. He had been ordered to repay Â£166,696, but has actually only handed over Â£1,00 so far. FCA director Mark Stewart says: As a result of the work of the FCA, almost Â£2.65 million was identified and frozen in accounts controlled by Mr Hope, which was returned to investors earlier this year. Mr Hope spent a significant proportion of the remainder of the funds on a lavish lifestyle, including gifts to family and friends. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the value of tainted gifts can be recovered and Mr Hope was ordered to pay a sum equal to the value of the gifts he made to friends and family. Hopeâ€™s outstanding penalty is accruing Â£36 interest per day, and heâ€™ll still owe the full amount once released. Hereâ€™s Hope back in January 2015 - he originally hit the headlines for running up a huge bar bill. German chancellor Angela Merkel has told reporters in Berlin that she hopes the â€˜temporaryâ€™ problems at Deutsche Bank can be solved. Sheâ€™s holding a press conference with Malaysiaâ€™s PM, Najib Razak. But she doesnâ€™t seem to have said much about the possible need for state aid to recapitalise the bank (something Deutsche insists isnâ€™t needed). Never work with animals, children, or the Scottish weather. Thatâ€™s the lesson from Grangemouth this morning, where energy company Ineos is celebrating the first arrival of its first shipment of US shale gas. My colleague Rob Davies has raced to see the big moment, but reports that itâ€™s too blustery for the boat to dock! Robâ€™s still doing his best to keep us entertained, though: The World Trade Organisation has added to the gloom this morning, by slashing its forecast for trade growth this year to just 1.7%, down from 2.8%. That would be the first time since 2001 that trade has grown slower than the world economy. Royal Bank of Scotlandâ€™s shares are getting a hoofing, down 4% today. Itâ€™s being hit by the worries over Deutsche Bank; RBS is also facing the prospect of a large penalty from the DoJ, for mis-selling toxic mortgage securities. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: The German bank is now down another 3%, and is threatening to drop under â‚¬10 for the first time in around 30 years. This has sparked another round of losses in the European banking sector, with Barclays, HSBC and Societe Generale all seeing notable declines. Royal Bank of Scotland actually surpassed Deutsche Bankâ€™s morning drop, percentage-wise at least, with investors fearful that the same kind of fine could hit RBS when its settlement with the US Department of Justice is finally revealed. That rally in the Mexican peso is fizzling out too, as the Clinton debate bounce comes to a halt: The sudden swings in the markets this morning show that volatility is back with a bang. With the US presidential election still up for grabs, and Deutsche Bank still troubled, this could be a wild autumn. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga is concerned that this morningâ€™s â€˜Clinton bounceâ€™ didnâ€™t last: Stock markets received a slight welcome boost on Tuesday with most major arenaâ€™s swinging back into gains as talks of Hillary Clinton winning the first US presidential debate renewed risk appetite. Although Asian equities managed to charge into green territory post-debate, gains were swiftly relinquished in Europe amid the heavy losses in banks and carmakers. Wall Street could be exposed to steeper losses if the bearish domino effect from Europe provides a solid foundation for sellers to attack. It is becoming increasingly clear that the short term gains observed in stocks are becoming unsustainable with the ingredients of bear market potentially leaving stock markets exposed to heavy losses in the future. If this selloff continues, Deutsche Bank shares will fall below the â‚¬10 mark for the first time in three decades: The Financial Times is reporting that one of Germanyâ€™s smaller banks has cancelled a bond sale, in a sign of edginess in the markets. Hereâ€™s a flavour: A regional German bank has pulled a bond sale citing â€œmarket conditionsâ€\\x9d, as Deutsche Bank shares have tumbled to fresh multi-decade lows. NordLB was due to sell a seven-year senior unsecured bond, but informed investors they would not proceed on Tuesday morning, report Thomas Hale in London and James Shotter in Frankfurt. The senior unsecured bond was initially expected to price around mid-swaps plus 90 basis points. The pulled Landesbank bond comes after Lufthansa also cancelled a debt sale on Monday, also pointing to the â€œpricing achievable in the current marketâ€\\x9d Oh dear, this morningâ€™s stock market rally is fizzling out -- before some Europeans have fully caught up with the drama in America. Deutsche Bank is to blame -- its shares have slipped to fresh record lows in the last few minutes. Currently down 2.65% at â‚¬10.29, a level not seen since the 1980s. This has send Germanyâ€™s stock market down 1% into the red, and erased the early gains in London too. Worries about Deutsche Bankâ€™s financial strength are, well, trumping any relief following last nightâ€™s debate. Other European banks are also falling, with Germanyâ€™s Commerzbank down 2.9%. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Declines in prominent German and Swiss banks have revived fears of a European banking crisis. Stocks had opened moderately higher in a small nod to establishment candidate Hilary Clinton winning the US presidential debate. As explained earlier, investors are worried that Angela Merkel might not step in to protect Deutsche from the possibility of a $14bn fine from US authorities. Deutscheâ€™s market value is now just $16bn, meaning it could struggle to raise enough capital to pay off the fine. Writing in the Telegraph today, Matthew Lynn argues that the situation is terribly serious: If the German government does not stand behind the bank, then inevitably all its counter-parties â€“ the other banks and institutions it deals with â€“ are going to start feeling very nervous about trading with it. As we know from 2008, once confidence starts to evaporate, a bank is in big, big trouble. In fact, if Deutsche does go down, it is looking increasingly likely that it will take Merkel with it â€“ and quite possibly the euro as well. More here: The Deutsche Bank crisis could take Angela Merkel down â€“ and the Euro The surge in the Mexican peso shows that investors are pleased with Clintonâ€™s performance, says Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK. She says: A vote for Clinton is considered a vote for the status quo and markets will welcome sustained accommodating monetary policy under her administration. City investors have been backing Hillary Clinton to win Novemberâ€™s election, according to IG: Gambling firm Betway have also cut the odds of a Clinton victory, to just 2/5: Betwayâ€™s Alan Alger, said: â€œDonald Trump was forced to backtrack and defend himself against Hillary Clinton for much of last nightâ€™s debate. The betting now firmly suggests the Democrat candidate has stretched her lead in the race to the White House. â€œClinton may have appeared weak during her bout of ill health earlier this month, but punters think she looked strong last night and weâ€™ve cut here odds from 4/6 to 2/5. â€œThose that think the Donald can talk his way back into the election battle can take 15/8 â€“ the longest his odds have been in over a fortnight.â€\\x9d However... we have been here before, in June, when the betting markets suggested Britain would remain in the EU. Back to last nightâ€™s debate... and Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that Donald Trump didnâ€™t do too badly: But The Economist itself reckons the Republican gaffed over his tax bill: FT editor Lionel Barber also calls it for Clinton: And polling expert Nate Silver shows how Trump kept shoving his oar in: Itâ€™s a bad morning for British workers at building supplies firm Wolseley. It has announced plans to close 80 UK stores, with the loss of 800 jobs, as part of a major restructuring. It hopes to redeploy some workers, but the axe could fall heavily at its distribution centre in Worcester. Wolseley shares have slumped by 3.8% this morning, after it also missed profit expectations. In other news....Deutsche Bankâ€™s shares are becalmed this morning, up just 0.1% at â‚¬10.31, after yesterdayâ€™s 7.5% tumble. Investors were rattled on Monday, following reports that German chancellor Angela Merkel was refusing to provide state aid to the lender. Deutsche Bank insists that it hasnâ€™t even asked for help, but with a $14bn fine looming â€“ close to Deutscheâ€™s market value â€“ the situation is tough. City veteran David Buik says the uncertainty over Deutsche is worrying: I feel sorry for CEO John Cryan who inherited a hospital pass, when he stepped up to the plate in June 2016. These shares have lost significant value â€“ down from â‚¬39 in January 2014 and â‚¬23.51 a year ago to â‚¬10.64 â€“ down 71% and 54% respectively. Just to put some meat on the bone in July 2007 Deutsche Bankâ€™s share price was â‚¬99.60! What markets cannot cope with is uncertainty and that sensation is there in spades, with John Cryan, probably very frustrated in being able to say very little. You can catch up with all the â€™s coverage of the debate here: US Election 2016 Hereâ€™s our expert panel verdict: And hereâ€™s David Smithâ€™s account of how Clinton scored points against her rival: Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to order on Monday night in probably the most watched â€“ and certainly the weirdest and wildest â€“ presidential debate in American history. She demanded explanations over his tax returns, his treatment of workers, his temperament as the man with his finger on the nuclear trigger. As he ducked and dived with incoherent excuses, she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt. Then, right at the end, like a long-suffering, frosty school principal, she decided to expel the ranting, sniffling, whining 70-year-old schoolboy who had not done his homework. Trump had said she did not have the stamina to be president. Icy and deadly, Clinton replied: â€œWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.â€\\x9d The Canadian dollar has also strengthened, in another sign that Clinton performed better last night (in the marketsâ€™ view, anyway). Arnaud Masset, analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The foreign exchange market reacted sharply to yesterdayâ€™s first US presidential debate. Emerging market currencies were broadly better bid, especially the Mexican peso but it was the Canadian dollar, which appreciated the most as experts concurred that Hillary Clinton had won this first round. The Canadian dollar was also in demand after the debate with USD/CAD falling back below the 1.32 threshold, down to 1.3166. Here are some video clips of last nightâ€™s debate, for those European readers who werenâ€™t awake in the middle of the night FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says the markets have awarded last nightâ€™s debate to the Democratic candidate, but itâ€™s not all over.... Round one of the U.S. presidential debate is over and as expected big punches were exchanged from both sides, but clearly no knockout blows were landed. Although polls were showing different outcomes of who won the debate, financial markets obviously declared Clinton as the winner. Asian shares recovered some of yesterdayâ€™s losses and European stocks opened higher, meanwhile U.S. futures are also indicating a positive open. However, the best financial asset proxy to the U.S. presidential race is the Mexican Peso which rose by more than 1.5% against the U.S. dollar after declining to a new record low yesterday. The higher the Mexican currency goes suggests higher probability for Clinton reaching the White House as Trump repeatedly raged against globalisation and free trade agreements. The Aussie, Kiwi and Yen also supported the opinion that Hillary Clinton won the first presidential debate. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale agrees: A snap poll by CNN/ORC has found that Hillary Clinton won last nightâ€™s debate, pretty conclusively. They report that: Hillary Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday nightâ€™s debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Donald Trump had the better night, according to a CNN/ORC Poll of voters who watched the debate. That drubbing is similar to Mitt Romneyâ€™s dominant performance over President Barack Obama in the first 2012 presidential debate. Voters who watched said Clinton expressed her views more clearly than Trump and had a better understanding of the issues by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. If you want a clear sign of which candidate won last nightâ€™s debate, in investorsâ€™ eyes, then look at the Mexican currency. The Mexican peso has surged overnight, gaining 1.5% against the US dollar. Thatâ€™s a decent recovery from the record low it plumbed yesterday. That means $1 is worth 19.575 peso, down from 19.9 peso before the debate began. The peso has become the marketâ€™s preferred measure of tracking the chances of a Trump victory, given his attacks on free trade and his pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Asian stock markets also rose overnight, as Trump and Clinton swapped blows over everything from the Trans-Pacific Partnership to the â€˜Birther rowâ€™ over Barack Obamaâ€™s origins. Tokyoâ€™s Nikkei jumped 1%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng gained 1.3%, and Chinaâ€™s main markets closed 0.6% higher. And thatâ€™s feeding through to Europeâ€™s markets this morning, as this graphic shows: Shares are rallying across Europe this morning, as investors digest the first US presidential debate (which took place while most of them were asleep). In London, the FTSE 100 index has gained 26 points or 0.4% in early trading. European markets are showing bigger gains, with the Paris market up by 0.7%. Traders appear to be taking the view that Hillary Clinton came out best yesterday, after a 90 minute battle in which Donald Trump lost his cool more than once. Although Clinton didnâ€™t deliver a knock-out blow, the Democratic candidate did seem more sure-footed on the key issues. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx points out that weâ€™ve not recovered all of Mondayâ€™s losses yet: With Clinton seemingly stumping Trump in the first presidential debate a semblance of calm has returned to the markets. Yesterday saw a series of market-wide declines prompted, among other things, by the reminder that come November Donald Trump could be the new President of the United States of America. This morning, however, the European indices have taken anywhere between 0.6% and 0.8% back, arguably thanks to Hilary Clintonâ€™s better received performance at last nightâ€™s debate. Whether or not that translates to a boost in the polls, especially given the contrarian, disenfranchised mind-set of many of Trumpâ€™s supporters, is unclear (perhaps explaining why the marketâ€™s good mood isnâ€™t as good as its bad mood was bad on Monday). For now, however, the European indices are rebounding and, considering Brent Crude is flat and Deutsche Bank is still effectively at all-time lows, itâ€™s hard not to pin the turnaround on the results of yesterdayâ€™s presidential nominee showdown. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors have a lot to think about today, both in the financial markets and the world of politics. Firstly, the US presidential race has gathered steam overnight after a bruising clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The two candidates to take control of the White House traded blows over economic policy, trade, and climate change. Personal issues, including Trumpâ€™s coyness to release his tax returns and Clintonâ€™s deleted emails, added extra spice to the battle. Listening under the duvet in Britain, the Democratic candidate appeared to outshine her rival. But hereâ€™s what my US colleagues thought: Donald Trumpâ€™s freewheeling approach spun wildly out of control in the first presidential debate as he was forced on the defensive during a chaotic clash with Hillary Clinton. Goaded by Clinton and pressed hard by moderator Lester Holt, the Republican nominee angrily defended his record against charges of racism, sexism and tax avoidance for much of the 90-minute clash at Hofstra University, outside New York. Trump hit Clinton on trade and her political record â€“ issues that have helped him draw level in recent polls and may yet dominate the election â€“ but the property tycoon appeared thin-skinned and under-prepared as he sniffled his way through the debate. Clinton shows strength over Trump in one of historyâ€™s weirdest, wildest debatesRead more â€œItâ€™s all words, itâ€™s all soundbites,â€\\x9d he retorted after a particularly one-sided exchange, adding that Clinton was a â€œtypical politician: all talk, no actionâ€\\x9d. More here: And here: Closer to home, traders are watching Germanyâ€™s largest bank with growing concern. Yesterday, Deutsche Bankâ€™s shares hit their lowest level in a generation as it fought to persuade investors that it doesnâ€™t need to be bailed out by the Berlin government. But Deutsche Bank still faces the threat of a $14bn fine for mis-selling US mortgage securities, so concerns over its future arenâ€™t going away. And then thereâ€™s the oil price; energy ministers are expected to hold an informal Opec meeting on Wednesday to discuss a potential deal to cap production. Brent crude rallied late last night, on hopes Also coming up today Britainâ€™s business leaders are gathering for the Institute of Directorsâ€™ annual convention. Weâ€™re expecting to hear a lot about Britainâ€™s exit from the European Union, after fears of a â€˜Hard Brexitâ€™ sent the pound down to a five-week low yesterday. At 11am BST, the CBI publishes its retail sales figures for September. That will show if consumers kept spending despite Brexit uncertainty. The latest US house prices figures are due at 2pm BST (9am in New York), followed an hour latest by the consumer confidence stats. And in the City, weâ€™re getting results from holiday group Thomas Cook and building supplies firm Wolseley.',\n",
              "  'Mark Carney has had the last laugh on amateurish Theresa May You want me to stay for an extra three years? Iâ€™ll do one more and then Iâ€™m off. Mark Carneyâ€™s decision to leave the Bank of England in 2019 looks to be a straightforward snub to Theresa May. Earlier on Monday, the prime ministerâ€™s spokeswoman described the governor as â€œabsolutelyâ€\\x9d the best person for the job, which is the sort of thing you say if you think heâ€™ll do the full eight-year term. But heâ€™s doing six. Yes, itâ€™s one more year than was signalled back at his appointment, but it is not the full deal. Those angry Tory Brexiters who have been making mischief at Carneyâ€™s expense for the past month will count this result as a victory for them. May has played this saga terribly. The Brexitersâ€™ grumbles about Carneyâ€™s pre-EU referendum comments were fading from most peopleâ€™s memories before she breathed new life into the soap opera in her speech to the Conservative party conference a month ago. She complained about the â€œbad side-effectsâ€\\x9d of low interest rates and quantitative easing, and said â€œa change has got to comeâ€\\x9d. What sort of change? She didnâ€™t say, but suddenly it was open season on Carney. The Brexiters who resented Carneyâ€™s comments that leaving the EU would be the â€œbiggest domestic risk to financial stabilityâ€\\x9d popped up to denounce the governor and all his works. Michael Gove said Carney should learn some humility. Nigel Lawson thought he should resign. If he must stay, said the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, Carney should know his place. â€œItâ€™s important to comport yourself as a quiet and discreet public servant,â€\\x9d he said. William Hague was a rarity in being a remainer, but he filled in Mayâ€™s blank about the possible form of change. Central bankers had lost the plot in their addiction to low interest rates, Hague argued, and â€œthe era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its endâ€\\x9d. Would those voices have been so emboldened had May not spoken? Itâ€™s hard to say, but the chorus line has been an extraordinary spectacle. Senior politicians, even those who are years out of office, are normally wary of treading on the Bankâ€™s operational independence. Suddenly, the criticisms were personal â€“ Hague excepted â€“ but also woefully vague about alternative monetary prescriptions. Does anybody seriously believe the UK economy would be in better shape if only interest rates had been, say, 3% for the past few years? May, we were told after the conference speech, did not mean to question the Bankâ€™s independence and was merely expressing sympathy with savers. She should learn to take care. Her words provoked a pointless row about central bank independence and she ended up begging Carney to stay. In the event, the governor has agreed the shortest possible extension. He has had the last laugh while Mayâ€™s handling looks amateurish. Clara Furse: from bailed-out director to HSBC UK chair Former director of bailed-out bank to chair of HSBC UK. That is probably not how Clara Furseâ€™s appointment will be announced, but it would be accurate. Furse was a non-executive director of Belgian bank Fortis when, in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland, it did the disastrous top-of-the-market purchase of ABN Amro in 2008. As with RBS, a state-sponsored rescue for Fortis followed. Furse, a former successful chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, was rehabilitated via a stint on the Bankâ€™s financial policy committee. All the same, chairing HSBCâ€™s ringfenced division in the UK is a big job. If Fortis had been British, would she be deemed suitable by the regulators? Itâ€™s hard to think so. Tescoâ€™s Â£100m damages claim may not be so damaging A group of 124 British institutional funds want to be paid at least Â£100m in damages by Tesco. The poor souls feel terribly misled by the supermarketâ€™s overstatement of profits a couple of years ago and are calling for their investors to be compensated for the subsequent fall in the share price. That, at least, is the official explanation for filing a claim in the high court, courtesy of Bentham Europe, a group that funds such legal actions. Some of the fund managers may indeed be driven by the righteous sense that investors â€œhave a right to rely on statements made by companies to ensure that they correctly allocate capitalâ€\\x9d, as Benthamâ€™s Jeremy Marshall puts it. But more than a few, one suspects, arenâ€™t terribly interested in US-style litigation and would be happy to take the rough with the smooth, if only everybody else would. They may be participating solely because they fear missing out if Tesco ends up having to write a cheque. Last year, Tesco settled a similar class action in the US for a fraction of the value of the initial claim. In the latest case, the supermarket could try offering the litigants, say, Â£10m for their nuisance value and see if their heart is really in it.',\n",
              "  'California treasurer imposes year-long ban on working with Wells Fargo Californiaâ€™s state treasurer announced on Tuesday that it is imposing a year-long ban on working with Wells Fargo after staff â€œfleecedâ€\\x9d the bankâ€™s customers by creating 2m unauthorized accounts. The move by the USâ€™s largest state comes as the bank faces another grilling in Congress over the scandal that has already led the bank to pay $185m in penalties and clawback millions in bonuses from top executives. â€œThe recent discovery that Wells Fargo & Company fleeced its customers by opening fraudulent accounts for the purpose of extracting millions in illegal fees demonstrates, at best, a reckless lack of institutional control, and, at worst, a culture which actively promotes wanton greed,â€\\x9d John Chiang, Californiaâ€™s state treasurer, wrote in a letter to the bank on Tuesday. Chiangâ€™s office oversees nearly $2tn in annual banking transactions and manages a $75bn investment pool. â€œMy office has long relied on Wells Fargo, our oldest California-based financial institution, as a partner to meet the stateâ€™s investment and borrowing needs,â€\\x9d wrote Chiang. â€œBut, to borrow from Albert Einstein, â€˜Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with [larger] matters.â€™ In the case of Wells Fargo, how can I continue to entrust the publicâ€™s money to an organization which has shown such little regard for the legions of Californians who have placed their financial well-being in its care?â€\\x9d The $185m settlement announced at the end of the month was a result of an audit that revealed that Wells Fargo staff created as many as 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts without customersâ€™ consent. As a result, the bank fired more than 5,300 employees. The bank denies that the creation of these accounts was part of an orchestrated effort. According to bankâ€™s critics, the bankâ€™s staff opened such unauthorized accounts in order to meet their sales quotas. The bank announced yesterday that it is terminating all of its sales quotas starting 1 October. In light of this scandal, Chiangâ€™s office has effective immediately suspended its investment in all Wells Fargo securities, use of Wells Fargo as a broker-dealer for investment purchases and use of Wells Fargo as managing underwriter on negotiated sales of California state bonds. These sanctions are in effect for 12 months during which Chiang asked that Wells Fargo quarterly report back its compliance with the terms of its $185m settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Los Angeles city attorney, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Chiang has also called for separation of the chief executive and chair positions at Wells Fargo â€“ both of which are currently held by John Stumpf, a review of Wells Fargoâ€™s compensation practices and clawbacks of pay for those executives who are linked to the predatory sales practices. â€œWells Fargo has diligently and professionally worked with the state for the past 17 years to support the government and people of California. Our highly experienced and proven government banking, securities and treasury management teams stand ready to continue delivering outstanding service to the state,â€\\x9d a Wells Fargo spokesperson told the . â€œWe certainly understand the concerns that have been raised. We are very sorry and take full responsibility for the incidents in our retail bank. We have already taken important steps, and will continue to do so, to address these issues and rebuild your trust.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Benedict Cumberbatch webchat: your questions answered on kung fu, a wayward cloak and going shirtless Bened1ctCumberbatch Iâ€™ve got to rush off to the premiere now, but thanks for your questions and sorry for not being able to answer more of them! Also, sorry for not dealing with the more political ones â€“ itâ€™s hard to do them justice in such a short time. Scott McLennan asks: A hypothetical for you, Benedict: after witnessing your polished performance of Comfortably Numb with Pink Floydâ€™s David Gilmour last month, your all-time favourite act comes to you asking you to perform with them the song youâ€™ve always dreamed of singing live in front of a massive audience. What song do you choose? Bened1ctCumberbatch David texted me â€“ I resisted for a while, especially because of those who had gone before â€“ David Bowie and Kate Bush, among the legends. But then I realised Iâ€™d probably regret not standing beside him listening to him playing the body of the song, singing like a dream, more than Iâ€™d regret doing something out of my comfort zone! Simother Simother I love Mads Mikkelsen, what was it lime to work with him in Dr Strange? You worked with his brother is Sherlock, do you have a favourite out of the two? How are they different as actors? Bened1ctCumberbatch I do not have a favourite. Theyâ€™re both wickedly cool and fantastically talented. What a family! I loved working with Mads. He was a gentleman, especially when it came to the fights. It was always about making it better than making himself look good â€“ which he does flawlessly, I might add! Simother asks: I was wondering whether you â€œbuildâ€\\x9d a role up with backstories etc? Carice van Houten f.i. says that she just turns up and says the lines. A while ago you played an American (Johnny Deppâ€™s brother; forgot the name of the movie, sorry) one of the things I notice between American and English is that English is quite precise and requires a lot more strength from the muscles in oneâ€™s mouth. Do you prepare for things like that? You play a lot of parts in a short amount of time (I donâ€™t know if you still do that since you have a family), if you do work with a backstory (as well as learn your lines) what do you do if you do do that and how long does that take you, in general? Also how do you â€œtake your selfâ€\\x9d out of the character? For instance, when you played Stephen Hawking, given the physical aspect of that part, in that moment it is your body who is bringing that into expression, but it might not be comfortable, how do you separate these things? Anyhow, I love your work and how broad it is. Bened1ctCumberbatch Yes, I do build up a backstory in my head even if itâ€™s just for me. I remember asking Steven Moffatt what his backstory was for Sherlock â€“ â€œOh, heâ€™s just brilliant!â€\\x9d was his response. Thatâ€™s lasted until this series, where youâ€™ll find out a lot more about his backstory. As far as preparation goes, itâ€™s important to understand the who, what, where, why of the character before you meet him. That helps the character employ those tactics for whatever action theyâ€™re trying to perform, which can necessitate a limit of choice as well as a discovery of new things to be learned as an actor to portray the character with. For example, a character I played in a Martin Crimp play called The City at the Royal Court, was describing an incident where he was humiliated in his new job to his wife, and I began to characterise the voices in his story when Katie Mitchell [director] pointed out that it was unlikely he would have the confidence to do that as opposed to me, because I could. Those differentiations are vital, but often (and this really ainâ€™t no humblebrag) Iâ€™m chasing the tailcoats of my characterâ€™s abilities, whether itâ€™s their intelligence or professional excellence, or even their ability to sing/play piano/ride a horse/paint some of the great works of modern art! All these things require a heavy tutoring in new skill sets, one of the many privileges of our job, ie getting to learn new stuff and continuing with a form of further education, I suppose. And the results, while varied, sometimes work, but itâ€™s all smoke and mirrors, and I often feel like a horrible fraudster. I think the worst is when I played violin as Sherlock â€“ a skill that takes years of childhood and adolescent practice time. Iâ€™m feeling at this point that Alan drew some short straw in an office competition â€“ while (forgive me) your question is long, my answer is more verbose and Iâ€™m worrying for his fingers! But just to finish, vocal and physical differences, prep of any sort, work on a backstory, learning a skill, all has to be given time and when it isnâ€™t you run into generalising, and Iâ€™m fully aware Iâ€™ve done that on occasion, and so aim to create enough space around my work so there is enough space between roles and I have enough time to honour the tasks each present me with. Your last part of the question ... I have a lot to distract me that is away from my work and things that are more important, namely my family, so whether itâ€™s through them or a little bit of exercise and fresh air, reconnecting with friends and stepping outside the bubble, I do manage to disconnect and disentangle myself from my work. I think thatâ€™s as important for everyone around me as myself to be able to do. Paper_Cranes asks: What book are you reading at the moment? Bened1ctCumberbatch A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara and an Edison biography by Paul Israel, and Doctor Strange â€“ Strange Tales Volume 2 Collected Comics. PixieBlue asks: Christopher and Valentine [Paradeâ€™s End] â€“ would they have had a happy life together in the end? The book suggests yes, but what do you think? Bened1ctCumberbatch I think the book suggested not, actually? I think they had quite a tempestuous relationship, but I may be remembering wrong. LauraJukes asks: Do you ever ask for input on characterisation choices from your friends and family or is it quite a solitary process? Bened1ctCumberbatch Yes, of course there is an element where I trust their good taste, but itâ€™s never solitary. This is such a collaborative process. Kevin Feige and Scott Derrickson were incredibly open to improvisations and alterations and Iâ€™m fine with giving choices for editors and directors to use or not use. TejaSwan asks: As an actor what kind of intellectual/physical challenges have you encountered in portraying Doctor Strange? Does the character have any characteristics that resonate with your personal beliefs? Bened1ctCumberbatch There were a lot of physical challenges to playing this role that involved the usual fitness regime and dietary discipline which I wonâ€™t bore you with, but was certainly a help when it came to the obligatory shirtless moment. Beyond that need for a certain aesthetic, I really did need to get fit to keep healthy and also to do the kung fu fight sequences, car chases and aerial acrobatics in wires and on the gravity rig we use for what we term the Magical Mystery Tour moment where the Ancient One sends Strange on a trip through the multiverse. Intellectually, I read, talked to and watched (on YouTube) neurosurgeons at work â€“ what a fascinating area of medical science, dealing in ethical as much as medical complexities. I read two fascinating, heartbreaking and inspiring books â€“ Dr Marshâ€™s Do No Harm and When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. Highly recommended reads whatever your interests, as both are beautiful and profound insights into human nature as much as their chosen professions and particular experiences. albert23 asks: Do you worry about over-exposure? (Side question: do you need a rest?) Wasnâ€™t it odd there was once a sitcom where Sherlock Holmesâ€™ dad was Dr House, and his dadâ€™s partner Dr Who? What role should Anna Chancellor now be playing? Thanks for your concern â€“ not in terms of my work, but maybe the demands of publicity or the idea that Iâ€™m permanently trying to sell something when Iâ€™m not working, which isnâ€™t true. I have had a nice rest of late and it was much needed, so sorry to be bombarding your airwaves with this film arriving! It must get very tedious, but apparently there is a choice for you out there and you donâ€™t have to listen to it, read it, worry about it. But I thank you for your concern! Anna C should play ... Mrs Hudson? I donâ€™t know. Xanthe 2d asks: Do you ever wish that you could have played Hamlet before you became so well known? Bened1ctCumberbatch Thatâ€™s a very good question. I didnâ€™t find fame a hindrance in rehearsals and discovering the part with the extraordinary Lyndsay Turner and our immensely talented cast, and I might not have been able to play the role earlier in my career anyway. I wanted it to be generous as far as the amount of people who saw it, hence the scale of the production, and NT Live broadcasting it to cinemas then and still now, on occasion, so if my fame was seen as a negative because of early reviews or overzealous fans filming it, I really didnâ€™t let that bother me for the three months of the extraordinary experience playing this most demanding of all roles. My memories are overwhelmingly positive from that experience. Fame is a funny fish, and while I respect the criticism that â€œyou ask for it mate, youâ€™re an actorâ€\\x9d, I appreciate the fact that itâ€™s possible to be famous for your work, and if your fame intrudes on that, it can be difficult. Despite a slow news cycle during a long summer, even though there were important things happening in the world and that becoming some kind of headline, as far as my day to day in rehearsing, performing and the whole production of Hamlet, it didnâ€™t tip the focus in a direction that was negative for long enough to have a negative effect. Sorry, I am speaking so slowly to aid Alan, who is typing furiously that Iâ€™m having difficulty remembering what Iâ€™m saying at the beginning of my sentences â€“ itâ€™s not Alanâ€™s fault! And itâ€™s not Alan Rusbridger, in case you were wondering Dzh Akhmedova asks: Hello, mr Benedict! What is your favourite coffee? Bened1ctCumberbatch A flat white, but I also like black with no sugar. AriaVerner18 asks: I adore Your acting skills (both on the screen, and in theatre), I hope You for a long time will please us with new roles! I have a question: whether you have a favourite holiday and why? And also, whether something has changed for you after a role of Doctor Strange? Forgive mistakes in the text. :) Bened1ctCumberbatch I donâ€™t do favourites, but it has to be the last one I had with my family all together in Mauritius, a beautiful country and beautiful people. Elizabeth_Bezushko asks: Which detail is your favourite in Dr Strangeâ€™s clothing? Bened1ctCumberbatch The cloak of levitation â€“ weâ€™ve got a good thing going and it has a large look out for me and I for it. Weâ€™re beginning to work well together now, although it was a difficult start to the relationship â€“ it going one way, me going another â€“ it going on meal breaks when I needed to be in front of the camera and one or two contractual issues. But now weâ€™re very happy partners in crime. LauraJukes asks: What is your favourite thing about theatre work? (Can I also just say Hamlet was an incredible production and I feel privileged to have witnessed it live!) Bened1ctCumberbatch Thank you very much! My favourite thing is the immediacy of communication and the tightrope walk of being live, added to which playing an entire character arc in a short time is something you crave after filming. Equally, you crave the intimacy of a camera after a lot of exposure to live audiences, so I like to mix it up. Carlos Montgomery asks: What two characters have you played that you believe would like each other as friends? Bened1ctCumberbatch Thatâ€™s a very good question â€“ none, I think! They all have very different worldviews and are enjoyable to play because of that, but I suppose good friendships can survive that. aruaiman05 asks: Iâ€™m from Kazakhstan. It may sound random, but what is your favourite dish? Thank you very much! Bened1ctCumberbatch: I donâ€™t do favourites, but some dim sum I had recently in Hong Kong was extraordinarily good! elisalong asks: I consider you to be one of the most talented and greatest actors of the recent era. What advice would you give to those seeking to enter the acting profession? Thank you for your time and I hope you rock your socks off in Doctor Strange! Bened1ctCumberbatch Iâ€™d be my baby boy, to understand what he thinks of the world, what weâ€™re sjowing him of it, and to understand if weâ€™re doing all right as parents. serina miller asks: Is doing a musical is on your bucket list, because you will be an incredible Phantom in the Phantom of the Opera, also Sir James in Finding Neverland! Bened1ctCumberbatch It is on my bucket list â€“ but like a lot of things I donâ€™t have a specific role in mind. Iâ€™ll have a think! Hooray! Benedict is with us now! Three minutes, weâ€™re told â€¦ Message from our reporter Alan Evans: Benedict is currently running late in another interview â€“ butâ€™s heâ€™s on his way. While weâ€™re waiting, hereâ€™s the review of Doctor Strange we published earlier. Following an award-winning breakthrough on stage as Frankenstein, Benedict Cumberbatch has taken on everything from period dramas (Paradeâ€™s End, The Imitation Game) to Shakespeare (Hamlet, Richard III) and thrillers (Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy, Black Mass); heâ€™s worked with Steven Spielberg and Steve McQueen, and played characters as varied as Stephen Hawking, Vincent Van Gogh and Julian Assange. Click here to read your questions, Benedict will be joining us very soon â€¦',\n",
              "  'We are perfectly positioned within Europe. Why change it? â€˜We should miss Britain a lot. But Britain would miss the European Union even more.â€\\x9d The speaker was a senior member of the Italian government, in response to a question about the attitude of Italians to the thorny issue of Brexit. The occasion was the annual Venice Seminar, where members of the Italian government speak frankly, but not for direct attribution, on the political and economic scene. For many years the views expressed at those seminars about the Italian economy have been a triumph of hope over experience. For example, the Italian economy managed, after the initial impact of the great recession of 2008-10, to contract further in 2011 and 2012 when even the British economy was beginning to recover. There was then a period of flatlining during which optimistic forecasts were offered to us, but never fulfilled, as Italians hung on to their substantial savings and spent little. It now looks as though Italian â€œconsumersâ€\\x9d â€“ ie citizens â€“ are dipping into their savings and the economy is finally growing again, assisted by various measures which it is claimed have boosted confidence. There is also, of course, the beneficial impact on real incomes of the lower price of oil. At a time when much of the gloom and doom emanating from Davos stems from the impact on the finances of oil-exporting nations, the bonus to oil-importing nations seems to have been underestimated. I hope I am not alone in being slightly surprised that, after the serious recessions experienced in the west and Japan as a consequence of the two oil shocks of the 1970s â€“ when huge increases in the price removed purchasing power and caused a serious inflationary spiral â€“ the reverse movement in oil prices should also be considered an all-round disaster. There are winners and losers. Apart from anything else, the impact on inflation is such that policymakers have a lot of scope to relax fiscal policy without in any way breaching their inflation targets. Italian ministers and officials are rightly calling for greater flexibility from Brussels with regard to fiscal rules on taxation and public spending. They feel they have gone a long way in meeting cries for â€œstructural reformâ€\\x9d of the economy, although there is no doubt plenty of scope for more. Meanwhile, as prime minister Matteo Renzi points out: â€œThe EU fixation on austerity is actually destroying growth.â€\\x9d The difference drawn by Italian officials between current attitudes towards the EU in the UK and Italy is between â€œEuroscepticismâ€\\x9d in the UK and â€œEurocriticismâ€\\x9d in Italy. (Edward Heath, who, as prime minister, took us into what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, had another word to describe the anti-Europeans in his party: â€œEurosepticsâ€\\x9d, pronounced with some venom.) The Italian government is already preparing for a conference in Rome next year to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Amid the travails of countries such as Spain and Italy during an economic crisis caused by the financial crash and exacerbated by the structure of the eurozone and its policies, the continued devotion to the euro has often puzzled outsiders. In that respect, it is interesting to see that our own prime minister, after some ambivalence, has adopted the view I first heard from George Soros: namely that by being a member of the EU but not of the eurozone or the Schengen agreement â€“ passport-free movement in continental Europe â€“ the UK has â€œthe best of both worldsâ€\\x9d. More than 60 years have passed since the Messina conference of 1955, where the groundwork for the Treaty of Rome was prepared, but which prime minister Anthony Eden refused to attend. His more enlightened successors spent most of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s trying to persuade the French that we wanted to rectify Edenâ€™s mistake. It is difficult for many of us who followed all the shenanigans â€“ including the successive â€œNoâ€™sâ€\\x9d from President de Gaulle â€“ to believe that, at a time when there are so many pressing problems that require pan-European cooperation, the Conservative party should be so obsessed with Brexit. From now until the referendum, the public are going to be bombarded with statistics from both sides. It will not be the end of the world if we leave, but it will almost certainly be the end of the UK, on the reasonable assumption that Scotland would want to break away. The idea that we should tear up treaty arrangements negotiated over decades, and then renegotiate from a position of bargaining weakness, almost beggars belief. Moreover, it is an ill-founded scare story that if we remain in the EU we are destined to participate in a political union. The others know our position and accept it, but are quite happy to go along with a Cameron claim that this reality is the result of triumphant negotiations on his part. There is endless reading available on the pros and cons of being in or out, but one highly readable book is Brexit by Denis MacShane, who was minister for Europe in the Blair government. It is subtitled â€œHow Britain Will Leave Europeâ€\\x9d but that is a publisherâ€™s come-on. MacShane hopes it wonâ€™t happen, but fears it will unless the pro-Europeans get their act together. My own view is that the British remain essentially conservative with a very small â€œcâ€\\x9d and, other things being equal, would balk at such a retrograde step. But the opinion polls are worrying for us pro-Europeans, and the prime minister, although now apparently having stood up to be counted, is terrified of how migration will affect public opinion. I therefore draw solace from the fact that last week the odds at William Hill were 2-5 for a vote to stay in and 9-5 for Brexit. The big question is: will voters follow the money in the end?',\n",
              "  'Public bodies made 1,119 errors in use of phone and web data in 2015 Seventeen people were wrongfully arrested or had their homes searched last year as a result of serious errors made by the police and security services after they had accessed confidential web and phone data, an official watchdog has revealed. More than 760,000 items of communications data, which track an individualâ€™s phone and web use, were acquired by police or security services in 2015, according to the annual report of Sir Stanley Burnton, the interception of communications commissioner. The report, published on Thursday, reveals 1,119 errors made by public authorities in their use of communications data in the calendar year â€“ a 20% increase on 2014. The watchdog found 23 cases involving serious errors, including nine â€œtechnical system errorsâ€\\x9d that led to 2,036 â€œerroneous disclosuresâ€\\x9d. The remaining 14 serious cases were the result of human error. Burntonâ€™s annual report says the serious errors led to 17 cases in which people who were unconnected to a police investigation were either arrested or had property searched that had nothing to do with the inquiry. A further six innocent people were visited by police as a result of errors and there were delays to welfare checks on seven vulnerable people. The watchdog also identified four cases in which communications data was acquired to identify a journalistâ€™s source without judicial authorisation. In one high-profile case, the watchdog found that Police Scotland had acted recklessly after the individuals concerned complained to the investigatory powers tribunal. In the other three cases the commissioner ruled that the conduct was â€œnot wilful or recklessâ€\\x9d and â€œdid not adversely affect any individual significantlyâ€\\x9d. Burnton says 145 public authorities had access to confidential data in 2015; 93.7% of applications were made by police forces and law enforcement agencies. The security services were responsible for a further 5.7% of requests and local authorities and other public bodies for the remaining 0.6%. The report criticises the prison service for not having an adequate translation strategy in place to monitor the calls and correspondence of prisoners using foreign languages. â€œThis was particularly relevant to those prisons with a high proportion of foreign national prisoners where a small number of inspections revealed that staff were being directed to listen to a large number of calls made in foreign languages but were not being provided with any guidance as to whether the calls should be translated,â€\\x9d Burnton said. â€œConsequently no benefit was being derived from the monitoring, which undermines the necessity and proportionality for it as the exercise cannot meet the objective for which monitoring was authorised.â€\\x9d The 761,702 â€œitems of communications dataâ€\\x9d include â€œidentifiersâ€\\x9d such as mobile or landline numbers, email addresses or bank or credit card details. A request for incoming and outgoing call data on a particular mobile phone over 30 days is counted as one item of data. The watchdog also received 62 reports of errors related to the 3,059 interception warrants, which allow the police and security services to access the content of calls, emails, and other messages. These ranged from â€œover-collection and unauthorised selection or examination of material to the interception of the wrong communications identifier or failure to cancel an interceptionâ€\\x9d. The prime minister, Theresa May, said Burntonâ€™s report â€“ and a second from the intelligence services commissioner â€“ recognised the diligence and rigour of those who use investigatory powers to keep Britain safe. â€œBoth reports contain details of the recommendations that the commissioners have made to continue to improve the way that these powers are used. The public authorities who have received these recommendations will be giving careful consideration to them and how to further improve their processes,â€\\x9d she said in a written statement to the Commons.',\n",
              "  \"Lukewarm reception greets Chris Evans's revamped Top Gear Comparisons between Chris Evansâ€™s and Jeremy Clarksonâ€™s Top Gear are not appropriate, programme insiders said in the aftermath of disappointing viewing figures and tepid reviews for Sunday nightâ€™s debut of the relaunched show. The BBC2 programme attracted 4.4 million viewers â€“ below the 5 million Evans had hoped for â€“ but sources said that it was unfair to make judgements based on the first episodeâ€™s ratings because that did not take into account the impact of the bank holiday and the numbers catching up online. Evans himself insisted the programme was a â€œhit.â€\\x9d The presenter tweeted: â€œTop Gear audience grew throughout the hour. FACT. Won its slot. FACT. Still number one on i Player. FACT. These are THE FACTS folksâ€\\x9d. The BBC released a supportive statement. Alan Tyler, its acting controller for entertainment commissioning, said that Evans and co-host Matt LeBlanc had â€œsuccessfully kicked off a whole new era in styleâ€\\x9d. He added: â€œWe are really looking forward to bringing our audiences even more thrills as the series continues.â€\\x9d Evans told the last week that he would be disappointed if the programme rated below 5 million, although that would be well below Top Gearâ€™s historic viewer numbers. The last series, featuring Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, averaged 6.4 million viewers. The BBC highlighted the fact that it gained viewers during the hour-long broadcast. A spokesperson added that, by Monday afternoon, Top Gear was the most popular show on iPlayer, with about half a million online views after the BBC2 broadcast, while spin-off show Extra Gear, fronted by motoring journalists Rory Reid and Chris Harris, was the second most watched. Reviews for the first episode were mixed, with some praise for its attempt to stick to the previous incarnationâ€™s format but others lambasting it as a poor attempt to imitate Clarkson and co, who are making their own motoring programme with Amazon. There was criticism of the lack of chemistry between Evans and LeBlanc, though the response to racing driver Sabine Schmitz was broadly positive. The Mail was scathing, describing the revamp as â€œat best like watching a Top Gear tribute band performing one of those unfunny celebrity sketches on Comic Relief ... It was so bad you could practically hear the champagne corks popping at Amazon HQâ€\\x9d. Andrew Billen in the Times was not convinced by the rapport between Evans and LeBlanc: â€œChemistry was what we were looking for here, but their badinage was no more than passable offcuts from an unmade transatlantic buddy movie.â€\\x9d His two-star review concluded: â€œWould we buy a used car show from this man? On this debut, only after some serious tweaking.â€\\x9d One person close to the production said that comparing Evansâ€™ debut on a warm bank holiday to previous series of Top Gear, which normally aired in winter, early spring or autumn, was â€œcomparing oranges and spannersâ€\\x9d. The most recent series shown during the summer launched in June 2013, and attracted 5 million viewers for the opening episode. â€œIt will take time as we know, but comparing volume figures for last night is a little bit unfair,â€\\x9d said the person, who asked not to be named. â€œThereâ€™s plenty for Chris and the chaps to build on. It was after all the very first show. It has plenty of room and time to â€Ž breathe and develop.â€\\x9d A bright spot for most was the performance of racing driver Sabine Schmitz and Evansâ€™ decision to drop some of Clarksonâ€™s blokeish demeanour. The Mirror said that even Clarksonâ€™s â€œmost sulky fansâ€\\x9d should find a lot to like about the show after his departure and the Telegraph welcomed the new teamâ€™s conservative approach. Its four-star review said: â€œGiven time to bed in, thereâ€™s little doubt that we will warm to the new regime. This time next year, most people â€“ especially those who donâ€™t subscribe to Amazon â€“ will probably have forgotten what all the fuss was about.â€\\x9d There have been numerous reports that Evans and LeBlanc do not get on, but the former Friends star has dismissed the claims as a â€œbig load of bullshitâ€\\x9d, adding that he â€œdidnâ€™t anticipate the ruthlessness of the British pressâ€\\x9d.\",\n",
              "  \"Facebook and other platforms 'will rob UK news industry of Â£450m by 2026' Platforms such as Facebook will suck as much as Â£450m out of the UK news industry in a decadeâ€™s time, according to a new forecast. A report by strategy consultants OC&C predicts that news producers, especially newspapers, are still to feel the full impact of the shift by younger generations to using social media to find their news. OC&C says that, based on the impact of platforms on other mature media markets such as music, about 30% of annual digital revenue could go to platforms. That would mean the likes of Facebook and Apple taking between Â£200m and Â£250m a year this year, rising to between Â£400m and Â£450m from 2026. The organisation says that the impact will be felt in both digital advertising, where platforms are already taking a 30% cut to sell ads for publishers on content such as Facebookâ€™s Instant Articles and on Apple News, and in subscriptions. Though many publishers with successful digital subscriptions such as the Financial Times and the New York Times do not currently sell the majority of such products through platforms, OC&C predicts that will become more common in the future. The Â£450m OC&C says will be taken by platforms comes on top of continuing disruption to news from the shift to digital that has already cost the UK industry almost half its total revenue â€“ about Â£3.5bn â€“ over the past decade, and will see further falls as digital ads and subscriptions fail to make up for lost print advertising and sales. The report says: â€œMost of this would hit the bottom line directly, presenting another challenge to the industryâ€™s finances â€“ and could force brands that have been household names for decades or even centuries to close or radically reinvent themselves.â€\\x9d The report also says that while more than two-thirds of over-55s still go straight to trusted news brands, about 41% of those under 34 use social media and other platforms as their primary way of getting news. The report says: â€œThese stark generational differences suggest a future in which platforms displace trusted brands as the key link between news content and audiences.â€\\x9d OC&C associate partner Toby Chapman added: â€œThe behavioural shift is kind of inevitable ... you canâ€™t just close your ears and pretend it isnâ€™t happening.â€\\x9d The report also warns that the shift to consuming through platforms presents other challenges for news provides beyond lost revenue, with news organisations reduced to mere financiers of journalism that appears elsewhere. Despite the bleak picture painted by the report, its authors say there are a number of measures news publishers can take to mitigate the impact of the shift to consumption on platforms. These include making sure their brand is prominent, both to stand out and to bring people to their own sites, and making the most of partnerships with platforms. They also suggest collaborating with other news organisations and lobbying government for protection. Chapman said: â€œThereâ€™s not doubt this is a bit of a warning signal for the industry, and needs to be treated seriously, but itâ€™s not a foregone conclusion. What happened in music does not need to be what happens in news.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Saturday Night Live: Trump played as a pawn while Clinton goes all Love, Actually Maybe itâ€™s the promise of a nice long vacation, or maybe itâ€™s having a nice thematic hook to hang their sketches on, but Saturday Night Live tends to excel at its Christmas episodes. Thanks to some over-long football and an inconsistent livestream, my viewing of this weekâ€™s SNL wasnâ€™t quite as linear or complete as I would have hoped, but there was clearly plenty of funny in the weekâ€™s show. The cold open began with a recap of Donald Trumpâ€™s recent cabinet picks, but that was quickly glossed over for a visit from Vladimir Putin (as always, shirtless), who snuck down Trumpâ€™s chimney to â€œstate officiallyâ€\\x9d that Trump is Russiaâ€™s Manchurian candidate. After gifting the president-elect with a suspicious-looking Elf on the Shelf, John Goodman arrived with an inspired take on Rex Tillerson, Trumpâ€™s nominee for secretary of state, who has a literal secret handshake with Putin and a firm plan for expanding oil drilling in Russia. As has become standard in these Trump sketches, Kate McKinnonâ€™s Kellyanne Conway got the best line â€“ she promised not to go too far away because, she acknowledges: â€œIâ€™m handcuffed to you for all of history.â€\\x9d While the show has, in the past, focused on Trumpâ€™s seeming incompetence, here the writers doubled down on the president-elect as a pawn, not even getting to say â€œlive from New Yorkâ€\\x9d before Putin and Tillerson beat him to the punch. Casey Affleckâ€™s self-deprecating monologue acknowledged that he seemed an anti-climactic host for this special pre-Christmas episode (and his awful scraggly beard was also smartly acknowledged). With some support from Alec Baldwin and Goodman, he vowed not to sing about Christmas, a welcome relief from the excess of musical monologues the show has been serving up in recent years. My livestream skipped before I could see whether he held fast to his non-singing vow; one can only hope. While singing monologues are often a weak spot on the show, I have long been an evangelist of SNLâ€™s Christmas-themed musical numbers â€“ â€œSantaâ€™s My Boyfriendâ€\\x9d, â€œDick in a Boxâ€\\x9d, and â€œTwin Bedâ€\\x9d remain all-time classics. This year, they delivered again; a pre-tape with Kenan Thompson and musical guest Chance the Rapper resurrected some classic hip-hop for an ode to Barack Obamaâ€™s final Christmas as president. Celebrating the â€œfirst and maybe last black presidentâ€\\x9d, the duo rapped about birth control and legal weed under the tree, with a guest verse about Leslie Jonesâ€™s love/lust for Joe Biden. It was catchy and clever and current, and Iâ€™ll have it stuck in my head all week. Weekend Update had a strong turn this week, with Michael Che comparing the meeting of Trump and Kanye West to the baffling mash-up of Scooby-Doo and the Harlem Globetrotters, while Colin Jost theorized that Trump chose Tillerson for secretary of state â€œbecause he was three cents cheaper than the Chevron CEO across the streetâ€\\x9d. And Fred Armisen and Vanessa Bayer resurrected their back-talking best friend characters as childhood buddies of Putin for a delightfully bitchy take on the Russian president. Despite her relatively low profile, SNL seems preoccupied with Hillary Clinton, or at the very least, with looking for excuses for McKinnon to resurrect her brilliant impression. This week featured a spoof of the only scene of Love, Actually that weâ€™ve all seen (the one with the cue cards), wherein Clinton tries to secretly convince an elector to vote for anyone other than Trump when the electoral college votes on Monday. â€œTom Hanks,â€\\x9d she urges. â€œThe Rock. A rock.â€\\x9d While it wasnâ€™t perfect â€“ one late sketch featuring a trio of horny elves was equally confusing and unfunny â€“ it was definitely an above-average turn for the series. There were some egregious examples of product placement â€“ Dunkinâ€™ Donuts and Microsoft â€“ but theyâ€™re working on fitting them in more seamlessly. Maybe during the break, the show will figure out a longer-term strategy for their Trump impression, since Baldwin would presumably like his Saturday nights back at some point. And given the pace of news this year, the showâ€™s writers will have a lot of catching up to do when they return in mid-January.',\n",
              "  'Twelve new arrests over Cliven Bundy standoff include Trump campaigner The FBI escalated its investigation into Nevada rancher Cliven Bundyâ€™s 2014 standoff with the federal government Thursday with sweeping raids across the country that resulted in 12 arrests, including that of a Donald Trump campaign coalition co-chair in New Hampshire. Two of Bundyâ€™s sons were also among those arrested, amid signs that federal authorities are ramping up their efforts against the ultra-conservative, anti-government movement that also inspired the armed standoff in Oregon earlier this year. Cliven Bundy had long refused to pay fees to the government to allow his cattle to graze on federally controlled public lands â€“ a dispute that escalated to an armed standoff in 2014 when officials tried to seize his livestock. Hundreds of anti-government activists, some heavily armed, flocked to Bunkerville to support the Bundys, and the government ultimately backed down. A federal grand jury last month indicted Cliven, 69, and his two sons Ammon, 40, and Ryan, 43, on a slew of felony offenses â€“ including armed assault of law enforcement officials and conspiracy against the government â€“ for the high-profile land-use dispute at the Bundy ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada. The latest arrests mean five members of the Bundy family, Cliven included, are in jail awaiting trial. If convicted, they could each face decades in prison. Ammon and Ryan Bundy have also been indicted over the standoff in Oregon, which lasted 41 days. Now two more sons of Cliven â€“ Davey, 39, and Mel, 41 â€“ have also been arrested in a coordinated operation that also involved the arrest of Jerry DeLemus, a 61-year-old New Hampshire co-chair for Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner. Those three, along with 11 other new defendants, now face prosecution for their participation in the conflict over government land restrictions. The charges include conspiracy to impede and injure federal law enforcement officers, threatening and assaulting officers, obstruction of justice, interfering with interstate commerce by extortion, and use of firearms for a violent crime. The stunning turn of events on Thursday brought the total number of defendants in the case to 19 and indicates that federal prosecutors are aggressively targeting the Bundy family and their rightwing supporters who have for years protested against the federal governmentâ€™s regulations on public lands. But in February, FBI officials arrested Cliven Bundy while he was on his way to Oregon to support an anti-government militia that had seized the Malheur national wildlife refuge to protest about the federal governmentâ€™s treatment of local ranchers. His sons Ammon and Ryan led this yearâ€™s takeover of federal lands in Oregon, which began on 2 January and dragged on for more than a month before the final holdouts surrendered to the FBI. Ammon, Ryan and five other men are now facing felony charges in both the Nevada and Oregon cases and could end up with significant prison time if they are ultimately convicted. Shiree Bundy, older sister of Davey and Mel, told the that Davey was arrested on Thursday morning in his hometown of Delta, Utah. â€œAnyone who knows my brother [Davey] knows he is the most sweet, calm guy. He is a good person, a father, a husband, a hard worker,â€\\x9d said Shiree, 45, who lives in Orderville, Utah. â€œHe wouldnâ€™t hurt anybody.â€\\x9d Davey was present in Bunkerville during the 2014 standoff â€“ like many in the family who returned to the ranch to support their father â€“ but he was never violent, according to Shiree. â€œHe stood there with my brothers as they asked them to let our cattle go,â€\\x9d she said. â€œHe didnâ€™t even have a gun on him.â€\\x9d When the standoff intensified in April 2014, Davey was briefly arrested and cited on misdemeanor charges of â€œrefusing to disperseâ€\\x9d. â€œThey had nothing to hold him on then, and they canâ€™t have anything on him now,â€\\x9d said Shiree, who noted that Davey runs a construction company and has six children, ages one to 14. This year Davey also told Ammon and Ryan that he was not willing to risk arrest and join them in Oregon, according to Shiree. â€œWhen they said, â€˜You should be up here,â€™ Davey said, â€˜Iâ€™m not going to go to jail again. I have a family and kids to take care of.â€™â€\\x9d Melâ€™s wife, Briana Bundy, said in a brief phone interview that her husband was arrested Thursday and that she didnâ€™t know what charges he is facing. â€œI donâ€™t have anything to say except wake the hell up, America. Itâ€™s time to decide what side of the line youâ€™re on,â€\\x9d said Briana, 30, who lives in Nevada and has five children, including a newborn baby. â€œI have my life to figure out. I have five kids now with no provider.â€\\x9d Mel was present at the Oregon occupation at the beginning of the standoff, but he was not one of the 25 people recently indicted in the Malheur wildlife refuge case. â€œAll we were doing was protecting our property,â€\\x9d Mel said in an interview with the last month. â€œThe federal government has overstepped its bounds.â€\\x9d Cliven, Ammon and Ryan have all been denied bail and remain behind bars. DeLemus, a Tea Party activist, was present at the 2014 standoff and also traveled to the Oregon occupation this year. The interviewed DeLemus on multiple occasions at the Oregon refuge in January, and the rightwing activist repeatedly said he was there to try to help negotiate a peaceful resolution. Last July, Trump announced DeLemus as a co-chair of his â€œVeterans for Trumpâ€\\x9d coalition in New Hampshire. His wife, Susan DeLemus, a Republican state representative, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. DeLemus also made headlines last year when he proposed a â€œDraw Muhammadâ€\\x9d art contest as part of an anti-Muslim demonstration. A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment. Two of the defendants newly charged this week â€“ Brian Cavalier and Blaine Cooper â€“ are already in federal custody in Oregon for their roles in the Malheur case. â€œThis investigation began the day after the assault against federal law enforcement officers and continues to this day,â€\\x9d US attorney Daniel Bogden said in a statement. â€œWe will continue to work to identify the assaulters and their role in the assault and the aftermath, in order to ensure that justice is served.â€\\x9d The new grand jury indictment includes defendants from Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Oklahoma and New Hampshire.',\n",
              "  \"Watch the reworked video for David Bowie's Life on Mars RCA had decided to release Life on Mars as a single. David called me â€“ if he wanted me to make a video, heâ€™d call me one or two nights before â€“ and said we needed to get another video together. He liked to do them, and so did I â€“ not that there was any budget. I somehow got hold of a completely white studio and that dictated the concept â€“ it was as simple as that. We showed up around noon, because none of us liked to start too early. As a cameraman, I had the guy who had shot the John, Iâ€™m Only Dancing video the year before, on stage at the Rainbow theatre. I was second cameraman. David looked amazing in his blue suit â€“ it was made by his mate Freddie Burretti, who made the Ziggy costume. Pierre Laroche, who also worked on the Aladdin Sane cover, did the great makeup. And there we were â€“ we just shot for no more than five hours, and then I had a couple of days to do an edit. We never had time to discuss any concept. And David never asked me to change anything. He was a very positive person to work with, very encouraging â€“ he had the ability to get people to do great things for him. He took direction very well. He was willing to do whatever you wanted him to do. I never found him resistant in any way, and he brought his charisma to the table. If he wanted to work with someone, he would let them get on with it. He would ask: â€œWhat do you want me to do, Mick?â€\\x9d And then he would do his thing. It was never like pulling teeth with David, it was like pulling gems. I had an amazing subject and an amazing song â€“ this was the song that had turned me on to David â€“ so what else did I need? David never looked like this at any other time. He never wore that suit again, never had that makeup on again. He never looked more amazing â€“ like a space doll. When his videos got inducted into the Museum of Modern Art in New York, this was the one that everyone stood for â€“ there were no distractions, no dancing girls, just David. At the time it was hardly seen at all, and it gathered some serious moss. In the late 90s, David gave me the copyrights for the four videos I had made for him, because I had never been paid for them â€“ not that I had looked for any money. So when Parlophone contacted me about re-editing it I said: absolutely. I had a little gem and I wanted to polish it into a state where it was absolutely perfect. I had the black and white segments, and when I came across that very last bit after the music stopped, I thought it was a little gift, so I made it into an epilogue. People like the original video, but I think this version takes it to another level. The scenes really add a new flavour for it. Iâ€™m really happy with it, and Iâ€™m interested to see what the fans make of it. David Bowie Legacy is released 11 November on Parlophone.\",\n",
              "  \"Thank God for the '@' symbol I can remember the days when I humorously used the â€œ@â€\\x9d symbol on my typewriter or computer keyboard to avoid using actual swear words. This admission outs me as, well, old â€“ and thus separates me from the millions of people for whom â€œ@â€\\x9d has always and ever been the symbol for â€œatâ€\\x9d in an email address. Raymond Tomlinson, the computer programmer who put that symbol into the email address, before the email address was even called the email address, as it happens, died at the too-early age of 74 last Saturday. He may well have been an intimidatingly brilliant man in every other respect of his life, but at his passing, he is being celebrated for doing precisely one thing. That is: for executing a keystroke of genius. Tomlinson did not invent email. But by creating a system in which a user name was separated from a network destination by the â€œatâ€\\x9d sign he invented email that would not intimidate an ordinary person. A slightly earlier email scheme would send messages to numbered mailboxes, and you can understand why this would not sit well with the general population. In America and the rest of the world, being identified by a number is emblematic of losing oneâ€™s identity. Itâ€™s like that old Johnny Rivers lyric: â€œTheyâ€™ve given you a number/ and taken away your name.â€\\x9d Sure, American citizens like their social security numbers, but theyâ€™re taught not to share them with just anybody. By keeping them closely guarded they get a payout in their golden years, or at least thatâ€™s how itâ€™s supposed to work. In any event, I think we can all agree that email-by-identity-number sounds like something youâ€™d encounter in a dystopian Orwellian nightmare scenario of the 1950s. Email by name, even goofy fake name, maybe especially goofy fake name, is friendly, personal, unpretentious. But that wasnâ€™t what motivated Tomlinson to use the symbol. According to his obituary in the New York Times, what initially attracted Tomlinson to â€œ@â€\\x9d was its sheer availability. The symbol was not present in the user names for the internet precursor he was working with in the early 70s, Arpanet. Despite the tendency of coders to use oodles and oodles of typographical symbols whose significance cannot be grasped by mere non-programming mortals, the symbol at the time had no meaning in the programming Tomlinson was doing. So, as Mount Everest once was â€œthereâ€\\x9d for George Mallory, so the â€œatâ€\\x9d symbol was there for Tomlinson. I call it a keystroke of genius because I do remember first using email in the early 1990s. A lot of the times when youâ€™re dealing with new technology, itâ€™s kind of a pain in the cognitive muscles to remember how to do it because it just doesnâ€™t make sense. A particularly petty-seeming example of this is putting a â€œ1â€\\x9d in front of a US telephone area code when making a call. Older phone users, again, like me, reflexively bristle: â€œWhen did the area code itself stop being enough?â€\\x9d When I first started on AOL, and then when I went to work as a consultant for CompuServe in the mid 90s, working on a project that was going to blow AOL out of the water (you can guess how that turned out), the email address system of a user name followed by an â€œatâ€\\x9d symbol followed by a destination name seemed so easy and intuitive as to feel natural. And this turned out to be the case even in countries where the â€œ@â€\\x9d had been nothing. Tomlinsonâ€™s available symbol also made perfect sense as regular person syntax, something that doesnâ€™t happen all that often. For making an action undertaken on a computer seem as intuitive (almost) as drawing breath, Raymond Tomlinson deserves all the salutes.\",\n",
              "  'Children with cataracts regain sight after radical stem cell treatment A dozen infants who were born with cataracts have regained their sight after scientists used a radical new stem cell therapy to regenerate healthy lenses in their eyes. The children, all aged under two, are the first to receive the treatment for a condition that remains the most common cause of blindness in the world. The small-scale trial on babies and toddlers was approved soon after tests in animals found that the approach should both work and produce better results than conventional surgery. â€œThe lens regenerated remarkably well,â€\\x9d said Kang Zhang who led the study at the Shiley Eye Institute at the University of California in San Diego. â€œWe restored visual function and that implies that a clear lens has regenerated.â€\\x9d Doctors will now monitor the children to see whether their eyes develop normally, or grow fresh cataracts, a possibility if the stem cells that regenerated the lenses carry genetic faults that cause the lens-clouding condition. The feat was applauded by experts in the field, with Dusko Ilic, a stem cell scientist at Kingâ€™s College London, calling the work â€œone of the finest achievements in the field of regenerative medicine.â€\\x9d â€œThey proved it first by testing a new surgical approach in rabbits and primates before successfully treating 12 infants with congenital cataracts. It is science at its best,â€\\x9d he added. When children develop cataracts at birth or soon after, they can be treated by making a large incision at the front and back of the eye. The cloudy lens is then removed and replaced with a clear artificial one. But the surgery has a number of drawbacks. It can cause inflammation that complicates healing, and about half of the stem cells that protect the lens are destroyed in the process. A further problem is that the artificial lens cannot grow as the child does. In a series of elegant experiments, Zhang showed that stem cells found around the lens, known as lens epithelial stem cells, or LECs, can regenerate healthy lenses if they are not damaged during surgery. In animals studies, he found that minimally invasive surgery, which removed the lens without destroying a surrounding structure called the lens capsule, preserved the stem cells and allowed them to grow and form a new lens. To treat the children in the trial, surgeons made incisions no larger than 1.5mm in both of their eyes. They then removed the cloudy lenses, taking care to leave the lens capsules intact. The incisions healed in a month, and within three months, all of the children had regrown working lenses. When compared to 25 children who had conventional surgery, the dozen in the trial had clearer lenses, less inflammation and healed faster. Zhang, who describes his latest work in Nature, now plans to investigate whether a similar treatment can work for adults with cataracts. While replacement lenses are highly effective in older people with cataracts, many need glasses for driving or reading after surgery. In the UK, the NHS carries out more than 300,000 cataract operations a year. â€œThis illustrates that there a can be a new approach. We can turn on own dormant stem cells. Just imagine how powerful this could be if we can do it for heart attacks, or turn on neuronal stem cells in the brain?â€\\x9d Zhang said. Graham McGeown at Queenâ€™s University, Belfast, said the work was a clear â€œproof of principleâ€\\x9d for an important new treatment for cataracts in children. â€œThis new approach dramatically reduced the risk of sight-damaging side effects when compared with the current best practice treatment, which involves more destructive surgery followed by implantation of an artificial lens,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIt is unclear, however, whether this would be of benefit in adults with cataracts, for whom current surgical techniques are usually successful.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"'Alice in Wonderland' NHS service let suicidal woman down, says coroner A coroner has criticised a national health service care system as â€œbonkersâ€\\x9d, saying it let down a vulnerable and suicidal young mother who went on to kill herself. An inquest heard that Rebecca Kelsall, 31, had sought counselling for depression but did not receive adequate care and later took her own life. The coroner John Pollard said that rules within Britainâ€™s mental healthcare regime had left Kelsall stranded without regular professional help. The inquest in Stockport, heard that Kelsall, who had two children, killed herself after NHS rules stopped health workers asking if she was ill, even though she had already told doctors she had been suicidal. Pollard described the rules as â€œbonkersâ€\\x9d, adding that it was a NHS care system worthy of a â€œworld in Alice in Wonderlandâ€\\x9d. In May 2015, Kelsall phoned a mental health clinic where she had received counselling to say she was too unwell to make an appointment. Later the same day Kelsall drank vodka and took antidepressants before hanging herself at her home in Stretford, Greater Manchester. During the inquest into her death it was revealed that Kelsall had sought help from an online therapist saying she was having suicidal thoughts. But she was told she would have to wait four weeks for a face-to-face meeting and in the interim she would no longer be able to seek help online. She eventually saw a psychologist and again said she had suicidal thoughts. She missed a subsequent consultation due to illness but staff were unable to ascertain the nature of her illness due to â€œpolicyâ€\\x9d banning â€œpersonal questionsâ€\\x9d. After missing a further appointment Kelsall was dismissed from the health service and no effort was made to check on her welfare, the coroner heard. It emerged that Kelsall was already dead when she was formally discharged for being absent at the second meeting. At the inquest Pollard condemned the healthcare system which treated her, saying it was â€œflawed and poorâ€\\x9d, and that she was a vulnerable person who should never have been discharged. Pollard said: â€œI believe that the fact somebody has already died and therefore cannot possibly attend their appointment is a pretty exceptional circumstance. This is very poor policy. This system has let her down. Here we have a vulnerable person with a history of problems, and because she doesnâ€™t turn up the system simply says â€˜discharge herâ€™. There was no concern that a woman with problems and a history of suicidal thoughts didnâ€™t attend. This seems to me to be a very flawed system. â€œI canâ€™t understand why she was not asked why she was feeling unwell. If I rang the bank to say I wouldnâ€™t be going in that day, I wouldnâ€™t expect them to quiz me about it. But if I rang my doctor surgery, who should be solely concerned with my health, to tell them the same thing, I would expect them to ask me why I was poorly.â€\\x9d Pollard said he would be writing to NHS employers and the Care Quality Commission to express concern about Kelsallâ€™s treatment. â€œI can feel myself slipping into the world of Alice in Wonderland here. This is a bonkers system. I shouldnâ€™t have to use words like bonkers but I feel itâ€™s appropriate here. People like Rebecca need a system they can rely on. She could have easily remained on the e-therapy system while waiting for cognitive behavioural therapy, and the only reason she didnâ€™t is because the rules wouldnâ€™t let her. This is something I am very concerned about and hope it will be addressed.â€™â€™ Kelsall sought professional help under the online system in September 2014. Rachel Jagger, a self-help coordinator for the website, said Kelsall said she was having suicidal thoughts once or twice week. â€œWe had a discussion about how she had been feeling tearful, how her sleeping pattern had changed and how she was finding it hard to cope from one day to the next. She reported feeling an intense eight out of 10 intention of self harming. But the next time we spoke her intention of self harming had dropped to two out of 10, though she was having suicidal thoughts once or twice a week.â€\\x9d Jagger said that Kelsall went on to cancel two further online sessions and was told she could no longer have access to the online service and would have to wait four weeks for a face-to-face meeting. â€œI told her that I would rearrange an appointment for her, but due to policy it would be the last time I could do so before she would be discharged. She told me she was struggling to complete the tasks online and agreed that it would be best to arrange a face-to-face CBT session. â€œUnfortunately, due to our procedure we had to remove the option for her to access the online service because there would have been nobody available to support her. She was very concerned when we explained she would have to wait four weeks for this meeting.â€\\x9d Kelsall was referred to Samantha Fox, a psychological wellbeing practitioner, and had two consultations with her. Fox told the hearing that Kelsall had experienced relationship problems in the past and her low mood was preventing her from going to work and socialising with friends. She said: â€œThis meant she was spending more time alone, giving her the chance to ruminate about things. She talked to me about her problem with alcohol consumption but that she felt it was something she was managing, and she also discussed her two failed relationships but never elaborated. I always felt it was difficult for her to discuss this matter, so I never knew much about it.â€\\x9d But Fox said Kelsall had failed to attend two further scheduled appointments, leading to her being discharged from the service. When asked by the coroner if Kelsall was contacted to find out why she was unwell, Fox said: â€œI do not believe that the admin department would ask a patient such a personal question about their health. If two or more appointments are missed, it is policy for us to send out a discharge letter. Unless there are extraordinary circumstances as to why they have been unable to attend, then they are notified that they have been dismissed from the service.â€\\x9d Kelsall was found dead on 31 May 2015 after her family raised concerns for her welfare. There was no suicide note. The coroner recorded an open verdict saying Kelsall might not have been â€œthinking clearlyâ€\\x9d at the time of her death. Her family were too upset to comment after the hearing. Vicki Nash, head of Mindâ€™s policy and campaigns, said: â€œA third of suicides are among people known to NHS mental health services and it is vital that when people do seek help they get the support they need. No one in touch with services, asking for help, should reach the point of taking their own life. â€œNHS mental health services are under enormous pressure at the moment as funding cuts over recent years have come at a time of rising demand. As a result many people arenâ€™t getting the right support at the right time, so they become more unwell and may reach crisis point. â€œWe know that suicides among people in touch with crisis teams have increased, as have suicides among people sent out of the local area for care, often because of bed shortages. It is unacceptable that the very service there to help people in crisis is unable to support people in the right way and help them to recover. â€œThis is why suicide prevention measures need to be accompanied by improvements to NHS mental health services. We have heard positive announcements in recent weeks about increased funding for mental health services. But without significant investment services â€¦ they wonâ€™t be able to start giving people the help they need, when they need it.â€\\x9d In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

              "  \"Trump's balancing act: what to expect from his immigration speech Immigration has been one of Donald Trumpâ€™s signature issues since he announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. From the moment he got off the escalator at Trump Tower in New York and spoke about Mexico deliberately sending criminals and â€œrapistsâ€\\x9d to the United States and the need to build a wall on the southern border, Trump hasnâ€™t stopped talking about immigration. But in his Wednesday speech on the topic in Phoenix â€“ which will follow his surprise visit to Mexico â€“ Trump will need to balance the hardline rhetoric he used throughout the Republican primary with the need to win a general election in November. Trump rode his hardline stance to victory in the primary. While his rivals refused to categorically rule out a path to legal status for any of the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States, Trump talked about â€œa deportation forceâ€\\x9d to remove all of them within 18 to 24 months. However, the Republican nominee never worked out his plan in detail. The Trump campaign has divulged little on its actual policy, save a set of proposals dating back to August 2015. At almost every rally, Trump pledges that he will â€œbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for itâ€\\x9d, but he has rarely gone into more detail. But, facing a general election where he has major deficits in the polls and is reviled by Latino voters, the Republican nominee has begun what he called a rhetorical â€œsofteningâ€\\x9d in recent weeks, raising questions about whether he was ever sincere in his hardline stance. In the past week and a half, Trump seemingly endorsed a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants in an interview with Fox Newsâ€™s Sean Hannity, only to reverse himself in an interview with CNNâ€™s Anderson Cooper. The back and forth prompted conservative talk radio show host Rush Limbaugh to admit, â€œI never took him seriouslyâ€\\x9d on immigration. Further, he announced late on Tuesday night that he would meet the Mexican president, Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto before the speech on Wednesday to discuss immigration. The ongoing furor has raised the stakes around Trumpâ€™s speech and stoked outrage about an apparent flip-flop. In a speech in Iowa on Saturday, Trump spoke about details from his August 2015 plan that had gone almost unmentioned since, including the implementation of E-Verify (an online system that allows businesses to screen employeesâ€™ work eligibility) nationwide as well as an exit-entry tracking system to prevent visa overstays. However, Trump dismissed the question of what to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, instead blaming the media: â€œIn recent days, the media â€“ as it usually does â€“ has missed the whole point on immigration,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAll the media wants to talk about is the 11 million or more people here illegally.â€\\x9d Mark Krikorian, a leading immigration hawk and head of the Center for Immigration Studies, bemoaned the fact that Trump has spent a â€œweek and a half meanderingâ€\\x9d on immigration. Krikorian, who has met with Trump on the issue, said this â€œwas especially absurd given that itâ€™s a core, key issue. Heâ€™s running as â€˜Mr Immigration Controlâ€™.â€\\x9d Krikorian told the he thought that Trump can only end up in the place where he actually started, â€œfocusing on enforcement tools like E-Verify and tracking for visa holdersâ€\\x9d. The vocal immigration hawk thought â€œthe question of what happens to illegal immigrants is secondary; [the] primary question is how we stop another 12 million people from coming here.â€\\x9d He noted that Trump was on record saying that some form of â€œamnestyâ€\\x9d would always happen but that â€œa politician has no business talking like that and thatâ€™s the one most important thing that I am looking to not see, is some kind of guarantee or commitment of amnesty.â€\\x9d But he said that he was far less concerned about the wall, which â€œas a policy matter is not that importantâ€\\x9d. In the meantime, those on the right worried about a rhetorical softening did find some comfort from an interview that Trumpâ€™s son, Donald Jr, gave to CNN on Tuesday, in which he said that his fatherâ€™s stance on undocumented immigrants was still the same and that all 11 million had to leave the country. But as longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone once said: â€œNo one speaks for Donald Trump but Donald Trump.â€\\x9d The Republican nominee is scheduled to give his immigration speech at 6pm local time at the Phoenix Convention Center on Wednesday.\",\n",
              "  \"Google denies 'Tories are/Labour are' autocomplete 'conspiracy theories' Google has categorically denied â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€\\x9d accusing it of censoring its search results to please the Conservative party in exchange for an agreement to pay just Â£130m in back taxes. The accusations stem from Googleâ€™s autocomplete function, which suggests search terms based on user input. The suggested searches are created algorithmically from previous searches on the topic. Users who enter â€œLabour areâ€\\x9d are offered completed terms including â€œâ€¦ finishedâ€\\x9d, â€œâ€¦ a jokeâ€\\x9d, and â€œâ€¦ right wingâ€\\x9d. Similarly, entering â€œLib Dems areâ€\\x9d offers up â€œâ€¦ finishedâ€\\x9d, â€œâ€¦ pointlessâ€\\x9d and â€œâ€¦ traitorsâ€\\x9d. But entering â€œConservatives areâ€\\x9d or â€œTories areâ€\\x9d offers no search suggestions at all. That prompted some to accuse Google of censoring its search terms to please the government. One reader, for instance, wrote to the paper to say that â€œin light of the recent tax scandal, it seems that the internet may be up for the right priceâ€\\x9d. Even the Daily Mail reported the conspiracy theories. A Google spokesperson told the that the company â€œcan categorically state that tax is not remotely connected to this, nor are their â€˜conspiracy theoriesâ€™ founded in any wayâ€\\x9d. Instead, Google said: â€œAutocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms.â€\\x9d So do searches for the Tories or Conservatives produce a different effect? Google offered a hint, saying: â€œWe do remove offensive or inappropriate content from autocomplete predictions.â€\\x9d Thereâ€™s even a web page where anyone can report offensive predictions. It could be that the search results for â€œTories areâ€\\x9d and â€œConservatives areâ€\\x9d were so bad that the terms were removed automatically because they were so offensive. A similar override occurs for searches including â€œChristians areâ€\\x9d, â€œJews areâ€\\x9d. Interestingly, â€œMuslims areâ€\\x9d offers just one autocomplete: â€œMuslims are not terroristsâ€\\x9d. Or it could be the case that the Conservatives are better at reporting offensive terms than Labour or the Liberal Democrats â€“ but a source close to the Conservative party told the it had not reported any offensive terms to Google. Meanwhile, other searches for the same party do autocomplete: â€œThe Conservative party isâ€\\x9d completes with â€œyour enemyâ€\\x9d. A search for â€œTory party isâ€\\x9d offers another part of the puzzle, autocompleting to â€œConservative party is badâ€\\x9d â€“ suggesting that Google treats the two terms as interchangeable.\",\n",
              "  'Conservative MPs start voting in leadership contest Conservative MPs have started voting in the contest to decide who will be their next party leader and the countryâ€™s prime minister, with Theresa May a clear frontrunner among her parliamentary colleagues. The politicians can cast a vote between 11am and 6pm, with the candidate securing the least support â€“ most likely to be Liam Fox â€“ being knocked out on Tuesday evening when the results are announced. Boris Johnson intensified the battle on Monday evening by throwing his weight behind Andrea Leadsom, who he said offered â€œthe zap, the drive, and the determinationâ€\\x9d that is needed to lead the country. The decision by the former London mayor to support the energy ministerâ€™s campaign is likely to draw more MPs to Leadsom, who is now the clear second favourite. â€œShe has long championed the needs of the most vulnerable in our society. She has a better understanding of finance than almost anyone else in parliament. She has considerable experience of government. She is level-headed, kind, trustworthy, approachable and the possessor of a good sense of humour,â€\\x9d said Johnson. The former London mayorâ€™s decision to back Leadsom, after his own hopes were scuppered by the last-minute decision of Michael Gove to abandon him and run himself, was described as â€œrevenge served coldâ€\\x9d by one MP. The dramatic events have put May well in the lead in parliament, with the public backing of well over 100 MPs, including 10 cabinet ministers, followed by Leadsom, with just under 40 MPs, and then Michael Gove and Stephen Crabb with over 20. The results will knock out the candidate with the least support, but others will then have until 9am on Wednesday to withdraw from the race if they believe that the first-round results are not strong enough to carry on. A second round will be carried out on Thursday, and a third session â€“ if necessary â€“ next Tuesday, with the final two candidates being put forward to a vote by the partyâ€™s grassroots members. On Monday night MPs in parliament were discussing who was most likely to come third between the justice secretary, Gove, and the work and pensions secretary, Crabb. Some were suggesting that Tuesdayâ€™s result could trigger tactical voting in the next round, as May supporters try to stop Leadsom from being put to the grassroots, after a ConservativeHome poll put the energy minister just ahead of the home secretary. Some worry about the backers that Leadsom has attracted from the right of the party â€“ with arch Eurosceptics such as Bill Cash, John Redwood and Bernard Jenkin all lining up behind her. It comes after May was forced on to the defensive over whether EU citizens would be able to remain in the UK, after Leadsom guaranteed the rights of more than 3 million migrants during a speech to launch her campaign. â€œWe must give them certainty; they will not be bargaining chips in our negotiations,â€\\x9d she said. Crabb and Gove have given similar assurances, as both sought to differentiate themselves from May. The home secretary responded at the start of a private Tory party hustings in parliament on Monday night by saying the issue would be dealt with in Brexit negotiations. She said she wanted to provide guarantees, but talks would also have to focus on protecting the rights of millions of British people living abroad. May told her partyâ€™s MPs that she wanted to take the issue head-on after a controversial session in parliament in which the immigration minister, James Brokenshire, faced criticism from Labour MPs and his partyâ€™s own benches as he laid out the government position. The hustings were followed by another session by the 2020 group of MPs, focused on how the Conservatives can secure a majority, who were able to watch each of the candidates in half-hour slots. There were also a number of Conservative MPs drinking in the House of Commons bars as many discussed how the leadership candidates had performed in the hustings. Some joked that Leadsom had lost them when she began to talk about â€œfrontal lobesâ€\\x9d and her â€œ3 Bs â€“ Brussels, banks and babiesâ€\\x9d. The reference was to the attachment theory between parents and newborns and the impact on brain development â€“ something she is passionate about. Many said Gove and Fox performed best but said May got the warmest reception and described Crabb as solid. Many also went to a karaoke session in parliament organised by the deputy leader of the house, Therese Coffey, where dozens of MPs sang a variety of songs including Mr Brightside, Mack the Knife and Summer Nights. All the leadership candidates turned up apart from Leadsom. Sources suggest Crabb sang a plea to MPs with â€œDonâ€™t Stop Me Nowâ€\\x9d.',\n",
              "  'Women taking pill more likely to be treated for depression, study finds Women who take the contraceptive pill are more likely to be treated for depression, according to a large study. Millions of women worldwide use hormonal contraceptives, and there have long been reports that they can affect mood. A research project was launched in Denmark to look at the scale of the problem, involving the medical records of more than a million women and adolescent girls. It found that those on the combined pill were 23% more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant by their doctor, most commonly in the first six months after starting on the pill. Women on the progestin-only pills, a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone, were 34% more likely to take antidepressants or get a first diagnosis of depression than those not on hormonal contraception. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Psychiatry, found that not only women taking pills but also those with implants, patches and intrauterine devices were affected. Adolescent girls appeared to be at highest risk. Those taking combined pills were 80% more likely and those on progestin-only pills more than twice as likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than their peers who were not on the pill. The researchers, Ã˜jvind Lidegaard of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues, point out that women are twice as likely to suffer from depression in their lifetime as men, though rates are equal before puberty. The fluctuating levels of the two female sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, have been implicated. Studies have suggested raised progesterone levels in particular may lower mood. The impact of low-dose hormonal contraception on mood and possibly depression has not been fully studied, the authors say. They used registry data in Denmark on more than a million women and adolescent girls aged between 15 and 34. They were followed up from 2000 until 2013 with an average follow-up of 6.4 years. The authors call for more studies to investigate this possible side-effect of the pill. Other scientists said the research should not put women off using hormonal contraception. Dr Channa Jayasena, a clinical senior lecturer in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, said: â€œThis study raises important questions about the pill. In over a million Danish women, depression was associated with contraceptive pill use. The study does not prove [and does not claim] that the pill plays any role in the development of depression. However, we know hormones play a hugely important role in regulating human behaviour. â€œGiven the enormous size of this study, further work is needed to see if these results can be repeated in other populations, and to determine possible biological mechanisms which might underlie any possible link between the pill and depression. Until then, women should not be deterred from taking the pill.â€\\x9d Dr Ali Kubba, a fellow of the faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, also said further research was needed. â€œThere is existing clinical evidence that hormonal contraception can impact some womenâ€™s moods, however, from this study there is no way of linking causation, therefore further research is needed to examine depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWomen should not be alarmed by this study as all women react differently to different methods of contraception. There are a variety of contraception methods on offer including the pill, implants, injections, intrauterine devices, and vaginal rings and we therefore advise women to discuss their options with a doctor, where they will discuss the possible side-effects and decisions around the most suitable method can be made jointly.â€\\x9d',\n",

              "  'Turkey fails to meet criteria for visa-free EU travel Turkey has missed an EU deadline that would have allowed its citizens visa-free travel through most of Europe, amid ongoing tensions over a controversial migration deal. EU leaders promised the Turkish government that 79 million Turks could have access to Europeâ€™s 26-country border-free Schengen travel zone by June, as part of a hotly disputed bargain on migration. But this was always conditional on Turkey meeting 72 EU conditions on border security and fundamental rights. The European commission announced on Wednesday that Turkey had still failed to meet some of the conditions, including changes to its counter-terrorism legislation. In a separate decision, EU ambassadors are expected to approve the opening of negotiations on one part of Turkish membership talks later on Wednesday. The decision to open talks on budget is a symbolic gesture that was promised under the migration deal. The prospect of Turkeyâ€™s membership of the EU has inflamed the UK EU referendum debate even though Turkey is unlikely to join for decades, if ever. The visa deal does not apply to the UK or Ireland, which are outside the EUâ€™s Schengen area. Since Turkeyâ€™s EU membership talks began in 2005, only one of the 35 â€œchaptersâ€\\x9d has been closed. Several are blocked over the countryâ€™s long-running dispute with Cyprus, while Turkey is seen by the EU as regressing on freedom of expression and the rule of law. The widely expected decision to delay the visa deal came one day after the EUâ€™s ambassador to Turkey resigned. HansjÃ¶rg Haber will leave his post as the EU ambassador to Turkey in August, after making provocative comments about the migration deal that infuriated the Turkish government. The German diplomat, who was only appointed last August, was accused of showing disrespect for Turkish national values and Turkeyâ€™s president, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan. Doubts about the visa deal have mounted ever since ErdoÄŸan ousted the prime minister who led negotiations with the EU. Turkeyâ€™s strongman leader has flatly rejected EU calls to rewrite his countryâ€™s anti-terrorism laws, saying: â€œWeâ€™ll go our way, you go yours.â€\\x9d In a statement the European commission said progress on the EU-Turkey deal was fragile. But Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner in charge of migration and visa policy, said he expected Turkey to meet the EU conditions on visa-free travel. â€œStatement diplomacy is not very helpful,â€\\x9d he said, adding that his talks with government officials at the highest possible level showed a strong will to cooperate with the EU. â€œI believe the migration crisis is bringing Turkey closer to Europe,â€\\x9d he said. He declined to specify when the deal could be agreed, muddying expectations that this might happen when the EU published its next progress report in September. Anxieties about visa-free travel in the EU have surfaced in several countries. A visa-free deal for Georgiaâ€™s 5 million citizens was put on hold last week, after last-minute opposition from France, Italy and Germany. The EU is also negotiating a visa-free travel deal with Ukraine. Governments, led by France and Germany, have insisted on an emergency brake that would allow them to halt the arrangement if there was abuse of the rules. Since the EU agreed the migration pact with Turkey in March, the number of migrants making the perilous journey to Greece has fallen sharply. Fewer than 50 people a day risked the dangerous Aegean Sea crossing in May on average, compared to daily arrivals of up to 2,000 at the start of the year. So far 511 Syrian refugees have been resettled in Europe from Turkey, under the one-for-one scheme. Around 462 migrants, including 31 Syrians, have been sent back to Turkey from Greece. The EU executive also called on Greece to take urgent steps to improve its asylum claims system, which fell foul of human rights standards even before a surge in arrivals on Greek beaches last year. Issuing a series of recommendations, it said Greece had to do more to ensure the safety of unaccompanied children and guarantee legal aid for claimants. But a senior human rights advocate at the Council of Europe said the EU-Turkey deal had created problems for Greece, which was struggling to cope with processing asylum claims. TomÃ¡Å¡ BoÄ\\x8dek, special representative on migration and refugees at the Council of Europe, said migrants and refugees were spending too long in overcrowded camps and asylum-processing â€œhotspotsâ€\\x9d in Greece while they awaited a decision on their claims. Around 50,000 people are on the Greek mainland, while a further 7,000-8,000 are estimated to be in camps on the Greek islands. The Council of Europe, which is not an EU body, has sharply criticised the EU-Turkey deal as a possible breach of international law. BoÄ\\x8dek, who served as the Czech Republicâ€™s ambassador to the EU, recently visited Turkey, which is housing 3.1 million refugees. Ahead of a report to be published later this summer, he voiced concern that half a million Syrian refugee children were not in school in Turkey. Many children were working in fields or textile factories to help support their families, he said. â€œIt would be difficult for any country to deal with this, but there are shortcomings, which are understandable because of this great number of refugees.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Australia's biggest banks pump billions into fossil fuels despite climate pledges Australiaâ€™s big four banks are continuing to finance fossil fuel projects despite embracing a 2C or better global warming target, according to figures from financial activists Market Forces. The Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank signed off on loans totalling $5.5bn to coal, oil, gas and liquefied natural gas projects in 2015, a figure that is higher than three of the preceding eight years. Among the deals were eight loans for coal projects signed in Australia in 2015, with a total value of $4bn, including for struggling Whitehaven Coal, operator of the controversial Maules Creek mine. All of the projects had some financing from the big four banks, with their contributions totalling $995m. â€œItâ€™s pretty much business as usual for the big four,â€\\x9d said Julien Vincent from Market Forces. It comes amid a series of dire warnings for the future of coal, with consumption declining in major economies such as the US and China. Last week, Goldman Sachs forecast that coal may be in terminal decline, with the fall in demand possibly being irreversible. All big four banks have made statements supporting a 2C target and they have acknowledged the need to play a role in achieving a shift away from fossil fuels. After the Paris climate accord of December 2015, Westpac went so far as saying it would take â€œconcrete action to ensure our lending and investing activities support an economy that limits global warming to less than two degreesâ€\\x9d. ANZâ€™s statement acknowledged worries that lending to fossil fuels was in conflict with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It committed to not lend to any new coal-fired power plants that didnâ€™t use high-quality coal. The data was collected from public announcements made by the banks since 2008 and shared with Australia by Market Forces. Vincent said it showed the banksâ€™ actions were not consistent with statements about climate change because continuing to exploit fossil fuels would blow the carbon budget, increasing warming beyond 2C. Among the $5.5bn of financing from the big four banks, there were 21 fossil fuel projects, including $300m for the struggling Whitehaven Coal, which had its loan refinanced by ANZ, Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank. Under the new terms, Whitehaven Coal was given a lower interest rate, despite its share price plummeting to a quarter of what it was when its controversial Maules Creek mine was first approved in July 2013. When the refinancing was announced last year, Whitehaven Coalâ€™s chief executive, Paul Flynn, was quoted in Fairfax Media trumpeting the support from the banks as a mark of confidence in the coal industry. â€œFor those who think the coal industry is part of the past, they may need to rethink their views, because that is certainly not the view of those who have just funded the deal,â€\\x9d Flynn said. â€œTo have all the major banks represented in our syndicate and for them to sign up again, on even better terms than what we had before, obviously their belief in our business and our industry is very strong.â€\\x9d Since that deal was announced less than a year ago, the companyâ€™s share price has fallen 65%. Tim Buckley, an analyst from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told Australia the banks immediately started trading the debt in secondary markets and lost 20% on it in the first few months. Buckley said the bad performance of that loan was an â€œa-ha momentâ€\\x9d for the banking industry. He said he was sure that next year similar analysis would show a drop in fossil fuel lending but not because of environmental concerns â€“ simply because they are realising fossil fuels are a bad bet. â€œThe financial markets have realised that [the Paris accord] was a massive aha-moment for everyone â€¦ They are saying, â€˜Look, we know that policy action globally is inevitable,â€\\x9d Buckley said. As a result they were beginning to be more cautious about financing fossil fuels and that would be reflected at the end of this year, he said. In response to the Market Forces figures, the big four banks all sent statements to Australia emphasising their lending to renewable energy projects. Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank provided links to some publicly available data on their exposure to the fossil fuel industry but it was not possible to compare the figures over time or against other banks. ANZ has similar data available. ANZ said that since 40% of the worldâ€™s energy comes from coal and it remains the cheapest fuel, a transition from coal needed to be â€œmanaged responsibly over timeâ€\\x9d. NAB said that, to secure Australiaâ€™s energy needs, renewable energy will play an increasing role but â€œfossil fuel will continue to be a major energy source for the foreseeable futureâ€\\x9d. The big four Australian banks were involved in 70% of the deals but were not alone in financing coal, gas and LNG projects. Their deals made up a quarter of the $22bn in loans to fossil fuel projects that were signed-off on in 2015 from both Australian and international banks. The biggest lenders to fossil fuel projects in Australia were Japanese banks, with three closing deals with combined values of between $2.2bn and $2.9bn in 2015, pushing the big four lower in list of top 10 lenders to fossil fuels. The figures do not give a complete picture of how much the banks are lending to fossil fuels overall â€“ their â€œexposureâ€\\x9d â€“ because many of the deals that were signed were refinancing, so are not necessarily increasing the amount of money lent to fossil fuel companies. Refinancing is a process where one loan is replaced with another under new terms. But Vincent said while banks were starting to become more transparent, they still did not provide enough information for shareholders and other stakeholders to calculate their overall exposure to fossil fuels over time and compare them. Vincent said that refinancing can also extend the length of a loan, or improve its terms, so refinanced deals are not always simply a continuation of the status quo. â€œAnd in light of statements supporting a move away from fossil fuels, banks could always choose not to refinance a loan,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThe Whitehaven deal is a good example. Any of the big four could have turned around and said â€˜all those activists climbing on your project and delaying it, and the decline in share price, itâ€™s just too hot to handle and weâ€™re going to exit thisâ€™.â€\\x9d â€œThe banks are desperate to stay in a position of business as usual. What this shows is an intent and a willingness to stay involved in the industry and to be exposed to it.â€\\x9d Vincent pointed out some banks have done exactly that on Abbot Point, leaving continuing doubts about whether the project could receive the loans it needs to proceed.\",\n",
              "  'Norwich City stand firm to leave Manchester City off the title pace Manchester City edged a point closer to Leicester City at the top of the Premier League table but this result surely represents ground lost by them in the title race. Rather than increase the pressure on the leaders, Manuel Pellegriniâ€™s side performed like men who should worry about being overtaken by West Ham or Manchester United in the top four. The would-be champions have not won back-to-back league games for five months and have a difficult run-in on top of a Champions League campaign that they aim to extend by seeing off Dynamo Kyiv in midweek. Norwich, meanwhile, can take heart from a point won with a spirited performance and their first clean sheet in more than two months. It could prove a springboard to survival. Manchester City have grown accustomed to beating Norwich heavily in recent seasons, including a 3-0 win here in the FA Cup in January, but this time, when only victory would have fuelled belief that they can topple the league leaders, they lacked creativity and sharpness. Norwich initially seemed there for the taking but emerged as deserving recipients of a point. The hostsâ€™ jitters, caused by a 10-match winless streak, served as an invitation to the visitors to make themselves at home again. Pellegriniâ€™s team hogged the ball but did not have the ingenuity to do much with it and were at times expensively sluggish. When Russell Martin headed an attempted clearance on to Sergio AgÃ¼ero in the fifth minute, the Argentina striker gave him enough time to recover and block the ensuing shot. And when Fernandinho produced a rare incisive pass in the 21st minute to put GaÃ«l Clichy clean through, the left-back miscontrolled and let the ball run out of play. By that stage, all that the home goalkeeper, John Ruddy, had done was awkwardly push a 20-yard free-kick by AgÃ¼ero over the bar. Not until the 29th minute did Ruddy have to excel, plunging quickly to his right to tip away a low drive from AgÃ¼ero with one hand. City could not make him perform such a feat again. That shot came against the run of play because Norwich, encouraged by the visitorsâ€™ impotence, had started to apply pressure at the other end. With Martin Olsson supplying regular crosses from the left, the Carrow Road crowd began to belt out hopeful chants. Patrick Bamford nearly brought ecstatic roars in the 39th minute when he outwitted NicolÃ¡s Otamendi and hit a half-volley over Joe Hart from 30 yards. There were exasperated yelps all round when the ball cannoned out off the crossbar. By first-half stoppage time, when Matt Jarvis shot just wide from 16 yards, the title-chasers were a slovenly bunch. David Silva flitted about purposefully but lacked zest and too few of his team-mates were on his wavelength in the first half. Wilfried Bony, again picked ahead of Kelechi Iheanacho, exerted no influence before being replaced by Raheem Sterling in the 58th minute. In the middle, there was a Yaya TourÃ©-shaped hole. The Ivorian has his flaws but boasts a creative menace that none of his team-mates provided in his absence. Manchester City started the second half with renewed urgency. That made Norwich defend with renewed nervousness, but no less commitment. Gary Oâ€™Neil and Jonny Howson were tirelessly vigilant in front of the back four. The visitors failed to penetrate. Just after the hour Silva, playing more centrally following Sterlingâ€™s introduction, spotted a run by Fernandinho and rewarded it with a beautiful pass. But the Brazilian eschewed a straightforward shot and offloaded to AgÃ¼ero, who bumbled before his shot was blocked. AgÃ¼ero sought to make amends moments later with a jagged run towards the box. Timm Klose took him down just outside, and the free-kick yielded nothing. â€œWe had a very good attitude and very good possession but we couldnâ€™t create the space that we needed in the last third,â€\\x9d said Pellegrini, who insisted his team could still be champions. â€œIf you mathematically have a chance to do it, you must always think you can do it.â€\\x9d Neil remains convinced that Norwich will get out of trouble. â€œThe amount of effort the players are putting in to stay in the league canâ€™t be questioned and our game management and our decision making was better than in recent weeks,â€\\x9d said the Scot, whose team will soon host the two sides closest to them in the table, Sunderland and a Newcastle United side whose illustrious new manager holds no fear for Neil. â€œRafael BenÃ\\xadtez isnâ€™t going to win the game for them, itâ€™s all about the players,â€\\x9d said the Scotsman.',\n",
              "  'Weak pound boosts UK manufacturing but import costs rise steeply Expansion in British factories slowed a little in October as the weak pound boosted exports but also pushed the prices of imports sharply higher. In the latest sign that consumers in the UK will face higher prices following the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, manufacturers raised the price of their goods at the fastest rate in more than five years. The latest Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI (purchasing managersâ€™ index) survey suggested that firms are starting to pass on higher import costs as the weak pound makes raw materials such as oil more expensive. However, the weak exchange rate also helped to boost orders from the US, the EU and China. The broader survey suggested the sector got off to a decent start in the fourth quarter. The headline index combining output, orders, and employment fell to 54.3 in October, from 55.5 in September, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, and an author of the report, said the manufacturing sector should return to growth in the fourth quarter, after shrinking by 1% in the third. He added: â€œOn the positive side, the boost to competitiveness [from the weak pound] drove new export order inflows higher, providing a key support to output volumes. The downside of the weaker currency is becoming increasingly evident, however, with increased import prices leading to one of the steepest rises in purchasing costs in the near 25-year survey history. â€œInflationary pressure was also experienced at the factory gate, with average selling prices rising at the steepest pace since mid-2011.â€\\x9d Capital Economics warned that the data suggested consumer prices would â€œpick up sharplyâ€\\x9d in the next few months. The UK economy has shown more resilience than expected since the EU referendum on 23 June. Official figures published last week showed the economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter between July and September. It was slower than the 0.7% growth in the second quarter, but stronger than economists expected and ruled out the possibility of a recession in the second half of 2016. A stronger-than-expected performance has fuelled expectations that the Bank of Englandâ€™s monetary policy committee (MPC) will refrain from cutting interest rates on Thursday, instead holding them at a record low of 0.25%. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said: â€œThe decent October manufacturing purchasing survey reinforces belief that the Bank of England will be sitting tight on monetary policy on Thursday after the November MPC meeting.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  \"Amber Heard sued for $10m over 'conspiracy' in London Fields promotion Another lawsuit has been filed over the film London Fields â€“ this time directed at actor Amber Heard. In the $10m suit filed by the filmâ€™s producers, Heard, who starred as Nicola Six in the adaptation of the 1989 Martin Amis novel, is alleged to have â€œbreached performance and promotional obligationsâ€\\x9d, the Hollywood Reporter wrote. The star-studded film features Heard as a psychic who foresees her own murder, alongside actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jim Sturgess, with a cameo by her former husband Johnny Depp. London Fields was slated to make its debut at the Toronto film festival last year before being removed from the festival lineup after reports emerged that director Matthew Cullen would sue the producers for fraud, claiming they were marketing the film using his name despite debuting a version that he had nothing to do with. His suit against Christopher Hanley and other producers complained that footage of â€œ9/11 jumpers edited against pornographyâ€\\x9d and a juxtaposition of â€œthe holiest city in Islam against mind-controlâ€\\x9d had been inserted into the film. The producers called the cancellation an â€œill-considered decision made against our rightsâ€\\x9d at the time. In a statement, Muse Productions said Cullen missed deadlines to submit a â€œdirectorâ€™s cutâ€\\x9d. Hanleyâ€™s Nicola Six Limited then filed a cross-complaint against Cullen. This latest suit is listed as â€œclosely relatedâ€\\x9d to that complaint, according to the 24-page document posted online by Deadline. The suit against Heard, filed in Los Angeles superior court, stated that â€œHeardâ€™s conspiracy, her campaign against the Picture, and her contractual breaches â€¦ have damaged the Picture, causing substantial harm to the Plaintiff, the Picture, and the Pictureâ€™s investorsâ€\\x9d. Among many claims, it alleged that she breached confidentiality obligations, failed to perform certain acting services and failed to comply with her publicity contract, according to the document. Later in the document, it states that her â€œmisguided and unlawful conspiratorial campaignâ€\\x9d against the film is ongoing. The film has received mostly poor reviews with the â€™s Henry Barnes calling it â€œawfully sillyâ€\\x9d.\",\n",
              "  'Local businesses will pay the price of Lloyds branch closures The news that Lloyds will be closing yet more branches will not come as much of a surprise given that almost two banks are closing their doors every single day and more than 1,500 communities no longer have access to even a single branch. There will be more bad news to come, and it will be local businesses and ordinary people in deprived areas that will pay the price as banking executives grapple with the costs of Brexit on top of Â£75bn in fines, compensation and legal expenses thanks to previous misdeeds. A bank closing its doors reduces SME lending growth in that area by 63% on average, rising to 104% when the branch in question is the last in town. The impact is hugely damaging to the local economy, especially as in nine out of 10 cases the banks that are closing are situated in areas where median household income is below the national average of Â£27,600. Move Your Money, a not-for-profit organisation that campaigns for ethical banking, has found that the closure of a bank branch sees lending to businesses in that postcode fall by Â£1.6m over the course of a year. This is a huge loss of investment in areas where unemployment is high and high streets are full of boarded up shop fronts. Over two-thirds of small business customers state that having access to a bank branch is important to them, and the importance of a high street branch stretches far beyond traders having somewhere to go to deposit their cash or nascent firms having ready access to capital. When a bank shuts up shop more often than not the cash machines disappear too and every local business in the vicinity suffers from the knock on effect. Despite the rise of chip and pin and contactless payment methods, cash still accounts for almost half of all high street sales and three-quarters of sales at newsagents and convenience stores. Furthermore, for every withdrawal from an ATM Â£16 â€“ amounting to Â£36bn a year â€“ is injected directly into local stores, meaning more than a third of total high street spending is directly reliant on easy access to a cash machine. Lloyds have not yet confirmed exactly which further branches will be closed, but in all likelihood it will branches in areas that are already struggling and can least afford to see the local economy atrophy in this way. The banking industry and the government will continue to point to the Access to Banking Protocol as evidence that the public interest and local communities are being protected when banks close branches. But the Access to Banking Protocol is not fit for purpose â€“ it is just window-dressing for the big banks and government alike to hide behind so it appears that they are doing something about branch closures. What is the point of consulting with local people and businesses once the decision has already been taken? A consultation can only be meaningful if it takes place in advance of any decision on closure. An independent review of the Access to Banking Protocol is currently under way, but unless the government wakes up and stops listening to the banking lobbyists before itâ€™s too late, the promises that will be inevitably made at every budget and autumn statement about supporting small businesses in this country should be taken with a large pinch of salt. In their advertising and marketing campaigns, the big banks are keen to position themselves as the friends of small businesses, but nothing could be further from the truth. To paraphrase Saint Teresa of Avila, if this is how banks treat their friends, it is no wonder they have so few.

              "  'Can we stop talking about our bushes now? Feminists are needed elsewhere How political are your pubes? Itâ€™s not a question most of us spend much time worrying about, yet when youâ€™re a woman, how you choose to cultivate your lady garden sprouts up as a topic with tedious regularity. In its latest incarnation, the arbiters at Tatler magazine have declared the â€œfreedom bushâ€\\x9d back in fashion (those who sneer at the notion of the pudenda being subject to changing aesthetic trends would do well to remember that dark mid-noughties period: the â€œvajazzle yearsâ€\\x9d). If even the conservative, conventional Sloane is cultivating a full bush then, itâ€™s worth noting, that could indeed hint at a seismic shift in societal norms regarding pubic grooming. But equally, after years and years of the same â€œdebateâ€\\x9d, is it not time that feminist coverage in the media was directed elsewhere? In other words, magazine editors, enough already. We are just emerging from a period that has seen a new generation embrace feminism in a way that the capitalist post-feminists of the 1990s could scarcely have imagined. Much of this has been powerful and positive: the conversation about the importance of sexual consent, for instance, and how it operates within a culture that continues to trivialise rape, has never been louder and more energetic. The fightback against street harassment has been equally inspirational. But at the same time a strand of feminism in the media has spent the last few years concerning itself with issues that many would dismiss as trivial, including pubes, and footwear, and 50 Shades of Grey, not to mention that perennial question that birthed a million op-eds: is BeyoncÃ© a feminist or not? As a writer, I have been guilty of entering into some of these debates. With an internet media run on opinion, feminist polemic can feel like one of the few journalistic avenues open to the young, aspiring woman writer (critiquing media sexism is how I began my own career, and I am grateful to it, but I have said my piece on womenâ€™s magazines). For a long while, talking about the more trivial aspects of the feminist debate â€“ as opposed to, for instance, boring old domestic violence â€“ was the only way to get feminism covered in the mainstream media. But as time has gone on, the focus on the fluffy â€“ so often to the point where it appears to be given equal billing to more urgent and distressing issues affecting women â€“ has irked me, and other feminists writers, more and more. Perhaps it is because I have been in this game for a while now, and have thus seen the same topics recycled several times over with very little new being said (my friend and colleague Emer Oâ€™Toole wrote the definitive piece on female body hair several years ago â€“ what could be left to say about it?). Or perhaps it is because I have grown up a tad in the past five years. But more than either of those two things, I would reason that this is a time when the need for feminism is making itself acutely obvious in all manner of ways. There is so very little to laugh about, to the point where even the notion of a â€œfreedom foofâ€\\x9d fails to raise a smile. Donald Trump, a man with so much obvious contempt for women that it feels almost unbelievable â€“ like watching a fictional dystopia play out on our TV screens â€“ is running for president. Analysis has shown that, if women were excluded and only US men were eligible to vote, Trump would win the election. It is abundantly clear that there are millions of people who would rather have a fascist than a female as leader. We are told that women can achieve anything in this day and age â€“ â€œso what are you whining about?â€\\x9d being the inevitable subtext. â€œLook at Hillary,â€\\x9d we are told, to which the inevitable rebuttal is: â€œYes, look at Hillary. Look at what she is up against.â€\\x9d There are other concerns, of course. The way the previous sexual behaviour of the complainant in the Ched Evans case was pored over during his successful appeal and in court this month has caused widespread dismay. Then thereâ€™s the closure of domestic violence shelters â€“ 17% have closed due to funding cuts, 32 of which were specialist services for black and ethnic minority women, and 48% of 167 domestic violence services in England said they were running services without any funding. Two women a week are murdered by their partners or ex-partners, and vulnerable women such as female asylum seekers continue to be abused. There were 99 pregnant women held in Yarlâ€™s Wood immigration removal centre last year. Three Serco workers are currently in court over the alleged rape of a Yarlâ€™s Wood detainee. As a recent report noted, the harassment and abuse of young girls in schools is endemic. I took part in a feminist debate this month, during which the broadcaster Jenni Murray recounted being turned down for a mortgage in the 1970s for no other reason than her gender; another speaker spoke about the murder of her friend at 18 by a boyfriend; and the DJ Clara Amfo expressed her frustration at being unable to articulate her anger about female oppression without being labelled an â€œangry black womanâ€\\x9d. I returned home depressed and tearful. Faced with these sobering facts, is it any wonder, really, that so many people seek refuge in arguing instead about bikini waxes? Iâ€™ve been to enough schools to talk to young women about feminism to know that feminist â€œfluffâ€\\x9d can be an easy way to open a discussion â€“ a â€œgateway drugâ€\\x9d if you will, for those unfamiliar with the topic, or put off or intimidated by the stereotypes surrounding it. Itâ€™s important that teenage girls particularly question why it is they feel pressured into certain sexual behaviours. That issue does not go away once you declare that the â€œfull bushâ€\\x9d is back. The impact of pornography on the way young people conduct relationships goes way beyond a few wax strips, taking in issues of consent, coercion and abuse, objectification, grooming and revenge porn. Itâ€™s all cheerful stuff. The personal is political, the feminists of the 1970s told us, and this has morphed into a strange kind of choice feminism where women are encouraged to examine their clothing, their footwear, their grooming, their behaviour, every little choice that they make, in order to assess whether it matches up. But the big picture is now so alarmingly vivid that it obscures these trivial questions. Freedom is never so easy to imagine as when it might be taken away. Most women know that our bushes have very little to do with it.',\n",
              "  'Rafael BenÃ\\xadtez exudes belief Newcastle can avoid relegation Rafael BenÃ\\xadtez says he finds mind games boring but the worrying thing for Sam Allardyce and Alex Neil is that, right now, he has no need to resort to them. Underpinned by a famously forensic eye for detail, the Spaniardâ€™s aura of calm, good-natured authority is transforming Newcastle United to the point where supporters of Allardyceâ€™s Sunderland and Neilâ€™s Norwich City are becoming unsettled. By simply being himself, BenÃ\\xadtez has not only galvanised his own team but planted seeds of doubt in the minds of both rivals. A combination of the Spaniardâ€™s grace under pressure and Newcastleâ€™s best Premier League run since 2014 has fuelled real hope on Tyneside that a team one and two points, respectively, ahead of the other contenders for the last two relegation spots can stay out of the bottom three. Considering Norwich and Sunderland have a game in hand, the odds remain against St Jamesâ€™ Park staging top-tier football next season but BenÃ\\xadtez retains the air of an experienced pilot quietly confident he can safely accomplish a high-risk landing on an icy runway buffeted by crosswinds. â€œItâ€™s not 100% in our hands,â€\\x9d acknowledged Newcastleâ€™s manager, who knows he needs another win at Aston Villa on Saturday. â€œBut weâ€™re going in the right direction, weâ€™re doing the right things, weâ€™re enjoying this challenge and weâ€™ll try and enjoy it until the end.â€\\x9d The fragility of such pleasure was emphasised by the nervous undercurrents rippling through a capacity crowd before the excellent Andros Townsend sent a sublime free-kick curving into the top corner. Indeed the tension would surely have become unbearable had Karl Darlow not subsequently dived low to his left and saved a Yohan Cabaye penalty that threatened to offer Crystal Palace a point. It was typical of BenÃ\\xadtez that, when Rob Elliot ruptured his cruciate ligament and joined the similarly injured Tim Krul in the treatment room, he refused to panic, instead simply stating how lucky Newcastle were to have such a good third-choice goalkeeper. Judging by Darlowâ€™s occasional, generally unconvincing, appearances under previous managers it seemed wishful thinking but, instead, the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper has been little short of brilliant. Granted his positioning and footwork may be a bit unorthodox at times but he has pulled off a series of fabulous saves â€“ on Saturday he repelled a difficult volley from Palaceâ€™s dangerous Yannick Bolasie and an awkward Cabaye shot â€“ as his team-mates have reacquainted themselves with the concept of hope. â€œThis is a big three points for us,â€\\x9d said Darlow, who was shocked to see the penalty awarded for what seemed a nonexistent handball against Moussa Sissoko. If it helped that Cabaye, widely booed by his once adoring former geordie public, struck his kick poorly, Darlow still performed heroics. â€œI just picked the way to go, dived hard and reacted to the ball,â€\\x9d he said, reflecting on a stop which could yet prove worth Â£100m to Newcastle. â€œIt was possibly the most valuable save Iâ€™ve made. It was one of those special moments that could keep us up. We do our research and look through everyoneâ€™s penalties before we play them and Cabaye had put his last four or five the other way. So it was just instinct.â€\\x9d Had fortune not frowned on Krul and Elliot, Darlow knows he would not even be warming the bench now so he appreciated it was imperative to take his unexpected chance. â€œI never had any doubt I could play at this level,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI just needed an opportunity but now I have to help make sure we stay up.â€\\x9d With Bolasie and Cabaye causing them all sorts of problems Newcastle did not start too well but, gradually, a series of players apparently reborn under BenÃ\\xadtez came to the fore. While Jamaal Lascelles highlighted his authority at centre-half with a fine, goal-preventing tackle on Connor Wickham, Cheik TiotÃ© made some important interceptions and the impressive Jack Colback began really imposing himself on central midfield. When Townsendâ€™s magnificent free kick arced over the wall, safety felt within reach. â€œIt wasnâ€™t an easy game,â€\\x9d said BenÃ\\xadtez. â€œWhen you see the size of Crystal Palaceâ€™s players you realise that, physically, theyâ€™re stronger than us so we couldnâ€™t win by just fighting. We had to play football and when we started to move the ball on the floor you could see the difference.â€\\x9d It was all so absorbing that, rather than proving provocatively divisive, Alan Pardewâ€™s presence on his first return to the club since leaving for Palace seemed almost irrelevant. â€œAlan was braced for a hostile one,â€\\x9d said his assistant, Keith Millen. â€œBut there was nothing. Newcastle fans realised they had bigger things to worry about.â€\\x9d Man of the match Karl Darlow (Newcastle United)',\n",

The disclosure was made on Monday as the bank reported a 1% rise in profits and a cut in the pay of its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, from Â£7.6m to Â£7.3m. Robin Hood Tax campaigners lobbying for what they argue is fairer taxation of the financial sector criticised the payouts. â€œIt may have been a bumpy year for HSBC, but that hasnâ€™t stopped the flow of bumper payouts. Many more millionaires made and Â£7.3m for the chief executive is hardly the picture of a reformed financial sector,â€\\x9d the group said. â€œThe banking sector is still completely out of sync with the rest of the economy. Itâ€™s in everyoneâ€™s interest that the UK has a more level playing field. The chancellor should take note.â€\\x9d The pay of non-executive directors â€“ almost all of whom receive more than Â£100,000 â€“ was disclosed. Rona Fairhead â€“ who chaired HSBCâ€™s audit committee at the time of the tax scandal in its Swiss arm â€“ is the highest paid non-executive, receiving Â£524,000, up from Â£513,000. Chair of the BBC Trust, Fairhead is leaving the HSBC board this year after chairing its US subsidiary. Jonathan Symonds, the former finance director of Novartis who chairs HSBCâ€™s European arm, received Â£521,000. Phillip Ameen, who chairs the audit committee and is member of the risk committee of the bankâ€™s US arm, received Â£416,000. A former director, Sandy Flockhart, who left in April 2012, also received Â£155,503 because of double taxation he incurred in Hong Kong and the UK. The bank is preparing to ask shareholders to approve a policy for its top management to incorporate a closer link to shareholder returns in the bonuses paid out through the three-year long-term incentive plan. Under new scheme rules, Gulliverâ€™s possible potential annual pay is being cut to Â£9.9m from up to Â£13m in the past. The minimum amount he can receive will be Â£3.3m, down from Â£3.5m, which includes a Â£1.25m salary, Â£1.7m fixed-pay allowance intended to shelter him from the EU cap on bonuses and a Â£625,000 pension contribution. That contribution is being cut from 50% of his salary to 30% in response to investor concerns. Gulliver also received Â£662,000 in benefits, largely to cover the cost of living in a property owned by the bank in Hong Kong. The bank said the introduction of UK rules that require bonuses to be deferred over seven years, rather than three, were more stringent than those in the EU, US and Asia-Pacific, â€œmaking it challenging for UK banks to attract talent with transferable skills or from other industriesâ€\\x9d. â€œWe believe more regulator coordination is required to ensure there are more globally consistent remuneration standards and a level playing field,â€\\x9d HSBC said.',\n",

              "  'Amma Asante: â€˜Iâ€™m here to disrupt expectationsâ€™ Amma Asante is drinking tea â€“ â€œIf you have PG Tips, all the better,â€\\x9d she calls to the retreating waiter â€“ in the plush quietness and gleaming surfaces of Londonâ€™s Cafe Royal. Despite traffic jams and torrential rain, she is impeccably calm, certainly calmer than many film-makers would be had their latest production been selected to open this yearâ€™s London film festival. But Asante, whose previous films A Way of Life and Belle garnered her high praise and multiple awards, including a Bafta, is clearly a star in the making â€“ and possibly also a star-maker; Gugu Mbatha-Raw, whom she cast in her breakthrough part as the title character in Belle, has just appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in the American civil war drama Free State of Jones. Earlier this year Asante was also invited to become a member of the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has had its biggest ever intake of new members following intense criticism over the lack of racial diversity in Oscar nominees. In joining a Hollywood club with a decades-long reputation for being largely white, male and aged over 50, sheâ€™ll now have voting rights on the Oscars, and a part to play in steering the industry and what comes to our screens in the future. For the moment, though, sheâ€™s concentrating on A United Kingdom, which had an unexpected â€“ and even inconvenient â€“ genesis. About 18 months ago, Asante was about to move not only home but also country, quitting the Netherlands, where she had lived for eight years, in favour of Denmark, where her husband is from. Amid all the upheaval and readjustment the phone rang. At the other end was actor David Oyelowo, whom Asante had known since they worked together on the BBC drama Brothers and Sisters back in 1998. Oyelowo, fresh from playing Martin Luther King in Selma, wanted to persuade her to be part of an idea whose moment had come â€“ â€œa labour of loveâ€\\x9d, as he described it. The project was to film the life of Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, the first prime minister of Botswana and his wife, an office clerk from Eltham. Their marriage, in 1948, when Botswana was still the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, had immense ramifications, both personal and political: Khama, who had met Williams at a missionary society dance in London, had been supposed to return from his stint at Balliol College, Oxford and subsequent studies for the bar to take up the kingship of the Bamangwato people. He was not supposed to return with a white, English bride, and particularly not just as neighbouring South Africa had made interracial marriage illegal under the apartheid system; her arrival angered both Bamangwato chiefs and many who couldnâ€™t believe that their future leader would choose an outsider above a local. Ruth Williamsâ€™s family also opposed the marriage, and there was vehement objection from the British government, enraged by what they saw as a dangerous misstep in managing regional relationships. Oyelowo had first come across Susan Williamsâ€™s book Colour Bar, on which the film is based, in 2010, through producers Justin Moore-Lewy and Charlie Mason, who had acquired the rights. Since then, the three had struggled to get the project, with Oyelowo playing Khama, off the ground. But the story of Khama, Williams and Bechuanalandâ€™s gradual journey towards independence immediately struck a chord with Asante, fresh from her success with the recently released Belle, which also drew on a complex piece of history to explore relationships across racial divides. Her father, she tells me, was a pan-African, a man who believed in a united states of Africa. â€œHe grew up in Ghana when it was still the Gold Coast; grew up, as my mother did, as the child of a colony, and watched it become independent. And Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence, so we always lived with that badge on our chest; I was always raised knowing that was the country that I came from. I grew up being able to repeat â€“ at seven or eight years old â€” the speeches of Kwame Nkrumah, who became the first president of Ghana.â€\\x9d Consequently, she explains, she was gripped not only by the fierceness and endurance of the romantic relationship at the heart of the story, but also by the intricacy and subtleties of its sociopolitical setting. Reading her way through Williamsâ€™s book â€“ itâ€™s brilliant, she says, but so dense with complex detail that she could only read 18 pages a day â€“ she realised that she wanted to explore how Khama came to a point where he could contemplate utterly changing the political landscape of his country. â€œEven though I didnâ€™t know the story,â€\\x9d she remarks, â€œI was very aware of the young, privileged men of Africa who moved through the UK in the 1940s, who were sent to be educated. I knew it because the women werenâ€™t.â€\\x9d What she didnâ€™t want, she explains, was to privilege one aspect of the drama over the other. And neither did she think it was necessary: â€œYou could create a very political backdrop against the love story. Because, really, what is interesting about being a black man married to a white woman today? Yes, in certain quarters, itâ€™s still difficult and there is still a taboo. But itâ€™s not that interesting â€“ why pick them, as opposed to any other interracial couple? Whatâ€™s really interesting is what happened once this couple chose to fall in love, the period in which they fell in love, which was right as South Africa was about to enshrine apartheid into its laws, and the fallout that occurs.â€\\x9d She notes â€“ while also acknowledging the earlier filmâ€™s vital importance at the time â€“ that A United Kingdom is not a rerun of Guess Whoâ€™s Coming to Dinner, the 1967 film in which a black man played by Sidney Poitier courts a white woman, to the consternation of her parents. Rather, she says, she had to find those things in the story that would resonate with contemporary issues. Among those is the issue of transition and identity. One facet of the story she focused on explores the idea that someone might be sent away at a formative age to experience life and education in another country and yet still be expected to return essentially unaltered; it also shows those at home, inching their way towards establishing nationhood in the face of societal change. I tell her that I was struck by the numerous interwoven stories of restriction and emancipation, and the different weight that history accorded them. Near the start of Asante and screenwriter Guy Hibbertâ€™s film, Khama and his wife, played by Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike, return to Bechuanaland and are met with hostility, despite his previous popularity; he determines to address the kgotla â€“ a public meeting â€“ and put his case. Scores of Bamangwato men, many of them dressed in suits, walk from their villages to attend, but there is barely a woman to be seen. Asante nods: she dotted a few around the edges, she remembers, as if to suggest that they couldnâ€™t help themselves from coming to listen, but there was a firm message that politics was not for women. And yet she knew that she had to represent the view of Bamangwato women. â€œWhen I first came to the script, the point of view of the black female wasnâ€™t really there, and it was very important,â€\\x9d she says. â€œI thought about my mother, I thought about my aunts; my mother was born and raised in a very rural village, but her brother is a chief. And the idea that he should go abroad and return, even with someone of the same colour but who was an outsider, and say, this is going to be your queen, I just imagined what their response would be. And there you have it, in the film.â€\\x9d Asante has had a lifetime of considering the nuances that attach themselves to the questions of identity and power informing her work. Now 47, she reckons that she is in a position to empower two sides of her identity â€“ her Ghanaian heritage and her British upbringing â€“ to be in dialogue with one another. â€œI allow that conversation to happen, and itâ€™s a pleasure,â€\\x9d she explains. â€œAnd I donâ€™t know what side Iâ€™ll come out on each day, or what decision Iâ€™ll come out with on each day, but it is a dynamic rather than a conflict.â€\\x9d Is she able to put into words what characterises these different parts of her? She mentions her pride in the traditions of her parentsâ€™ Ghanaian background, and of how important it is to her to be able to speak their language. â€œAnd yet, the very British side of me, who is the child of immigrants, is the side of me that welcomes outsiders â€“ the modern British side, that is â€“ and enjoys crossing boundaries and sharing boundaries and being open to what an outsider might bring. But Iâ€™m still deeply protective of my traditions at the same time.â€\\x9d (Amusingly, as we both ponder the miniature glass cloche covering the miniature biscuit that has accompanied tea, she puts her mild aversion to elaborate service down to her British â€œsideâ€\\x9d.) She grew up in Streatham, which she describes, in the early 1980s and beyond, as â€œa pretty racist environmentâ€\\x9d â€“ complete with graffiti on the walls and lit matches pushed through the letterbox. â€œThat was just a way of life,â€\\x9d she says now, inadvertently making reference to the title of her first feature film, â€œbut I was aware of the stress it put my parents through.â€\\x9d Her accountant fatherâ€™s response was to tell his family that there was one thing they had to remember at all times: â€œKnow that you are loved.â€\\x9d Fascinatingly, these exact words recur as a line in Belle (2013), the story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, the child of a British admiral and an African slave, who was brought to England by her father and left in the care of her great-uncle, Lord Mansfield; they are the words spoken to her by her father, whom she only knows for a few hours, as he bids her farewell. Even more poignantly, Asanteâ€™s father died during the filming of Belle, and she talks movingly about his impact on her work. She will always, she thinks, create benevolent fathers who are also flawed; hers, whom she describes as her hero, â€œmade mistakes, but when he got it right, he got it really rightâ€\\x9d. Belle grew up in Kenwood House in Hampstead, surrounded by great material privilege and familial love, but simultaneously excluded from vast swaths of society by the colour of her skin. As in A United Kingdom, there is a love story; but there is also a highly involved narrative that chronicles the changing legal position of slave cargo â€“ at heart, the degree to which slaves being transported at sea were regarded as human beings rather than mere possessions, to be jettisoned at the drop of a hat. Both elements of the film unite to portray a mixed-race woman growing in self-recognition and self-possession, and balancing the different claims made on her loyalties. Both movies also imply that a key moment in the journey towards selfhood is the acceptance that individuals contain multitudes. As a child, Asante began to act, and joined the cast of Grange Hill; she was part of the â€œJust Say Noâ€\\x9d campaign, and was one of nine cast members to visit Ronald Reaganâ€™s White House. But she would also develop lines to use in her off-screen life; for instance, she always used to reply â€œGhanaâ€\\x9d when asked where she was from, because â€œStreathamâ€\\x9d seemed to cause confusion of the â€œNo, where are you really from?â€\\x9d variety. â€œSo that became too complex,â€\\x9d she recalls, â€œand also it was a big fat rejection, because I actually felt as British as anybody else but I would constantly be reminded that I wasnâ€™t. And so it was easier to just say African.â€\\x9d But things changed somewhat when her debut, A Way of Life, was released. Set in Wales, the film tells the story of a young, single mother fighting extreme disadvantage, and also of her Turkish, Muslim neighbour. It started to get a little attention, and â€œquite often I would read about myself, and it would be, â€˜young British film-makerâ€™. And when you see words written about you, theyâ€™re very powerful.â€\\x9d Did she feel that, in a sense, she was being claimed? Yes, she replies, â€œbut there was a sense of, well, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been saying all along, but havenâ€™t been allowed to say. But thatâ€™s exactly what I am. Iâ€™m a young British director.â€\\x9d We talk more broadly about the issues of migration and the resistance to it that are bedevilling the world at the moment. Asante locates in much of the fear that surrounds the conversation an interesting insight into entitlement. â€œI often think about what we might look back at in 100 or 200 yearsâ€™ time from now and see as reallyâ€¦â€\\x9d â€“ she grasps for the word â€“ â€œprimitive. Because we fear, we really believe, there isnâ€™t enough to share, and there really isnâ€™t enough to go around, because thatâ€™s a narrative that weâ€™re given. But thatâ€™s because weâ€™ve decided that certain boundaries should exist and must exist, and you should stay over there, because the world over there is created for you, and the world over here is created for us. Well, thatâ€™s never worked.â€\\x9d At the time, she points out, change is always complicated, and when it happens too quickly, can be problematic. â€œYou canâ€™t have a country of fearful people,â€\\x9d she says, and in A United Kingdom, she is understanding of the competing demands on the Attlee and Churchill governments, both of which adopted problematic stances towards Bechuanaland as they sought to rebuild postwar British society. And yet, as she also says and the film makes clear, there was a good outcome: Seretse Khama took his country towards independence and democratic representation, and there it remains. She has already been criticised, she says, for making too much of a crowd-pleaser, to which she retorts that she canâ€™t change history. But does she think that underlying that attitude is an unfamiliarity, perhaps even tantamount to disbelief, with the business of telling an African success story? She nods vigorously. â€œThere was an argument over whether we should show some of the more beautiful images that we have in the film of Africa. This is why you need a person of colour at the table. Because I said, why not? Thatâ€™s the Africa I know. Hundreds of thousands of people travel to Botswana every single year to go and see the animal life there. Why would we pretend that that doesnâ€™t exist? Why wouldnâ€™t we show the beautiful sunsets? I remember waking up in my motherâ€™s African village to beautiful sunrises and beautiful sunsets. â€œWeâ€™re so used to seeing flies in African childrenâ€™s faces, weâ€™re so used to seeing what I call a degraded Africa, that does not have a person of colour at the centre of their own story â€“ theyâ€™re usually a supporting character whoâ€™s an observer of their own story â€“ that sometimes I think that when you see it told a different way, which means that you take a character like Rosamund Pike played in Ruth and flip the switch and make her the other, then it makes some people feel uncomfortable. Your expectations are disrupted. And I believe thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m here for. I hold that flag.â€\\x9d Asante is full of praise for Pike, who came to film after Gone Girl, and immediately embraced the no-makeup, frizzy hair and sensible shoes look that her character adopted when she moved to Botswana (there are rather more swinging skirts with nipped-in waists at the jazz clubs that feature in the filmâ€™s London scenes). â€œTo me, she embodied the courage that I imagined Ruth had,â€\\x9d she says. Particularly impressive was Pikeâ€™s insistence that she would simply drop to the ground during a scene in which Williams, suffering from diphtheria, collapses on a dusty road. Asante, worried about the numerous rocks in the path, had had sleepless nights wondering how they could conceal a mattress, but had to content herself with setting the crew to remove as many stones as they could. When one of Khama and Williamsâ€™s sons visited the set, he delivered the ultimate imprimatur: â€œItâ€™s not every day you see your mother and father come back to life.â€\\x9d Next, Asante is going to tackle the Nazis. Where Hands Touch, which she has written herself, will start filming in October, with The Hunger Gamesâ€™s Amandla Stenberg and Captain Fantasticâ€™s George MacKay starring as a teenage couple facing the not inconsiderable obstacle of his membership of the Hitler Youth and the fact that she is a mixed-race girl living in the Third Reich. Once again, issues of identity play an integral part, as does Asanteâ€™s abiding interest in capturing social and political structures at the moment where they begin to fall apart. We conclude by talking about broader issues of representation within the film industry, and specifically in the context of her recent membership of the Academy. How effective does she feel that development will be in promoting change and inclusion in the entertainment business? It is, she says, a â€œsubstantial and relevantâ€\\x9d move, and she commends the Academy for doing it. But she remains realistic: â€œWhen youâ€™re in it, it seems slow and it feels slow. When we look back in 100 years, who knows how it will look with hindsight. However, it does feel like weâ€™re turning a corner. Itâ€™s not a short corner, itâ€™s a very big bend, and weâ€™re some way around it and weâ€™ve still got a long way to go. Letâ€™s be really honest about this: the Oscars reflect the industry, so the Oscars can change but they can only do so much without the industry changing as well.â€\\x9d In other words the movies need to get made in the first place, so that audiences are not presented with eight identical films when they go to the multiplex. Cinemagoers, too, can play their part, choosing to see a more diverse range of films as they are released, and not necessarily waiting until they come out on DVD. â€œItâ€™s really interesting, â€œshe continues, â€œthat if you walk into an industry party and itâ€™s predominantly male, predominantly of a certain age, predominantly white, it starts to feel old-fashioned. It doesnâ€™t feel progressive. When you walk into a place and you see women, and you see people of colour, and varying abilities and disabilities, it feels like itâ€™s somehow a reflection of the world â€“ youâ€™re in the world, and that weâ€™re in a relevant industry.â€\\x9d She laughs, remembering her recent trip to a vibrant Toronto. â€œThat didnâ€™t mean to say that the lovely old white men were gone. They were still there!â€\\x9d The bottom line, she thinks, is that the industry needs to see a broadening of the wares as a business opportunity, not merely as a matter of morality: â€œIf you do not have a flourish of new lifeblood,â€\\x9d she says, â€œyou donâ€™t get a beautiful ocean, you get a dull, dank puddle.â€\\x9d A United Kingdom opens the London film festival on Wednesday and will be in cinemas from 25 November Race on screen: critic Jonathan Romneyâ€™s highlights from this yearâ€™s London film festival Chi-Raq Dir: Spike Lee The Greek comedy of Lysistrataâ€™s sex strike, adapted as the story of a Chicago woman who campaigns to stop gang war Spike Leeâ€™s most acclaimed film for ages â€“ a jovial yet impassioned musical strike against violence within black communities. Angela Bassett, Wesley Snipes and Samuel L Jackson join newcomer Teyonah Parris in an uproarious slice of hip-hop Brecht. Daughters of the Dust Dir: Julie Dash An evocation of a community of island-dwelling African American women in 1902 Now restored, Julie Dashâ€™s 1991 debut feature opened up a new direction in independent US cinema that has never been followed up. Fusing black history, costume drama and a vision of feminist utopia, this dream-like film was one of the inspirations for BeyoncÃ©â€™s Lemonade visuals. The Birth of a Nation Dir: Nate Parker The story of Nat Turner, a preacher who led a slave revolt in Virginia in the 1830s A Sundance-winning debut from actor turned writer-director Nate Parker. It polemically appropriates the title of DW Griffithâ€™s 1915 film â€“ a classic forever identified with American racism, against which Parker boldly takes up the cudgels. Divines Dir: Houda Benyamina A young woman from the Paris banlieue hustles to survive, while getting emotionally entangled with a male breakdancer The debut from French director Houda Benyamina, inspired by her experiences of the 2005 Paris riots, was one of this yearâ€™s Cannes breakout titles. Anarchic, ferociously energetic and joyously flouting the sexual stereotypes of hood drama, it introduces the explosively talented Oulaya Amamra as heroine Dounia. Hissein HabrÃ©, A Chadian Tragedy Dir: Mahamat-Saleh Haroun The former president of Chad prepares to stand trial for the crimes of his regime Mahamat-Saleh Haroun is one of the foremost contemporary African directors, his dramas including Abouna and A Screaming Man.

              "  'Co-op chief is leading the way in executive pay restraint We like to say we do things differently at the Co-op. Well, last week we proved it. On a morning when the Co-op reported growing profits and growing investment, including in frontline pay for colleagues, our chief executive Richard Pennycook also announced he was taking a voluntary pay cut. A total of 60% across base pay and bonus. Thatâ€™s not the way CEOs usually behave. Normally, more profit leads to higher pay (at least for top execs). It was a little disappointing, therefore, to see your article (Co-op boss will take 60% pay cut â€“ but not until next year, 8 April) focusing on the fact that some elements of the cut to bonus wonâ€™t come in to effect until 2017. The has always beaten the fair pay drum loudly, holding those in positions of power across business and politics to account when it comes to what they are paid. And rightly so. With the gap between the UKâ€™s poorest and the richest growing each year, people understandably want to know that pay and rewards for business leaders are justified. Richard may well have scandalised some of his opposite numbers in the PLC world by his announcement. But if he has that would be a good thing. Iâ€™d like to think that the Co-op may just have sparked the beginning of a change in attitude towards executive pay, and I believe the should be right behind us.

              "  'Plenty of reasons for a second EU referendum Rafael Behr (Opinion, 21 September) and senior Liberal Democrats who question the wisdom of Tim Farronâ€™s commitment to a second referendum once the terms of Brexit are settled, assume present attitudes will persist. They ignore the likelihood that negotiations will end in â€œa hard Brexitâ€\\x9d. Continued membership of the single market and of the EU customs union is the least likely outcome. Outside both, the prospect of an easy conclusion of favourable new free trade agreements (FTAs) with the rest of the world is a pipe dream. We would not only need a new FTA with the EU, likely to be a protracted negotiation as it has to be agreed by all 27 members, but also with some 50 countries with which the EU now has FTAs, as well as those with which it is now negotiating, principally China and the US. We would also have to re-enter the World Trade Organisation, which involves making a number of commitments that have to be approved by all 164 WTO members. Londonâ€™s survival as the financial centre of Europe would also be in doubt. Outside the single market financial institutions would be unlikely to obtain the passports they need for doing business in the single market. The obstacles to a swift solution that would benefit our world trade are numerous and formidable. The likely result within a few years is a â€œBrexit recessionâ€\\x9d, caused by reduced foreign investment, even disinvestment, by those who once saw Britain as the gateway to the single market â€“ Japanese carmakers, for example â€“ as well as an exodus of British companies to the continent. By the time negotiations conclude, there is likely to be a major shift in public opinion against our leaving the EU. Dick Taverne House of Lords â€¢ Polly Toynbee (Get serious, Labour rebels, your country needs you, 20 September) makes the valid point that these 172 MPs should be standard bearers for the nationâ€™s pro-EU 48%. In this context, I think it should also be borne in mind that less than 35% of the electorate voted for Brexit. Surely our elected representatives must take account of the 65% who, for whatever reasons, did not vote for the UK to leave the EU. It is another good reason for parliament, and not solely the prime minister, to decide whether to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.

              "  'Twitter acquires AI startup Magic Pony for a reported $150m Twitter has bought London-based AI startup Magic Pony Technology for a reported $150m (Â£102m) as the company moves to strengthen its position in image-sharing, video and live video. Founded in 2014, Magic Pony uses machine learning to build improved systems for visual processing. The company said it was excited to be joining forces with Twitter â€œto improve the visual experiences that are delivered across their appsâ€\\x9d. Twitterâ€™s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said Magic Ponyâ€™s technology would be used to enhance live and video offerings and â€œopens up a whole lot of exciting creative possibilities for Twitterâ€\\x9d. Dorsey said the team included â€œ11 PhDs with expertise across computer vision, machine learning, high-performance computing and computational neuroscienceâ€\\x9d. By teaching a neural network what certain types of images are like, Magic Ponyâ€™s systems can restore lost information to blurry pictures, or create new visuals from scratch. In demonstrations of its technology in April, Magic Pony showed one system that could â€œrestoreâ€\\x9d a realistic face from the pixelated visage of the main character of Doom, and another that could automatically generate a brick-and-plaster wall from a small image. Many of the companyâ€™s advantages over competitors come from its speed and efficiency. While big companies such as Google and Adobe have image-processing technology that can pull off many of the same feats, Magic Pony says it targets â€œdesktop, mobile and webâ€\\x9d, and has demonstrated some of its systems running on video, live. Twitter could build the technology into its app to improve the quality of streamed video or use it as a form of ersatz image compression. Magic Ponyâ€™s cofounder, Rob Bishop, told MIT Technology Review in April that â€œonline video-streaming businesses rely heavily on video compression. Our first product demonstrates that image quality can be greatly enhanced using deep learning, and fast mobile GPUs now allow us to deploy it anywhere.â€\\x9d Bishop was the first engineering employee at Raspberry Pi. He and his cofounder, Zehan Wang, met at London-based startup accelerator Entrepreneur First. Magic Ponyâ€™s investors highlighted the acquisition as further evidence of the UKâ€™s lead in AI. â€œThe UK continues to grow as the â€˜go-toâ€™ place for companies looking to build best in breed AI technology,â€\\x9d said Luke Hakes of Octopus Ventures. Suranga Chandratillake of Balderton Capital added: â€œWe are delighted that an iconic west coast company has once again recognised that Europe is right at the forefront of the AI revolution.â€\\x9d London-based DeepMind sparked an AI boom when it was acquired by Google in January 2014 for more than $500m. The company has since built the first software capable of beating a professional human player at the ancient Asian board game Go, a victory long considered impossible by AI experts.',\n",
              "  'Miss Hokusai review â€“ artist anime blends the sentimental, erotic and strange Katsushika Hokusai is the Japanese artist whose famous work is The Great Wave Off Kanagawa (1830): an elegant and mysterious vision of a huge wave in mid-break, droplets of spray fixed like icicles, endlessly reproduced on T-shirts, posters, etc. This interesting and unexpectedly complex anime, based on Hinako Sugiuraâ€™s manga series Sarusaberi, or Crape Myrtle, is about Hokusaiâ€™s daughter and assistant O-Ei, voiced by Anne Watanabe. The movie persuasively speculates that she was effectively his collaborator and artistic co-creator, and the film combines the sentimental, the erotic and the simply strange. Father and daughter here have a very frank attitude to their lucrative erotica output, and there are intriguing leftfield moments, such as a visit to a courtesan, who is tricked into revealing her mystical ability to let her head float away from her neck. O-Ei has a bizarre vision of a giant Buddha appearing in the sky and letting its great foot stamp on her. There is a nod to the famous wave. It is an interesting work, delicately and discreetly animated, with a quiet visual coup in its final moments when the Edo (as it was then called) of 1814 is dreamily replaced by the Tokyo of the 21st century.',\n",
              "  'X-Men: Apocalypse review â€“ lots of bangs for your bucks but loopiness is lost A gallery of mutants from generations old and new is spread across Marvelâ€™s hyperactive and excitable new X-Men movie, directed by Bryan Singer, which seems to absorb ideas of occult resurgence and mythic confrontation from films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars. Now the mutants have to battle the ur-mutant, the first mutant of all, the ancient Egyptian potentate En Sabah Nur, smaller and more human-sized than in the comics and played with massive impassivity by Oscar Isaac. En Sabah Nur returns to Earth with the intention of destroying this wicked world and all its vanities before building it anew. The epicentre of his kingdom in Cairo is a colossal new pyramid with a distinctive filigree design, a little like the World Trade Center. The movie builds to the regulation city-smashing finale, with gravity suspended for the resulting debris and masonry fragments. The internal motor of this episode is kept turning over by a handful of very lively set-pieces, although it isnâ€™t an obvious advance on the previous film, X-Men: Days of Future Past, which was more dizzyingly complex and strange. It does not have the same cerebral loopiness; thereâ€™s not enough for Jennifer Lawrence to do as Raven and the film ungallantly drops Famke Janssen as Jean Grey in favour of casting a younger actor, Sophie Turner â€” while keeping a certain comparably senior male star in place. But it keeps the fireworks firing and incidentally explains how Dr Xavier (James McAvoy) lost his hair, and itâ€™s nothing so banal as male pattern baldness. We are now around a decade on from the last movie, which gave us the mutantsâ€™ first appearance in the age of Nixon and which ended in an assassination attempt from Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Now we are in the conservative 1980s: there is a glimpse of Ronald Reaganâ€™s photograph on the wall of the CIA office and even a bit of William F Buckley on a TV news clip. Mutants are existing underground: Raven (Lawrence) is hiding out in East Berlin â€“ somehow movies set in this period never happen in the boring old prosperous West Berlin â€“ where she discovers and liberates a mutant, Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Magneto himself is incognito in Poland, working in a factory and he now has a wife and child. You might think these domestic encumbrances are going to be pretty inconvenient if he is going to resume his mutant vocation. And you would be right. Meanwhile, Dr Xavier is still running his palatial school for gifted children which soon becomes home to a startling new star student, high-schooler Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) â€“ otherwise known as Cyclops. Scott is subject to excruciating pain in his eyes which torments him until he realises that these are weapons of mass destruction, and he demonstrates these powers in Dr Xavierâ€™s grounds in a very entertaining sequence. The narrative is kicked into action when Magnetoâ€™s cover in Poland is blown, and he gets on the TV news, where is recognised by Quicksilver â€“another very entertaining turn from Evan Peters â€“ who turns up at the school intending to help, just as En Sabah Nur arrives with his hideous sub-Biblical entourage of mutant helpers, seeking to appropriate Dr Xavierâ€™s entire mental universe and recruit everyone to the dark side who wants to join. Fans of DOFP will be looking for a followup to the now classic frozen-time sequence in which Quicksilver dashed around the place, plucking bullets out of the air and putting people in silly positions â€“ and all to the haunting accompaniment of Jim Croceâ€™s Time in a Bottle. Now he does the same thing as Eurythmics play Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). Itâ€™s amusing, but not quite the showstopper it was the last time â€“ and the returns are diminishing for this routine. Boldly, Singer reprises one of the most startling aspects of the first X-Men movie from 2000: Magneto is briefly returned to Auschwitz, where his parents perished, and invoked as a touchstone of the kind of pure evil which will destroy humanity. In a movie with less artless and forthright vehemence, and one with greater pretensions to middlebrow good taste, this could hardly have worked, but Singer brings it off here, just about. The idea of an apocalypse means every dial has to be turned up to 11 and this film certainly provides bangs for your buck, although there is less space for the surreal strangeness of the X-Men to breathe, less dialogue interest, and they do not have the looser, wittier joy of the Avengers. But the more playful episodes with Cyclops and Quicksilver are welcome and everything hangs together. But in the future X-Men films have to mutate into something with fewer characters and more characterisation.',\n",
              "  'RBS, Barclays and other banks fined in Swiss franc Libor case Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are among banks hit with SFr99m (Â£78m) of fines by the Swiss competition regulator for operating four separate cartels, as the international fallout from the Libor rate-rigging scandal spreads. The two British lenders were hit with a combined Â£37m in fines, while HSBC, Lloyds and City of London brokers Icap, Tullett Prebon and RP Martin all remain under investigation by Switzerlandâ€™s competition commission, Comco. Barclays was fined Â£23.5m by Comco for colluding to influence interest rate derivatives by manipulating Euribor, used for euro loans between banks. The British lender was found to have participated in cartel behaviour over 32 months, while RBS was fined Â£9.7m for eight months of participation. Proceedings against a slew of other banks including HSBC are ongoing, while Deutsche Bank received immunity for blowing the whistle on the cartel. â€œThe cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for interest rate derivatives in euro,â€\\x9d said Comco. â€œTraders of different banks occasionally discussed their bankâ€™s submissions for the calculation of the Euribor as well as their trading and pricing strategies.â€\\x9d The probe also saw Franceâ€™s SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale fined Â£2.6m, while proceedings remain open against JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Rabobank. RBS was granted immunity in a separate probe into collusion with JP Morgan to influence the Swiss franc version of the Libor interest rate, after it told regulators of the activity. Comco fined JP Morgan Â£27m after concluding that the two banks had operated a â€œbilateral cartelâ€\\x9d between March 2008 and July 2009, with the aim of influencing the benchmark rate. RBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to Comco, while JP Morgan had its fine reduced after cooperating with the regulatorâ€™s inquiries. A third probe into yen Libor rates saw the regulator hand out Â£11.3m of fines, including a Â£3m penalty for RBS, for manipulation that took place between 2007 and 2010. The proceedings continue against banks including HSBC and Lloyds, while Icap, RP Martin and Tullett Prebon were also named as being subject to ongoing scrutiny, along with Rabobank and UBS. A final probe into the spread on Swiss franc interest rate derivatives resulted in Â£4.25m of fines, including just Â£670,000 for RBS, after its penalty was reduced for cooperation with the regulator. The scale of the Swiss regulatorâ€™s penalties pale in comparison to those dished out by European competition authorities earlier this month. Three major banks â€“ including HSBC â€“ were fined â‚¬485m (Â£412m) for colluding to manipulate the crucial Euribor benchmark rate, after a five-year investigation. The trio had chosen not to take part in an earlier settlement that included RBS and Barclays. The rate-rigging scandal has seen banks hit with hundreds of millions of pounds in fines from a variety of regulators, while bankers from Barclays and UBS have been jailed.',\n",
              "  'Brexit could force multibillion-pound projects to be scrapped, says NAO chief Billions of poundsâ€™ worth of public projects will have to be scrapped by Theresa May because of a â€œtidal waveâ€\\x9d of pressures from an impending Brexit, the head of Whitehallâ€™s official spending watchdog has said. The comptroller and auditor general of the National Audit Office, Sir Amyas Morse, said the government would have to treat leaving the EU as an â€œemergencyâ€\\x9d and that government departments would be forced to decide which plans could be cancelled or suspended. Major projects such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, a third runway at Heathrow and the ambitious HS2 rail project would have to be reassessed as the government decides which can be done without, he told the . Others which will be re-examined include the Â£7bn refurbishment of the Palace of Westminster, the London commuter line Crossrail 2 and former chancellor George Osborneâ€™s northern powerhouse strategy. Britainâ€™s most senior auditor gave his alarming verdict on Whitehallâ€™s readiness as the prime minister comes under increasing pressure from European leaders to start talks on the UKâ€™s exit from the EU as soon as possible. â€œItâ€™s a tidal wave coming up the beach,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIt is an emergency. If we donâ€™t get it right, it will affect our economy and standards of life in this country. To say we are going to carry on and do everything we did before â€“ I just donâ€™t think thatâ€™s going to be sustainable.â€\\x9d â€œWe probably wonâ€™t face something like this again. You can truly use the word emergency about getting a Brexit right,â€\\x9d he said. Morse, the governmentâ€™s chief auditor who has a statutory responsibility to scrutinise all public spending, has spoken out in a rare interview â€“ a reflection of his concern that there is little time to waste. He warned that the UKâ€™s decision to leave the EU would mean government resources, including civil servants, IT professionals and legal advisers, being directed towards managing Brexit and therefore away from delivering major infrastructure projects. Aiming his words at Downing Street, he said that government departments must be forced to reduce their commitments to major projects, which are valued at Â£405bn, because some government departments are facing cuts of up to 40%. â€œWe need to ask ourselves, can the public sector deliver Hinkley Point C, a third runway, HS2, a northern powerhouse, nuclear decommissioning, Trident renewal and restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster all at the same time? â€œAll these projects are drawing on the same pool of skills and many of these contain optimism bias that they will be able to meet their skill needs at an appropriate cost,â€\\x9d he said, while declining to speculate on which should be scrapped. â€œYou are going to have to rein in projects â€¦ and say, what is the benefit? How damaging is it not to have it for a period of time? Can we afford it?â€\\x9d he said. â€œThere is a policy at the moment to have lots of infrastructure projects. I say fine, but some of them will have very big consequences in terms of your ability to deliver your other goals.â€\\x9d A Brexit would mean that other government activity would inevitably have to be curtailed, but there was a danger of it being left too late. Morse said the initiative to cancel projects quickly had to come from Downing Street. â€œI think that a lot of this will happen anyway as the [Brexit] plans build up,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut it [would be] so much better if it happens facing forward and the government takes a grip of it rather than saying: â€˜You know, we have been overtaken by events and now we are rushing around arbitrarily stopping things,â€™ which could be chaotic and costly.â€\\x9d Morse said each government department will have to conduct a â€œstocktakeâ€\\x9d to ensure that Whitehall has the capacity and the public money to deal with the challenges of extracting Britain from the EU. â€œEverything from EU science research funding to aviation policy to fisheries policy will need to be looked at and new systems and business operations put into place to fill the gap left by the EU,â€\\x9d he said. He added: â€œBrexit means lots of additional work for departments. We really have to create some capacity to be able to handle that surge in demand.â€\\x9d The challenge of a Brexit also has to be completed in the face of large-scale staff cuts across Whitehall, he added. â€œThis is while the budgets for most departments have [been subjected to] very aggressive reductions. In the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills there is a reduction of central costs, I think, of 40%,â€\\x9d he said. He said a â€œdigital capability gapâ€\\x9d meant that even before Brexit the government needed to find about 2,800 new staff with IT skills to undertake projects already planned over the next five years. This gap, it has been estimated by the NAO, would cost Â£213m to fill with full-time civil servants and Â£418m if the work was handed to contractors. Ministerial ambition also made it hard for the government to think rationally about which projects were â€œmust haveâ€\\x9d and which were â€œwould likeâ€\\x9d and expendable, he said. â€œIt comes partly from the natural enthusiasm of ministers who want to announce major initiatives and a natural enthusiasm of civil servants to be seen as â€˜can doâ€™,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIt is not a very attractive prospect for a minister to stand up and say: â€˜Well, I havenâ€™t really initiated anything in my time at this ministry but I have done a very prudent job managing the projects inherited from my predecessor and, by the way, when I retire, someone else will be able to see the completion of these projects and get the credit.â€™ These are not criticisms of any particular government, this is just how it is.â€\\x9d He also warned that the government should also prepare for a possible â€œScotxitâ€\\x9d, given that Scotland voted to stay in the EU, which could be even trickier than a deal with the EU. â€œThat will be a negotiation you will be able to see from the moon,â€\\x9d he said.',\n",
              "  'The game improving a communityâ€™s health without them noticing It is drizzling and cold in Salford, but a class of eight- and nine-year-olds from Lewis Street school in Patricroft are buzzing as their teachers lead them down the streets of terraced houses between classes. They stride through a park, dodging an abandoned car seat, to swipe lanyards against three street sensors before returning to lessons. Itâ€™s called â€œgoing fobbingâ€\\x9d in Salford â€“ walking or cycling to sensors on lampposts all round the city and swiping them to get points. Itâ€™s part of a health and community building scheme called Beat The Street (BTS) and itâ€™s taken Lewis Street by storm. Pupils and parents have travelled 3,288 miles (scoring a mighty 66,490 points) on fobbing expeditions over two months to outwalk all Salfordâ€™s other 23 participating schools and 13 community groups. Patricroft is a struggling area, where unemployment is high and the number of people describing their health as bad or very bad is well above the national average. But thereâ€™s a clear sense of purpose here as the warmly wrapped youngsters line up to swipe their fobs near the school. â€œI did all the 50 fobs in three days over half term,â€\\x9d says one little girl excitedly. Her teacher reveals that this previously inactive child now goes to an after-school sports club almost every night of the week. The school has undergone a mini revolution. A detailed and constantly changing online content plan, social media and incentives such as tickets to local amenities, keep the players engaged â€“ not to mention the sense of competition. Rachael Hall, the schoolâ€™s sports coach, says: â€œIâ€™ve never known anything like it â€“ children are going out walking every evening and weekend. Teaching assistants take the children out at lunchtime three times a week and take whole classes out twice a week. Iâ€™ve had parents telling me how happy they are to be spending time with their children going fobbing rather than sitting in front of the TV.â€\\x9d She says a little boy with cerebral palsy with walking problems has made big progress because of the peer pressure to participate in BTS. Another pupil has become so fascinated by the project that he has taken to writing down where he has been, which has improved his school work. This is exactly what Beat the Street founder and Reading GP, Dr William Bird is after â€“ galvanising whole communities, with the health message almost a side issue. He says: â€œI want to get the whole of the UK walking, starting with the cities where it is easiest. Walking creates vibrancy â€“ take it away and you create a flat and dying city full of underpasses where no one wants to go.â€\\x9d Intelligent Health, which Dr Bird set up to operate BTS, works by turning a town or community into a game where people of all ages earn points by walking, cycling or running between sensors placed on lampposts. In the process, no-go areas are opened up to pedestrians, people have fun together and develop healthier habits. Jennifer Dodd-Power, engagement manager for BTS in Salford, has convinced 5,500 people to take part so far â€“ (though not a patch on Belfast which boasted 36,000 players). She says: â€œPeople are not seeing BTS as exercise but as a fun way of going out with the family. We are not saying to people â€˜go and join a gym or get yourself to an exercise classâ€™ we are saying â€˜go out and meet your friendsâ€™.â€\\x9d Part of her work has been to link fobbing with community events â€“ such as the Eccles Makers Market â€“ where BTS participants could gain extra points on the day of the event at a temporary sensor set up nearby. The two-month games are preceded by three monthsâ€™ community engagement, where people such as Dodd work with GPs, local NHS organisations, community groups, sports clubs and schools to build up the enthusiasm. Then the activities requested by a community are set up, whether that be women-only bike riding classes in Asian-dominated Handsworth in Birmingham, or just the incentive to walk into town for previously immobile elderly members of Banham Drive, Sudbury. There elderly residents walked more than 1,500 miles together and have now set up organised walks. BTS is proving successful in health terms according to results from 53,000 participants. During the game phase the proportion of adults meeting the physical activity guidelines increased from 46% to 57% and the percentage of adults reported walking on five to seven days per week increased from 47% to 61%. Government research shows that those who fulfil the recommendation of 150 minutes per week of exercise will improve 23 different long-term conditions including diabetes and dementia, reduce the risk of developing several cancers and even stimulate the brain chemicals that reverse ageing, says Bird. Intelligent Healthâ€™s research shows that people are put off by the NHSâ€™s health messages, because they feel they are being lectured. So the year-long health programmes targeting areas of deprivation put the emphasis on enjoying activity with others â€“ and last year 175,198 people travelled more than 1.5m miles with BTS in 21 areas. The scheme is not working for everyone, though. Head of Lewis Street School, Gemma Lavelle, says: â€œEven though BTS has raised our activity levels we know that some parents have not signed up. What do we have to do to get some of the really hard-to-reach families involved?â€\\x9d Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

              "  'Robbie Williams: The Heavy Entertainment Show review â€“ cheek, swagger and schmaltz â€œLight entertainment, but on steroidsâ€\\x9d is how Robbie Williams conceived his 11th solo album, a record that reunites the singer with writer Guy Chambers, co-author of umpteen smash hits from the Robbie back catalogue, on a new label. Chambers returned for 2013â€™s Swings Both Ways, but that was all dicky bows and pomade. This is supposed to be a pop event â€“ a sort of Lady Gaga reunites with RedOne situation â€“ in which Williams redeploys the particular combination of cheek, imperiousness and schmaltz that saw him boss the late 90s and early 00s. Thatâ€™s probably not how Heavy Entertainment will play out, exactly. Itâ€™s hard to pinpoint where this album fits in the shifting-sand ecology of contemporary pop. Perhaps wisely, Williams opts out of current sounds such as glacial R&B and big-drop dancefloor digitals, borrowing, magpie-like, from glam rock and 80s funk. If Mixed Signals â€“ all 80s soft rock via 00s synths â€“ sounds like the Killers, thatâ€™s because Williams hired them to write it. Strangely enough, he wears this windswept stuff surprisingly well. His old pal Rufus Wainwright helps out on Hotel Crazy, a lyrics-heavy vamp that sounds like it should have a West End musical written around it. Millennial-targeting chart fodder isnâ€™t Williamsâ€™s prime concern, anyway. Pretty Woman â€“ a roots gone pop collaboration with Ed Sheeran and producer Benny Blanco â€“ and Sensitive â€“ a forgettable Stuart Price funk-pop bagatelle â€“ are the closest Williams comes to courting the pop crowd. More to the point, the first single from Heavy Entertainment, the oligarch-mocking Party Like a Russian, generated far more commentary than roubles, failing to chart particularly high (No 23). By contrast, 2012â€™s Candy, Williamsâ€™s last reintroductory salvo, topped the singles. Whatever you think of Party Like a Russian â€“ allegedly, it was dreamed up in the aftermath of a Roman Abramovich-funded private gig â€“ few other artists would attempt such camp, bombastic ridiculousness, and todayâ€™s charts are, perhaps, all the more anodyne for that absence of chutzpah. You couldnâ€™t imagine too many celebs singing a song called Motherfucker, either, in which the mental ill health of the forebears is visited upon a young son in tabloid-baiting form. â€œYour uncle sells drugs,â€\\x9d it goes, â€œYour cousin is a cutter/Your grandma is a fluffer/ Your grandadâ€™s in the gutterâ€¦â€\\x9d In its gleeful refusal to provide reassurance to young Charlton Williams, aged two, it is, perhaps, one of the least nausea-inducing songs ever dedicated to a celebrity offspring. The tunes that could only come from Williams make this record entertaining if a little groan-worthy. The could-be-anybody songs just donâ€™t stick in the memory. The albumâ€™s introductory title track is, of course, pure Robbie â€“ another operatic, circussy blare full of his particular brand of self-deprecating preening. â€œI am notorious for making all the crowd sing the chor-i-us,â€\\x9d he smirks. â€œI just made up that word!â€\\x9d If ever something was needed to reconfirm his pop star status, here it is: you still want to biff him.',\n",
              "  \"Paul Ryan and Donald Trump might say they're unified. But there's a bloody civil war on When Donald Trump met with Paul Ryan in Washington on Thursday, you could say it was a meeting between the current and possibly future nominee of the Republican party. Or you could say it was a battle for the soul of the party, between a conservative reformer and nativist rabble-rouser. The latter is how Ryan himself portrayed the debate when he torpedoed the orange flagship on CNN last week. Saying he â€œjust wasnâ€™t readyâ€\\x9d to support Trump, the House speaker warned that Trumpâ€™s platform was not inclusive, presidential or, well, conservative. â€œWe donâ€™t always nominate a Lincoln or a Reagan every four years, but we hope that our nominee aspires to be Lincoln- or Reagan-esque, that that person advances the principles of our party and appeals to a wide, vast majority of Americans,â€\\x9d Ryan said. Ryan insisted that the burden of unifying the party rested with Trump. â€œSaying weâ€™re unified doesnâ€™t in and of itself unify us,â€\\x9d he explained, â€œbut actually taking the principles that we all believe in, showing that thereâ€™s a dedication to those, and running a principled campaign that Republicans can be proud about and that can actually appeal to a majority of Americans â€“ that to me is what it takes to unify this party.â€\\x9d Trump responded in that most presidential of ways: by making it personal. â€œIâ€™m not ready to support Speaker Ryanâ€™s agenda,â€\\x9d he said in a statement. At least the slap wasnâ€™t on Twitter. So when the two great leaders met on Thursday morning, somewhere behind a monster scrum of live-tweeting reporters, the language was a diplomatic veneer of unity. In their joint communique, Trump and Ryan said: â€œWhile we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground.â€\\x9d The joint statement did not detail what that common ground looks like, other than defeating Hillary Clinton. Which sounds much like the statements of a Miss Universe contestant at one of Trumpâ€™s beauty pageants: both contestants agree that they want to travel, help children and work for world peace. Ryan later told reporters a little more about those â€œfew differencesâ€\\x9d, which sounded rather fundamental. â€œHow do we keep adding and adding and adding voters while not subtracting any voters,â€\\x9d he said. He didnâ€™t have to say: like Latinos or women, for instance. Ryanâ€™s challenge is particularly exquisite. He needs unity because his day job is otherwise impossible. It was only six months ago that power was thrust upon him when his own House Republicans devoured both his predecessor, John Boehner, and the anointed successor, Kevin McCarthy. Boehner was sick of the civil war, while his chosen successor was consumed by it. McCarthy committed the unforgivable sin of being honest on TV when he admitted that the Benghazi committee supposedly investigating the deadly attacks in Libya in 2012 was really intended to destroy Clintonâ€™s poll numbers. McCarthy was crushed by the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, who made Boehnerâ€™s position a living hell. That caucus is now almost uniformly opposed to Trump (while McCarthy now loves Trump). There are some early efforts to engineer a meeting between the caucus and the nominee, in an attempt to redefine how an unstoppable force can meet immovable object. Given a choice between placating the Freedom Caucus and placating Donald Trump, Ryan is wisely choosing self-preservation with the former. â€œTo pretend weâ€™re unified without actually unifying, then we go into the fall at half strength,â€\\x9d Ryan told reporters after meeting with House GOP members on Wednesday. Some things are easier when your name is Trump: securing bank loans, declaring bankruptcy, amassing Twitter followers and getting booked for exclusive TV interviews. Some things are harder: mastering policy, acting presidential, leading a party whose power-brokers loathe you. What does peace in the Republican look like? Why, Paul Ryan of course. â€œIâ€™d love to see him run for president,â€\\x9d Mitt Romney reportedly told a private fundraiser meeting last week, according to the New York Times. The last Republican nominee added his name to a long list of pro-Ryan grandees, including Boehner himself, as well as Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. Itâ€™s one thing to shake hands across a party after primary season; itâ€™s entirely different negotiating an armistice between rival armies in the midst of bloody civil war. Especially when the armies believe they have everything left to fight for.\",\n",
              "  \"Austria's Christian Kern calls for EU shakeup regardless of UK vote The British referendum on membership of the EU could herald the â€œslow goodbye of the European ideaâ€\\x9d unless politicians learn their lessons from it, Austriaâ€™s new chancellor has said. â€œWhatever the outcome of the British referendum, afterwards Europe will not be able to shy away from a few much-needed debates,â€\\x9d Christian Kern said in his first interview with the international press since being parachuted to the top of Austrian politics a month ago. Speaking to the , Polandâ€™s Gazeta Wyborcza, Franceâ€™s Le Monde and Germanyâ€™s SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, Kern said that a British exit from the EU would lead to â€œenormous economic upheaval and a shift in the continentâ€™s political balanceâ€\\x9d. He added: â€œEspecially when it comes to foreign policy, Great Britain is an extremely important partner.â€\\x9d But the Social Democrat claimed he would watch Thursdayâ€™s referendum â€œwith a certain serenityâ€\\x9d because he believed fundamental reforms were necessary whatever the outcome. â€œWe have to clear up some fundamental issues in Europe irrespective of whether Brexit or remain will win,â€\\x9d he said. â€œEven without Britain, neoliberal ideas dominate in Europe and one of the challenges for the EU will have to be not just to engage with the four fundamental freedoms [free movement of goods, capital, people and services], but also the question of how our welfare system in Europe has to be clarified. If we ignore that, then thatâ€™s a slow goodbye to the European idea.â€\\x9d Speaking before Marine Le Pen, of Franceâ€™s far-right Front National, called on all 28 member states to hold their own referendums, Kern said he would not hold a vote on EU membership: â€œAt the end of the day, we who lead this country also have a certain responsibility and you donâ€™t have to give in to every call for a referendum. On such a question, I would not submit Austria to a referendum.â€\\x9d The 50-year-old Kern, formerly the head of Austriaâ€™s railway company Ã–BB, has taken on the chancellorship of his country at a tumultuous time. His predecessor, Werner Faymann, in power since 2008, resigned after he said he had lost the trust of his party in the face of a far-right surge for the Freedom party (FPÃ–). Last month, Austria nearly voted in the EUâ€™s first rightwing populist president, after the FPÃ– candidate, Norbert Hofer, narrowly lost to Green-backed Alexander Van der Bellen in a bitterly fought contest. The Freedom party is currently trying to appeal against the result in front of Austriaâ€™s constitutional court. â€œIf you look at the confrontation between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, or the Trump phenomenon, then you see: populists thrive on being able to send out a clear message. They tell people where and how decisions are made. Our problem in Europe is that we have a lot of questions that can no longer be answered on a national stage. â€œIn Europe, an impression is being created that politics has lost the means to intervene into peopleâ€™s living conditions. We have to find a clearer message.â€\\x9d Kern said leftwing parties around Europe needed to reconsider their strategy in dealing with populist parties, with criticism focused on their track record once they had come into power. â€œIn Carinthia, the FPÃ– pushed the region to the edge of bankruptcy and left behind a complete mess. We have to call them out on this much more,â€\\x9d he said. Reacting to the murder of the British Labour MP Jo Cox, Kern said the incident was â€œfurther proof of how quickly violent words can turn into violent deedsâ€\\x9d. He added: â€œOn social media, you see people falling into parallel worlds that we can no longer get them back out of. How do you get back these people who believe that all media and all journalists are lying to them?â€\\x9d In recent months, Austria has witnessed not only a surge in support for the FPÃ– , but also increased high-profile stunts and protests by the so-called Identitarian movement, a far-right activist group originally derived from Franceâ€™s far-right and anti-immigrant youth movement GÃ©nÃ©ration Identitaire, which consciously copies the methods of protest groups such as Antifa and Greenpeace. Last weekend, up to 1,000 Identitarian supporters gathered for a protest in Vienna, chanting: â€œHomeland, freedom, tradition, end of the line for multiculturalism.â€\\x9d While the group has often been dismissed as media-savvy but politically ineffective, Kern said recent events should prompt a rethink about the groupâ€™s legality. The Identitarian movement, he said, was â€œa movement that is generally considered to be rightwing extremist; if you saw what they did in Vienna last week, it reminds you of the marches in the 1930s, with flags and all the trimmings. We have to think about whether we are too tolerant.â€\\x9d Asked whether the group should be banned, Kern said: â€œUntil last week, I would have denied that but, in the meantime, I have started to have my doubts. Three weeks ago, I also said that we have managed to accept 90,000 refugees without seeing any arson attacks on asylum seekersâ€™ homes. In the meantime, weâ€™ve had an instance like that. Things can change quickly.â€\\x9d Kernâ€™s predecessor went from being one of the key supporters of Angela Merkelâ€™s open-border strategy at the height of the refugee crisis to one of its most active critics, and the Austrian foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, was one of the key players behind the closure of the Balkan route in March. Asked if he felt the German chancellor had made a mistake when she suspended the Dublin agreement for Syrian refugees last summer, Kern said: â€œWe were all surprised by the scale of migration movements. You can only judge such decisions in the context of the time. â€œBack then, Angela Merkelâ€™s actions were justified. If you look now at what lengths the German chancellor is going to with Turkey, then it is clear that she wants a change of direction. I donâ€™t want to imagine what happens when the Turkey deal fails.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Barclays needs some big ideas while share price languishes â€˜Our stock price is broadly where it was immediately after the global financial crisis, six years ago,â€\\x9d said Barclays chairman John McFarlane last July, sympathising with the bankâ€™s â€œincredibly patientâ€\\x9d investors and vowing to â€œaccelerate the delivery of shareholder valueâ€\\x9d. His observation about the share price is now out of date. Barclays has plunged from 280p to 173p â€“ back to where it was in the dark days of 2012 when Bob Diamond was forced to resign as chief executive. Most banks have slumped in value since last summer, it should be said. Financial stocks, especially those with investment banks, like Barclays, donâ€™t like falling stock markets. The plunging oil price has brought worries about bad debts in the offing. Regulators are not going soft on their capital demands. In Barclaysâ€™ case, thereâ€™s a deeper worry. Whatâ€™s the strategy? Does Jes Staley, McFarlaneâ€™s pick as the latest chief executive, have a radical reinvention plan? Or is he going to offer another uninspiring round of cost-cutting? Never let a good crisis go to waste, advised Bernsteinâ€™s analysts, in an open letter to Staley. Their radical formula: get out of Africa, sell the US credit card business, and carve out the investment bank and promise to float it in the US, in effect unwinding Diamondâ€™s purchase of the rump of Lehman Brothers. The latter idea is the big one and would require Staley and McFarlane to swallow hard. But Bernstein is right that housing a US investment bank inside a UK retail bank is â€œan absolute investment nightmareâ€\\x9d in the new regulatory era. If Staley and McFarlane disagree, theyâ€™d better be able to show how the unhappy relationship is meant to work. To many observers, it looks fundamentally dysfunctional.',\n",

After an excellent first half, Villa are now playing like Villa. 78 min Villa are having a good spell, although it would be stretching it to say they look like scoring. The youngster Green has been good since coming on. Meanwhile, Swansea bring on Kyle Naughton for the impressive Modou Barrow. 77 min â€œWith tonightâ€™s match as further proof, Iâ€™d submit that this Villa team is the worst in the history of the Premier League,â€\\x9d says Alan Gomes. â€œNot just the worst Villa team, which it obviously is. The very worst team in two decades of Premier League history. Even worse than that post bankrupcy Pompey affair. Tim Sherwood, take a bow!â€\\x9d Never forget. 75 min Villaâ€™s fans appeal for handball when Cissokhoâ€™s cross hits a Swansea defender. 74 min A Villa substitution: Gabby Agbonlahor replaces Carles Gil. 72 min Green runs at Rangel and wins a corner for Villa. Fernandez heads it behind for a second corner, which Gil swings onto the head of Lescott. He sees it late and heads straight at Fabianski from 10 yards. Thatâ€™s the third shot on target in this match. 68 min Sigurdsson, already booked, brings Hutton down. It wasnâ€™t enough for a second yellow. I bet Mike Dean was tempted, though. 67 min â€œShame you have to watch this filth,â€\\x9d weeps Paul Jaines. â€œTo show my solidarity I am sitting in in front of an open fire sipping a beautiful aged Bordeaux and eating French cheese. I may open a Burgundy next.â€\\x9d Iâ€™ll be opening some claret with a sharp pencil in a minute. 66 min A corner to Villa, conceded by Williams. Gil swings it in from the right, and the inevitable Williams heads it clear. He is a brilliant defender. 65 min â€œIâ€™ve watched Villa all season and thatâ€™s got to be the worst goal conceded by any team,â€\\x9d says Thomas Darnton. â€œGuzan should have easily got there. He has made too many mistakes this season and I think that Remi Garde should give Mark Bunn another go because we then wonâ€™t concede shabby goals like that.â€\\x9d Cutting out those cheap goals could be the difference between finishing 20th and, er, eh. 62 min Fer nutmegs Lescott in the box but then picks the wrong option. Swansea are in control now. 62 min A Villa substitution: the 17-year-old Andre Green replaces Veretout. 61 min â€œTo be honest itâ€™s difficult ... â€\\x9d begins Malcolm Tucker Mark Turner. â€œ...to muster a comment and help you out in your onerous task. After a week of wonderful Cheltenham (just watched Sprinter Sacre on YouTube again...spine-tingling), then the amazing Leicester bagging another three points in a tight nail-biter weâ€™re served as dessert...Swansea versus Aston Villa and the home team take the obvious lead after a first half of utter drudge. Sports reporting for the brave, we salute you Mister Rob.â€\\x9d 60 min Sigurdsson is booked for a bad tackle on a Villa player whose name must be withheld for legal reasons I didnâ€™t catch. 58 min Remi Garde slumps back in his chair with the rueul look of a man who bought a collectorâ€™s edition DVD of 8 1/2 on eBay and has just opened the parcel to find a cassette tape of 9 1/2 Weeks. 57 min â€œNot watching it either,â€\\x9d says Michael Rosefield. â€œI find Villa games are best enjoyed with eyes closed, head in hands, rocking yourself back-and-forth and telling yourself everythingâ€™s fine.â€\\x9d That email came before the goal. This one came after. â€œEVERYTHINGâ€™S FINE, EVERYTHINGâ€™S FINE, EVERYTHINGâ€™S FINE.â€\\x9d What a scruffy goal. That foul by Cissokho led to a free-kick for Swansea 40 yards out. It was curled into the corridor of uncertainty by Sigurdsson, which tempted Guzan off his line. He got there late and flapped it onto Fernandez, who was looking the other way when the ball hit him and rebounded gently into the net. 52 min Cissokho, on a yellow card, trips the dangerous Barrow. It looks like a second yellow card, but Mike Dean instead decides to give Cissokho a final warning. I want to marry Mike Dean. 51 min â€œHow do you see the relegation battle going, especially Benitez is in charge of Newcastle?â€\\x9d says Shaun Wilkinson. â€œWill he make the difference? I would suggest that whoever loses the derby tomorrow is going down with the Villa.â€\\x9d Relegation battles are relatively hard to predict. There have been some thoroughly improbable escapes in the last decade â€“ West Ham, Fulham, Wigan, Portsmouth â€“ so I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if any of them apart from Villa stayed up. And thatâ€™s the expertise for which you all love the . (I think Newcastle and Norwich will go.) 50 min â€œI am here, I have money on Siggy,â€\\x9d says Paul E. â€œNot even watching, just reading you.â€\\x9d Iâ€™m sorry. 48 min Barrow makes another no-frills run infield, opening up the play. Then he shifts it to Sigurdsson, who breaks towards the area before Lescott makes an important interception. 47 min Anyone out there? Please, please, please donâ€™t make me do another 45 minutes of this on my own. 46 min Swansea begin the second half. They have brought ball-retention specialist Leon Britton on for Ki. The match has lived down to expectations so far. Villa should be ahead, but they arenâ€™t. See you in 10 minutes! 42 min A terrific cross from Gueye is half cleared to Gestede, who loops an overhead kick towards goal from 12 yards. Fabianski had it covered but Williams headed it away for a corner to be on the safe side. From the corner, Clark heads over from 10 yards, a decent chance. 40 min Williams makes an excellent sliding challenge on the right of the area to deny Ayew, and the ball deflects back off Ayew for a goalkick. Why did none of the big clubs buy Williams when he was in his prime? 38 min Barrow runs at Cissokho but then plays a poor pass to Ki on the edge of the box. He is a threat with his speed though. Gomis then screams a long-range shot high and wide. 35 min Rangel gets into the box on the right and picks out Sigurdsson, whose first-time shot is blocked by Clark. 33 min Veretoutâ€™s flat cross is met with a powerful flicked header from Gestede, 15 yards out. Fabianski plunges to his left to make a comfortable save. 32 min Sigurdsson plays a fine through ball to Barrow, who is just offside. Not that it mattered, because he over-ran the ball when he went round Guzan. He has been Swanseaâ€™s biggest threat though. He is comically fast. 31 min With every passing minute of Villa superiority, it becomes ever more obvious that Swansea will win 1-0 with a 94th-minute own goal from Alan Hutton. 29 min Sigurdsson curls the free kick high and wide. 27 min Gomis finds Barrow, who zooms forward before being hoofed up in the air by Cissokho. Thatâ€™s a clear yellow card and a free-kick to Swansea 30 yards from goal. 24 min Sigurdssonâ€™s dangerous inswinging free-kick from the left is headed behind for a corner by Lescott with Guzan flailing at fresh air. 21 min Villa get a corner on the right. Veretout swings it out to the near post, where Clark rises and flicks a header just over the bar from six yards. He should probably have scored. 20 min A long throw from Hutton almost breaks to Ayew in the six-yard box, and eventually itâ€™s scrambled clear. 19 min Kingsleyâ€™s mishit clearance hits the raised hand of Williams, but he knew precisely nothing about it and a penalty would have been harsh. I bet Mike Dean was tempted though. 18 min Gueyeâ€™s fierce low shot from 25 yards is blocked. Villa have been by far the better team. 16 min Gestede and Williams square up after an impromptu wrestle, and then a few of the other players join in. Mike Dean doesnâ€™t book either player. Williams shoved Gestede in the face, which might warrant a retrospective ban the way things are these days. 13 min Barrowâ€™s driven cross is put behind for a corner by Clark at the near post. Sigurdsson takes the corner from the right, and the stooping Cork heads wide of the near post. It wasnâ€™t any kind of chance. 8 min Ayew misses a good chance for Villa. Cork lost the ball in a dangerous position, allowing Ayew to run towards goal. He slipped smoothly past Williams on the edge of the box but then walloped his shot over the bar. 7 min â€œThere was this as well when Villa were challenging for the title,â€\\x9d says Niall Mullen. â€œUnited were on the cusp of greatness. 23 years ago. Twenty three.â€\\x9d 6 min Villa have started confidently and are playing some good stuff. 3 min Fer dithers and unwittingly gives the ball to Lescott, who drills a snapshot wide from the edge of the area. 2 min â€œYour preamble made me wonder: would Villa somehow staying up rival Leicester winning the league for story of the season?â€\\x9d says Alex Hanton. â€œOr are there no events in English football that could rival it? Maybe if Flamini invents time travel and Arsenal replace Gunnersaurus with an actual cloned velociraptor?â€\\x9d Iâ€™m not even sure Leicester winning the league can live up to the thought of Leicester winning the league. Itâ€™s the greatest football story of our generation, at the very least. 1 min Peep peep! Weâ€™re off. Some happier memories for Villa fans â€œYou beauuuuuty!â€\\x9d And this, an epic League Cup semi-final. Swansea (4-3-3) Fabianski, Rangel, Williams, Fernandez, Kingsley; Fer, Cork, Ki; Barrow, Gomis, Sigurdsson. Subs: Amat, Britton, Paloschi, Nordfeldt, Routledge, Montero, Naughton. Aston Villa (4-2-3-1) Guzan; Hutton, Clark, Lescott, Cissokho; Westwood, Gana; Gil, Veretout, Ayew; Gestede. Subs: Okore, Bacuna, Sinclair, Agbonlahor, Sanchez, Green, Bunn. Referee Mike Dean (Wirral) Hello. Forgive me for speaking frankly, but the love child of Don King and Barry Hearn would struggle to hype this match. Itâ€™s not without significance, however. Villa are down, barring the Mother Teresa of great escapes, but Swansea arenâ€™t quite safe. They have a tough run-in after today, and if results go against them they could be a precarious five points clear of safety by tomorrow. Then again, if they win at home to Villa â€“ and, really, they will need to take a very long look in a very long mirror if they donâ€™t â€“ they will surely be immune from relegation. Kick off is at 5.30pm.',\n",
              "  'Ebola survivors face long-term neurological problems, researchers find Ebola survivors are continuing to suffer from neurological problems more than six months after infection, according to the early results of a new study. The findings from research undertaken by US neurologists in Liberia appear to confirm suspicions that there are serious long-term effects of Ebola virus disease. They have been made public days after Pauline Cafferkey, the nurse who contracted Ebola while working as a volunteer in Sierra Leone, was admitted for the third time to the infectious diseases unit of the Royal Free hospital. The study was carried out in Liberia by researchers from the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda. A team of neurologists travelled to Liberia, where they recruited 87 survivors of the epidemic for a study on the long-term impact on the brain. Four were excluded because of other conditions. The remaining 82 were examined by the team and compared with close contacts who had not contracted the Ebola virus. Most of the survivors had health issues and neurological damage of some kind. â€œWhile an end to the outbreak has been declared, these survivors are still struggling with long-term problems,â€\\x9d said Lauren Bowen, the studyâ€™s author. The survivors had an average age of 35. The most common ongoing problems they experienced were weakness, headache, memory loss, depressed mood and muscle pain. Two people were suicidal and one had hallucinations. Common neurological findings on examination included abnormal eye movements, tremors and abnormal reflexes. Their friends and relatives are also being examined to try to determine which of these findings are specifically related to Ebola virus infection. â€œIt is important for us to know how this virus may continue to affect the brain long term,â€\\x9d said Bowen. Her neurological study is part of a larger piece of research called Prevail III, which monitors Ebola survivors. â€œMore than 28,600 people were infected with Ebola in west Africa during the outbreak. Of that number, 11,300 died. In collaboration with the ongoing Prevail III natural history study of Ebola survivors, we wanted to find out more about possible continued long-term brain health problems for the more than 17,000 survivors of the infection.â€\\x9d The full study will be presented to the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in Vancouver in April. Cafferkey, 40, who returned from working in the Kerry Town Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone, run by Save the Children, in December 2014, spent almost a month in isolation in the Royal Free in January 2015. When she was discharged and returned to her home in Scotland, it was assumed that her problems were over, but last October she again fell ill. She was diagnosed with meningitis, triggered by the Ebola virus lingering in her nervous system. Again she was transferred to the Royal Free, where she came close to death but rallied and returned home. She has now been admitted again â€œdue to a late complication from her previous infection by the Ebola virusâ€\\x9d, a Royal Free spokesperson said. Her condition is said to be stable.',\n",
              "  'Why Big Ang from Mob Wives was the most gif-worthy reality star ever To a lot of people, reality television is simply mindless, lowbrow entertainment. For me, itâ€™s a lot more than that. Reality television and pop culture have been passions of mine for years â€“ as a hobby and a job. Unfortunately reality television can sometimes become too real. My name is T Kyle. Who? you might ask. You may have seen my work on the internet before. Just under five years ago, I started a Tumblr called RealityTVGIFs. To most of my audience, the Tumblr is a destination site for reaction gifs. However, my close friends know that RealityTVGIFs is my digital diary. I capture my reactions, opinions and responses to things going on in pop culture and in my personal life. It is a diary expressed via outrageous reality show moments. Weird? Maybe. But amid my daily stresses, it makes me laugh. Mob Wives is a VH1 show that follows Staten Island women connected to men with alleged mob ties. Whether or not you watch it, if you visit my site you know who Big Ang was. The showâ€™s star died of cancer on Thursday aged 55. I was an employee at Viacom when Mob Wives was renewed after its incredibly successful debut season. We would have these town hall events where the bigwigs at the company would present teaser trailers for new, upcoming programming. The second season of Mob Wives was about to premiere, and they played a short cast profile of a new cast member. Her name was Angela â€œBig Angâ€\\x9d Raiola. â€œLast night me and my friend were out partying with the guys like we were 21 â€¦â€\\x9d I immediately turned to a co-worker and said, â€œShe is going to be a huge breakout star.â€\\x9d I just knew it. The hoarse voice, the outsized lips, that big laugh. Big Ang rapidly became, as I predicted, an internet sensation. Whether it was rolling her eyes, hollering that she needed a drink or simply announcing, â€œI donâ€™t give a shit,â€\\x9d in the middle of a scene, Big Angâ€™s reactions were always hilarious, unexpected and real. This is why she was so â€œgif-ableâ€\\x9d and made such great television. Every single thing she did was over-the-top. In a recent episode, the girls gather for a yoga session. The instructor asks the girls to â€œOmâ€\\x9d. Completely over it, Big Ang starts whining in that unique raspy voice â€œOmmmm I need a bloody maryyy.â€\\x9d I exploded in laughter, and Iâ€™ve been quoting the scene to friends ever since it aired. As someone who works in entertainment, the fourth wall gets broken a lot. Youâ€™ll find yourself at an event lending an iPhone charger to a Mob Wife, trying to explain what gif means to a Drag Race contestant, or even doing lemon-drop shots with a Real Housewife. Iâ€™ve met many reality stars over the years and sometimes they suffer from inflated egos, boosted by their 15 minutes of fame. Big Ang was not one of those reality stars. Contrary to the ruthless one-liners and occasional violence you see on Mob Wives each week, the entire cast is actually a very kind and gracious bunch. Big Ang was one of the kindest and most humble people Iâ€™ve ever met. Big Ang and her relatives, her cast mates, her friends; they all made you feel like you were family when you were around them. Her energy, her laugh and her smile were infectious. Every person I know, from her adoring fans to network professionals, have had nothing but positive things to say about her. She was genuinely so kind to every person she worked with. We were her â€œbabiesâ€\\x9d. On the show, you would often see Big Ang playing the peacemaker and trying to resolve issues among cast members. â€œWeâ€™re only here for a short time, so just have a good time!â€\\x9d This was not a â€œcharacterâ€\\x9d she was playing, it is how she truly was. That was her reality, and we loved her for it. I post about Big Ang a lot on RealityTVGIFs. â€œYouâ€™re obsessed with her!â€\\x9d fans would say. Yes, I am. As a fan she made me smile and as a professional, I wanted everything she did to be successful. She was a great person and she deserved all the success, the â€œmoney!â€\\x9d and â€œdiamonds!â€\\x9d, to quote two of her favourite words. It is people like Big Ang who made me enjoy my job, and she will truly be missed.',\n",
              "  \"Brexit would free UK from 'spirit-crushing' green directives, says minister The UK could develop a more flexible approach to environmental protection free of â€œspirit-crushingâ€\\x9d Brussels directives if it votes to leave the EU, the farming minister, George Eustice, has said. Speaking to the , the pro-Brexit minister said a leave vote in the 23 June referendum would free up a Â£2bn green dividend that could be spent on insurance schemes and incentives for farmers. Environmental laws that have helped protect endangered species and clean up dirty beaches are seen one of the key achievements of the EU, but Eustice sought to reassure green-minded voters that the UK could develop better protections by going it alone. â€œThe birds and habitats directives would go,â€\\x9d he said, referring to two key pieces of European environmental law. â€œA lot of the national directives they instructed us to put in place would stay. But the directivesâ€™ framework is so rigid that it is spirit-crushing. â€œIf we had more flexibility, we could focus our scientistsâ€™ energies on coming up with new, interesting ways to protect the environment, rather than just producing voluminous documents from Brussels.â€\\x9d The leave camp says that, in the event of a Brexit vote, Â£2bn would be earmarked for conservation spending out of the money it expects to recoup from payments to Brussels. â€œOur objective would be to put in place a government-backed insurance scheme, similar to the one in Canada, to protect farmers from bad weather, crop failures and drops in prices,â€\\x9d Eustice said. â€œWe would also have a whole suite of accreditation schemes run by the Soil Association, Rivers Trust and RSPCA to incentivise farmers to do positive things for the environment.â€\\x9d But Eusticeâ€™s fellow environment minister Rory Stewart told the that EU membership was crucial to the UKâ€™s environmental protections. â€œIt is European action that put a stop to the devastating impact on our forests of acid rain, and we are now tackling air quality by cutting harmful emissions. Through the EU we have improved more than 9,000 miles of rivers since 2010 and our water environment is in the healthiest state for 25 years,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe have preserved valuable marine life through ending the wasteful practice of throwing fish back, dead, into the sea with a Europe-wide ban on discarding many species of fish. From tackling harmful chemicals that damage the ozone layer to cracking down on the black-market ivory trade, the UK has a strong track record in driving up environmental standards across Europe.â€\\x9d Environmentalists said they feared a developmental free-for-all on sites shielded by the EUâ€™s Natura 2000 scheme, including Snowdonia, the Lake District, the Thames estuary, the North Yorkshire Moors, Scotlandâ€™s Flow Country and Dartmoor. One of the original authors of EU environmental legislation was Stanley Johnson, Borisâ€™s father, who now co-chairs Environmentalists for Europe. He said of Eusticeâ€™s proposal: â€œI am absolutely shocked and horrified at what looks like a no-holds-barred attack by the Brexiteers on an agreed consensus that the environment benefits from a common approach. â€œDonâ€™t tell me that a new Brexit-led British government is going to put environmental regulations at top of its pile on June 24. It is not going to happen.â€\\x9d The European commission is reviewing the birds and habitats directives â€“ which define Europeâ€™s conservation strategy â€“ and is under unprecedented public pressure not to water them down. The origin of the â€œfitness checkâ€\\x9d lies in a domestic review instigated by George Osborne in 2011, when he told parliament that the â€œgold-platingâ€\\x9d of EU habitat rules was imposing â€œridiculous costsâ€\\x9d on business. Martin Harper, the conservation director of the RSPB, said: â€œThese nature directives have been the cornerstone of nature conservation in Europe since coming into force. Not only have they improved the fortunes of threatened species but they are essential if we want to meet our international biodiversity commitments.â€\\x9d On pesticides, Eustice said the EUâ€™s precautionary principle needed to be reformed in favour of a US-style risk-based approach, allowing faster authorisation. â€œA precautionary approach is the right thing to do but it should be based on realistic assessments of risk and not just theoretical hazards,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThat is the wrong way to go about it.â€\\x9d The principle has underpinned bans on GM foods, neonicotonoid inseciticides linked to bee colony declines and endocrine disrupting chemicals. The marine strategy directive would also be scrapped, Eustice said. He cited a dispute with Brussels over the UKâ€™s failure to designate protected marine areas for harbour porpoises as an example of over-regulation, when dolphin-repelling electronic devices could have been used on nets instead. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society said electronic pingers could already be used under current EU nature laws, which also protect porpoises from trawling, dredging, pile driving and noise from military sonars. Clive Lewis, the shadow energy and climate change spokesperson, said: â€œIt is absurd to suggest that Brexit could be good for the environment when the major challenges we face, not least the risk of catastrophic climate change, are international by their nature.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'Everton 3-1 Middlesbrough: Premier League â€“ as it happened Everton go back to second in the table, having taken 13 points from their first five games. Itâ€™s their best start since 1978-79. They respond impressively to Maarten Stekelenburgâ€™s own goal and were comfortable winners, with Gareth Barry scoring on his 600th Premier League appearance. Thanks for your company; night. 90+1 min A nice touch from Ronald Koeman, who substitutes Gareth Barry so that he can get an ovation from the crowd. Tom Cleverley replaces him. 90 min There will be two minutes of added formality. 88 min Everton play a bit of keep-ball to amuse themselves. They look a good side, and so much more solid than last season. 86 min â€œI want 3000 words by Monday on Everton and Liverpool being top dogs in the league once more, just like back in the day before wireless meant anything other than a radio,â€\\x9d writes my owner Ian Copestake. 84 min Middlesbrough make their final substitution, with Adam Clayton replacing Forshaw. 82 min Fischerâ€™s fierce shot from 20 yards is blocked by the stretching Coleman. I think it would have otherwise inconvenienced Stekelenburg. 80 min De Roonâ€™s high cross is punched away under pressure by Stekelenburg, and Downingâ€™s follow-up shot hits a defender. 79 min Idrissa Gueye has had another excellent game for Everton. 77 min Bolasie mavericks past Barragan but then runs into a second defender. 76 min Boro donâ€™t look like getting a corner, never mind scoring. I think theyâ€™ll stay up, but if they do it wonâ€™t be because of their attack. 74 min â€œAgree 100% with the mooted Incorrigible Mavericks rule,â€\\x9d says David Hopkins. â€œAll the better if their skills have little practical application. Iâ€™m thinking of Ted McMinn dribbling past some hapless fullback, stopping, then doing it once more for a laugh.â€\\x9d 72 min Gerard Deulofeu replaces Kevin Mirallas for Everton. 70 min Both sides have accepted the result, and the match is drifting along increasingly aimlessly. 69 min Another Boro substitution: Viktor Fischer, the former boy wonder, replaces Gaston Ramirez. 66 min Enner Valencia comes on for his Everton debut, replacing the injured Lukaku. It looks like a precautionary substitution rather than anything more serious, although Lukaku has gone straight down the tunnel. 63 min Barkley almost frees Lukaku in the box; eventually the ball pinballs through the keeper Valdes. When Barkley plays like this, with such penetrative simplicity, you can see why so many managers get excited about him. 62 min â€œIâ€™m not actually watching the game, but glad to see Bolasie involved,â€\\x9d says Matt Dony. â€œHe is possibly the most entertaining player in world football. I mean, heâ€™s obviously not in that â€˜top, top playerâ€™ bracket, but the sheer unpredictability is worth the entrance fee. In that respect, he reminds me of Luis Garcia in his 2006/7 pomp. The best player in history for 10 minutes of any given match, an absolute liability for the other 80.â€\\x9d Quite. There should be a quota system whereby every team has to include one incorrigible maverick in their XI. If we can clone Adel Taarabt, so much the better. 59 min Middlesbrough bring on David Nugent for Emilio Nsue. 56 min Everton are in total control of the game now, and Barkley draws a good save from Valdes with a stinging low drive. Barkley has been excellent today, possibly the best player on the pitch. 54 min Mirallasâ€™s golden five minutes continues with a dreadful piece of control in the box after fine play from Barkley. 51 min Baines makes a virtue of a dismal pass from Mirallas, winning a corner as a result. Itâ€™s headed away by Friend. 50 min Middlesbrough, tactically speaking, werenâ€™t really built with 3-1 deficits in mind. They are a neat, tidy side but they donâ€™t create that many chances. This should be a comfortable second half for Everton. 49 min It looks like the third goal has been given to Lukaku. Iâ€™m not sure he touched it, mind. 46 min Peep peep! Everton begin the second half, and as things stand this will be their best start to a season since 1978-79. Half-time reading aka â€˜I think it was me who said...â€™ After a slow start, that was an enjoyable half of football. The worst thing Middlesbrough did was take the lead, because it woke Everton and the crowd up. See you soon for the second half. 45+2 min Gareth Barry is booked for a foul on Ramirez. Bolasieâ€™s inswinging cross from the right drifts past everyone and into the net. Lukaku claimed it but I donâ€™t think he got a touch. Valdes appealed that Lukaku was offside but replays showed he was fine. Seamus Coleman gives Everton the lead with a fine solo goal. He received Gueyeâ€™s pass just outside the area on the right, burst past a couple of defenders and finished calmly into the bottom corner with his left foot. 40 min Barrajan loafs forward promisingly, only to get giddy and hoof one miles over the bar from 25 yards. 36 min Barkley beats Ayala with a beautiful flicked nutmeg, a bit like Robbie Fowler on Steve Staunton when he scored that famous goal against Aston Villa in 1996, and then runs into the box before hitting a shot that is well blocked by a combination of Gibson and the recovering Ayala. When the ball went dead Ayala was booked for attempting to pull Barkley back after he had been turned. 34 min â€œYouâ€™re right about the Middlesbrough goal looking like Andy Grayâ€™s goal at Wembley in 1984,â€\\x9d says Gary Naylor. â€œIf weâ€™re playing the same rules as 32 years ago, I look forward to plenty of tackles from behind, a few professional fouls and a shinpad-splitting challenge or two. No cards though. And a title for us next year.â€\\x9d 32 min A fine effort from Bolaise, who thumps a 15-yard header onto the roof of the net from Bainesâ€™s hanging cross. 28 min Barkley ruins an excellent run by blazing over the bar when Lukaku was in a better position. 26 min â€œPretty sure Andy Gray never played in a World Cup final,â€\\x9d says Richie Segal, making a very fair point. What the hell was I thinking there? 25 min Middlesbrough might also be aggrieved with the goal against them, because Williams challenged Valdes with his studs showing. Howard Webb says it was a probably a free-kick, and heâ€™ll be thrilled to know I agree with him. Gareth Barry equalises for Everton. On today of all days. A corner from the left rebounded across the box, and Barry half-volleyed it calmly into the top of the net. Thatâ€™s an excellent finish actually, and a rare goal to mark his 600th Premier League appearance. 23 min The BT commentators - Steve McManaman, Glenn Hoddle and Howard Webb - all think it was a fair goal. Iâ€™m not so sure. Stekelenburg was a bit weak but Iâ€™m not sure Negredo didnâ€™t foul him. Everton are not happy with this, and there are echoes of Andy Grayâ€™s goal in the 1984 World Cup final. Downing hung up a deep cross towards the far post, where Stekelenburg was in the process of catching it when Negredo powered through and headed the ball into the net. Actually, I think itâ€™s an own goal because Negredo seemed to knock Stekelenburgâ€™s arm, which knocked the ball out of his hands and into the net. 20 min Mirallas comes inside from the left and drills a low shot that is comfortably held by Valdes. Everton have stirred after a sluggish start. 19 min A good effort from Barkley, who moves away from Forshaw and hits a wobbling left-footed shot from 25 yards that is beaten away by Valdes. 17 min It would be silly to jump to conclusions after four and a bit games, so thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™m going to do: Boro wonâ€™t go down this season. They look a really good, organised side. 15 min Barry, on his 600th Premier League appearance, is robbed in a dangerous area but Ramirez. He moves straight for goal but Coleman makes a good tackle on the edge of the area. 13 min Everton win their first corner, to be taken by Mirallas on the right. Jagielka mistimes his jump at the near post and shoulders it over the bar. 12 min Hereâ€™s Hubert Oâ€™Hearn. â€œKoemanâ€™s knack of almost instantly shaping a club into an attractive and downright scary side, no matter what players he loses, reminds me of a wonderful line about Jack Nicklaus and his clubs (golf variety): â€˜He can play with his and beat you, or he can take yours and still beat you.â€™â€\\x9d 10 min Thereâ€™s not a huge amount happening right now. 6 min The overlapping Friend is fouled by Coleman on the left wing. Actually, it looks quite a soft free-kick on second glance. Ramirez curls the free-kick towards the near post, where Downing flicks a header across the face of goal and wide. Ayala almost got to it at the far post. 5 min Itâ€™s been a confident start from Boro in what sounds like a very muted atmosphere, though that might just be that somebody has pressed the wrong button in the BT bunker. 1 min Peep peep! Middlesbrough, in red, kick off from left to right. Everton are in blue. â€œReidâ€™s cross - GRAY!â€\\x9d If youâ€™re an Everton fan, with a fondness for the years 1984 and 1985, this book is definitely for you. Itâ€™s published by deCoubertin, who have a cracking collection of Everton books in particular. Everton (4-2-3-1) Stekelenburg; Coleman, Williams, Jagielka, Baines; Gueye, Barry; Mirallas, Barkley, Bolasie; Lukaku. Substitutes: Joel, Deulofeu, Lennon, Cleverley, Valencia, Funes Mori, Holgate. Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1) Valdes; Barragan, Ayala, Gibson, Friend; De Roon, Forshaw; Nsue, Ramirez, Downing; Negredo. Substitutes: Guzan, Espinosa, Clayton, Fischer, Chambers, Nugent, Traore. Kevin de Bruyne is Pepâ€™s Michael Laudrup, discuss Hello. Sometimes, a playerâ€™s weakness becomes his strength as a manager: think of George Graham and Glenn Hoddle, swaggering midfielders and magnificent defensive coaches, or hard-faced centre-back Tony Mowbray preaching tiki-taka in the Midlands. Ronald Koeman and Aitor Karanka, whose Everton and Middlesbrough sides meet at Goodison Park today, took their playing strengths with them when they went into management: both were defenders (well, nominally in Koemanâ€™s case) and both know exactly what to do with a bank of four. Both teams are not without attacking flair, but defence will be the key to whether their achieve their ambitions this season. Middlesbrough will be happy to stay up; Everton, who are currently the closest of the also-rans to the champions Manchester City, are aiming for Europe. Kick off is at 5.30pm. Rob will be here shortly. In the meantime, why not have a read of Andy Hunter on how Ronald Koeman feels the noise more than MartÃ\\xadnez and Moyes after his strong start at Everton?',\n",
              "  'Conservative party turmoil escalates with open call for Cameron to quit David Cameronâ€™s hopes of being able to avoid terminal damage to Conservative party unity after the EU referendum campaign were dented on Sunday when two rebel MPs openly called for a new leader and a general election before Christmas. The attacks came from Andrew Bridgen and Nadine Dorries â€“ both Brexiters, and longstanding, publicity-hungry opponents of the prime minister â€“ and their claim that even winning the EU referendum wonâ€™t stop Cameron facing a leadership challenge in the summer was dismissed by fellow Tories. But their comments coincided with the ministers in charge of the leave campaign launching some of their strongest personal attacks yet on Cameron, prompting Labourâ€™s Alan Johnson to say that the Tory infighting was getting â€œvery ugly indeedâ€\\x9d. Bridgen told the BBCâ€™s 5 Live that Cameron had been making â€œoutrageousâ€\\x9d claims in his bid to persuade voters to back remain and that, as a consequence, he had effectively lost his parliamentary majority. â€œThe party is fairly fractured, straight down the middle and I donâ€™t know which character could possibly pull it back together going forward for an effective government. I honestly think we probably need to go for a general election before Christmas and get a new mandate from the people,â€\\x9d he said. Bridgen said at least 50 Tory MPs â€“ the number needed to call a confidence vote â€“ felt the same way about Cameron and that a vote on the prime ministerâ€™s future was â€œprobably highly likelyâ€\\x9d after the referendum. Dorries told ITVâ€™s Peston on Sunday she had already submitted her letter to the chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee expressing no confidence in the prime minister. â€œ[Cameron] has lied profoundly, and I think that is actually really at the heart of why Conservative MPs have been so angered. To say that Turkey is not going to join the European Union as far as 30 years is a lie.â€\\x9d A leadership contest would only take place if Cameron lost a confidence vote, which would be unlikely if the remain campaign wins the referendum. But a sizeable vote against Cameron in a confidence ballot could still prove fatal to his premiership, forcing him to accelerate plans for his departure. Dorries said that if remain won 60/40, Cameron would probably survive. â€œIf remain win by a narrow majority, or if leave win, heâ€™s toast within days,â€\\x9d she said. Even if, as many Tories expect, a confidence vote does not materialise, the Bridgen/Dorries comments are a reminder of how maverick, hardline Eurosceptics were able to play havoc with John Majorâ€™s government in the 1990s because he had such a small majority. Cameronâ€™s working majority is just 16. The Conservative MP Steve Baker said Bridgen â€œ[had] a pointâ€\\x9d about how unsympathetic backbenchers were towards Cameronâ€™s EU stance. Baker claimed only about 30 were very strongly committed to remain â€“ and he said he thought there could be â€œa problemâ€\\x9d for the prime minister after 23 June. But more senior figures in Tory Brexit camp backed Cameron and insisted a confidence vote would not happen because the rebels would not get enough support. â€œI donâ€™t think there are 50 colleagues gunning for the prime minister,â€\\x9d said Chris Grayling, the justice secretary. â€œI can assure you that those people who fought to win their seats 12 months ago are definitely not gunning for a general election by Christmas.â€\\x9d Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee, said Bridgenâ€™s intervention was â€œunfortunateâ€\\x9d and that the party had to pull together after the referendum. Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, said the party would need â€œa period of stabilityâ€\\x9d after the referendum and that it would be best for Cameron to stay as prime minister. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, also said he was not in favour of replacing Cameron. In a particularly personal attack that seemed clearly aimed at Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, Priti Patel, the employment minister, used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to say it was â€œshamefulâ€\\x9d that wealthy remain campaigners did not realise how much harm mass immigration was doing to the poor. â€œIf you have private wealth or if you work for Goldman Sachs youâ€™ll be fine. But when public services are under pressure, it is those people who do not have the luxury of being able to afford the alternatives who are most vulnerable,â€\\x9d she wrote. â€œItâ€™s shameful that those leading the pro-EU campaign fail to care for those who do not have their advantages.â€\\x9d Patelâ€™s article coincided with Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, and Michael Gove, the justice secretary, writing an open letter to Cameron asking him to accept that it would be impossible for him to achieve his manifesto promise of getting net migration below 100,000 if the UK stayed in the EU. The letter, also signed by Labourâ€™s Gisela Stuart, said failure to keep this promise â€œis corrosive of public trustâ€\\x9d. A source close to Cameron said that there was now overwhelming evidence, backed up by Sundayâ€™s survey of economists, that leaving the EU would cause a â€œserious economic shockâ€\\x9d and that â€œthe suggestion that crashing your economy is the best way of dealing with immigration is clearly nonsenseâ€\\x9d. Commenting on the Tory turmoil, Alan Johnson, chair of Labour In for Britain, said: â€œWhat is extraordinary is the vindictiveness and nastiness we are seeing within the Conservative party and Conservative cabinet. I think itâ€™s very ugly, very ugly indeed. If those are David Cameronâ€™s friends and allies, heâ€™s welcome to them.â€\\x9d Andrew Bridgen profile Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire since 2010, has form as a critic of David Cameronâ€™s. In 2013 he publicly admitted that he had sent a letter to the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee calling for a vote of confidence in his leader. Explaining his decision in a newspaper article, he said there was a â€œcredibility problemâ€\\x9d with Cameron. â€œThe voters think we have many of the right messages â€“ they just donâ€™t believe the messenger. In some cases, the messages are wrong or badly handled. By pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a promise on an EU referendum until he was forced to do so, Mr Cameron has fuelled the rise of Ukip. We have created our own nemesis,â€\\x9d he wrote. â€œI think the situation is this: itâ€™s like being in an aeroplane. The pilot doesnâ€™t know how to land it. We can either do something about it before the crash, or sit back, watch the in-flight movies and wait for the inevitable.â€\\x9d At the time Bridgen was one of only two Tory MPs known to have written a letter calling for a confidence vote. The other, Patrick Mercer, resigned after a lobbying scandal. A year later Bridgen wrote an open letter to Cameron formally withdrawing his letter calling for a confidence vote, and offering Cameron his â€œfull and enthusiastic supportâ€\\x9d. Explaining his volte-face, he said much had happened in the meantime.',\n",
              "  'New Hampshire results: resounding wins for Trump and Sanders Voters in New Hampshire delivered a resounding rebuke to the US political establishment on Tuesday, with strong wins for leftwing Democrat Bernie Sanders and bombastic Republican outsider Donald Trump in the second major test of the 2016 presidential race. The Vermont senatorâ€™s victory over Hillary Clinton will give him much needed momentum as he heads for tougher states farther south, while high voter turnout helped power Trump to a double-digit victory that could end up matching consistent polling leads he has maintained since declaring his candidacy. Voters hungry for what Sanders calls â€œpolitical revolutionâ€\\x9d turned out in large numbers to vote for the Democratic socialist, according to the Associated Press. Sanders took to the stage at his victory party and wasted no time going straight to the theme that appears to have dominated the election here: campaign finance. â€œTogether we have sent a message that will resonate from Wall Street to Washington ... that government belongs to all of the people,â€\\x9d he said to applause and foot-stomping from a fired up audience of mixed ages. But he warned of the brickbats ahead as the campaign prepares to move to the national stage. â€œThey are throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink, and I have a feeling that it is coming soon,â€\\x9d he said. One of the biggest cheers of the night came when he started a sentence: â€œWhen we make it to the White House ... â€\\x9d but the crowd turned and shook their fists at the press riser when Sanders talked of â€œsending a message to the media establishmentâ€\\x9d. Foreign policy also made a return to his stump speech, after a period of relative absence during campaigning here that had attracted growing criticism. â€œAs president I will defend this nation, but I will do it responsibly,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe cannot and should not be the policeman of the world. â€œThank you, New Hampshire,â€\\x9d he concluded. â€œNow itâ€™s on to Nevada, South Carolina and beyond.â€\\x9d Trump gave an unusually emotional speech to supporters in a hotel ballroom next to a Best Western hotel by the Manchester airport, starting by thanking his deceased parents as well as his siblings. He also took a moment to mention Sanders. â€œCongratulations to Bernie,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe have to congratulate him, we may not like it. He wants to give away our country, folks. Weâ€™re not going to let it happen.â€\\x9d Trumpâ€™s campaign, fueled by a blend of insurgent populism and unprecedented media attention, has turned every rule of politics on its head. His success in New Hampshire happened despite comparatively weak campaign organization in the state and a penchant for controversial remarks that would have sunk the campaigns of almost any other candidate. Yet none of the controversies have affected Trumpâ€™s standing with his base of disaffected blue-collar white voters, who remain drawn to his pledge to â€œMake America Great Againâ€\\x9d. Many of Trumpâ€™s themes were familiar to a New Hampshire primary electorate that strongly supported Pat Buchanan in 1992 and 1996; but Trump added an aura of celebrity and drew in many who were entirely new to the political process. What remained less clear as the polls closed was how the pile-up of candidates vying to finish in the top tier behind Trump would perform. Ohio governor John Kasich came in second place with 15.9% to Trumpâ€™s 35.1%, according to the AP, with almost 89% of precincts reporting. â€œMaybe â€“ just maybe â€“ we are turning the page on a dark part of American politics, because tonight the light overcame the darkness,â€\\x9d Kasich told supporters in Concord. By dawn, the fight over third place was still not formally resolved, though Texas senator Ted Cruz led former Florida governor Jeb Bush by a narrow 11.6% to 11.1% â€“ a margin of 1,240 votes. Florida senator Marco Rubio, who had been tipped as the man to emerge as the establishment favourite, was languishing in a damaging fifth place on 10.6%. He admitted his slump was â€œon meâ€\\x9d after a terrible debate performance days before polling which left him looking scripted and inauthentic. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor whose last act ahead of the primary was to savage Rubio on the debate stage, seemed all but certain to suspend his campaign in the coming days, admitting he would return home to New Jersey to consider his next moves. The fight over the 2016 Democratic nomination had been expected to be a wintertime formality for Clinton. But the prospect of sustained campaigns from Sanders had sent the former secretary of stateâ€™s campaign into a whirlwind of spin about whether the outsider surge could last. The call for Sanders came early: with nearly 60% of precincts reporting, he had 59.3% of the votes to Clintonâ€™s 38.9%. By morning, with 89% of votes counted, that margin held good â€“ Sanders on 60%, Clinton on 38.4%. At the Sanders results party in Concord, supporters were being turned away before polling had even closed. Few were doubting he would win; the question was only by how much. In her concession speech delivered from Southern New Hampshire University in Hooksett, Clinton said: â€œI know I have some work to do.â€\\x9d Former president Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea stood by her side. Clinton, who called Sanders earlier in the evening, congratulated her rival and said of his supporters: â€œEven if they are not supporting me now, I support them.â€\\x9d Senior Sanders staff see this decisive win in New Hampshire as their ticket to the genuine national campaign momentum that has so far proved difficult to achieve. Chief adviser Tad Devine told the the he is increasingly confident of securing union support to help the campaign in Nevada, the scene of their next and perhaps most important showdown with Clinton. â€œPeople need to understand something,â€\\x9d said a passionate Devine. â€œWe are a better campaign. We are a better resourced campaign. We have more people on the ground. We are demonstrating that resource superiority by going on television all across this country. We are redeploying hundreds of people who worked on this campaign [in New Hampshire]. We are happy to compete with them in the air and on the ground anywhere in this country.â€\\x9d Clintonâ€™s campaign had been bracing for a loss, with surrogates telling voters in a cafe earlier in the day that they were â€œlooking for a miracleâ€\\x9d. The former secretary of stateâ€™s 2008 comeback win in New Hampshire against Barack Obama added momentum to the prospect of the first female US president. But the state offered no such luck this time. Voters across the state said they were gripped by Sanders and Trump, perhaps more for what they represented rather than the nature as tried and tested candidates who could go the distance. From school gymnasiums to post offices in socially liberal cities and gun-toting conservative hamlets, they expressed widespread discontent with both Clinton in particular and the Republican partyâ€™s leadership as a whole. Chris Comfort, a 50-year-old retired plumber, had voted for Trump. â€œI really believe heâ€™s not owned by anyone,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAnd thatâ€™s a big thing in politics today.â€\\x9d Comfort said he also admired Sanders, whom he saw as atypical of the American political system: â€œHe is like Donald Trump in the fact that heâ€™s a man of principle â€“ he doesnâ€™t waver,â€\\x9d he said. â€œMr Sanders has always been for what he believes in, and I respect that.â€\\x9d The two parties will now criss-cross the country, with Sanders carrying his momentum to a Democratic caucus in Nevada on 20 February and Trump testing his popularity among southern Republicans in South Carolinaâ€™s primary on the same day. The campaigns will then turn their attentions towards Super Tuesday on 1 March, when 14 states will vote â€“ including seven in the south, where Clinton is expected to beat Sanders among African American voters. But Joseph Bafumi, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth University who has studied how new voters can be brought into a partyâ€™s coalition by outsider candidates, said Trump and Sanders had become â€œmuch more viable for the nominationâ€\\x9d by meeting expectations in New Hampshire on Tuesday. â€œItâ€™s more of a question of momentum,â€\\x9d he said of Trump, â€œbut it indicates to the rest of the country that his supporters can reliably go out and vote for him.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'David Moyes admits lack of summer recruitment could cost Sunderland dear David Moyes has made it plain that Sunderland will be practically doomed to relegation unless his squad is strengthened significantly in January. â€œI think we know weâ€™re going to have to improve on what weâ€™ve got to give ourselves a chance,â€\\x9d the manager said, following the 3-2 home defeat against Crystal Palace on Saturday. â€œUltimately you have to have good players on the pitch and, at the moment, weâ€™re not getting enough good players on the pitch. We need to get a better team, itâ€™s as simple as that. We need to get a team which can give us results.â€\\x9d This latest setback leaves Moyes with only one point from his first six Premier League games since succeeding Sam Allardyce, and Sunderland bottom of the table. â€œItâ€™s been a tough period because I wanted to be successful,â€\\x9d Moyes said. â€œI knew it wasnâ€™t going to be all easy, thatâ€™s for sure, but I did expect to find myself winning games. Now, though, we have to try and find a way to get out of it.â€\\x9d Although Moyes acknowledges that a lack of adequate recruitment, not only this summer but in previous years, lies at heart of Sunderlandâ€™s problems, he is adamant that his existing players need to assume responsibility for the defensive negligence which, once again, cost them dear as they squandered a 2-0 lead against Palace. This, it seems, is absolutely not the time for tea and sympathy. â€œI donâ€™t know that Iâ€™m necessarily an arm-around-the-shoulder man,â€\\x9d Moyes said. â€œI want to see men stand up and take responsibility, be tough and take the challenge on. At the moment weâ€™re not doing the basics well enough; not heading it and kicking it when we get the chance or doing the picking up and marking we need to do. â€œThe players need to take responsibility. It canâ€™t always be me leading them by the hand and showing them where they should be and what they should do.â€\\x9d Moyes â€“ who has managed Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad â€“ regarded Palaceâ€™s stoppage-time winning goal as a case in point, with an unmarked Christian Benteke heading home a free-kick. â€œBentekeâ€™s arguably the best header of the ball in the Premier League and nobody got close,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe gave him a free run and jump.â€\\x9d Despite Sunderland making eight summer signings, they failed to secure the striker Moyes craved to support Jermain Defoe, who scored twice against Palace; they also failed to re-sign Yann Mâ€™Vila, the former France midfielder who shone on Wearside last season while on loan from Rubin Kazan, and lost YounÃ¨s Kaboul, a key defender, to Watford. Before leaving to coach England in mid-July Allardyce had become deeply concerned by the lack of a single signing and Moyes was left playing catch-up. â€œWeâ€™re probably paying the price for not recruiting earlier,â€\\x9d the Scot said. â€œBut what would you say about the year before that or the year before that? Would you say weâ€™re paying the price for recruitment then or are there other reasons?â€\\x9d Jan Kirchhoff shared his managerâ€™s dismay. â€œA shocking result,â€\\x9d the former Bayern Munich midfielder said. â€œWe led 2-0 but we didnâ€™t all have the same idea about what to do next and we threw it away. â€œAs players we have to take 100% responsibility. We get well prepared before the games. Itâ€™s up to us to communicate on the pitch. We need leadership down there, people who are willing to take the lead. We have to get our shape back and have one clear idea of what weâ€™re doing.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Tottenham and Danny Rose punish wasteful Liverpool to claim draw JÃ¼rgen Klopp leaned back in his chair, threw a glance to the skies, and wore the expression of a man who had just been told the last bus home had been cancelled. â€œOh my God,â€\\x9d he said, exhaling deeply. The information he was trying to take in actually concerned one of the decisive moments of Liverpoolâ€™s 1-1 draw with Tottenham. It was a moment that might have turned one point into an excellent three. With one of their crisp breaks Georginio Wijnaldum slipped the ball to Adam Lallana, who pushed the move onwards and the ball across goal for Sadio ManÃ© to tap in. Up went the officialâ€™s flag and the strike was disallowed for a very tight offside. â€œWhat can I say?â€\\x9d Klopp said. â€œIt was a wonderful goal, huh? Brilliant play. It happens.â€\\x9d He sounded phlegmatic but looked slightly crestfallen. Despite the positives he can take from a complicated early season cluster of games all away from home, he made no bones about his disappointment that there were no more points on the board to show for it. â€œWe have not the most easy starting programme. Four points from nine is not what I wanted but itâ€™s OK. Thatâ€™s our platform.â€\\x9d Tottenhamâ€™s platform shows five points from nine but in terms of the teamâ€™s energy levels and attacking zest there has to be more to come from Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s team. For much of this tussle they toiled, they endeavoured, but clear chances did not come easily. The attacking prowess of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and the newcomer Vincent Janssen is yet to really catch fire this season. Pochettino didnâ€™t seem to mind too much if itâ€™s been a slow burner up until this point. â€œLast season Harry scored in game 10 and was top scorer. I would sign up again for that,â€\\x9d he smiled. Liverpool had more than enough chances to win, quite apart from the mysterious offside call. From the start the thrust of ManÃ© and trickery of Philippe Coutinho tested Tottenham. They set about the challenge here with swift movement and energy. With half-time approaching, Liverpool were handed a clear opportunity to turn their attacking promise into something concrete with a penalty. The referee Bobby Madley saw Ã‰rik Lamela catch Roberto Firmino at the edge of the box and pointed to the spot. It was down to James Milner, who had been filling in unfussily at left-back, to make the difference. He slammed his shot past Michel Vorm. Tottenham needed a response, a shot of energy, of inspiration after the break. But it was Liverpool who restarted with more intent: Wijnaldum scooped over; the impressive JoÃ«l Matip skimmed a header off the top of the crossbar. Pochettinoâ€™s frustration was growing but he later credited his teamâ€™s resolve for summoning enough pressure to equalise. Danny Rose escaped the general congestion and was allowed plenty of space to pick his spot when Eric Dierâ€™s cross was knocked towards him. Rose beat Simon Mignolet at the near post, releasing a wave of pent-up Tottenham angst. â€œ I am very pleased with the reaction, the effort and character we showed because it wasnâ€™t easy,â€\\x9d assessed Pochettino, who had to rebalance his team when Kyle Walker felt sick. Dier switched effortlessly to right-back, and the attack was rearranged. They could have even won it with Toby Alderweireldâ€™s powerful header, which inspired the agile, twisting, save of the day from Mignolet. The fact it was only one vital stop meant something to Klopp in measuring his teamâ€™s progress, as the keeper had been incredibly busy in the same fixture last year. â€œSimon saved our life last time. Today he had one brilliant save,â€\\x9d Klopp said. Liverpool had late chances to clinch it themselves but it was not to be and the manager preached the possibilities he can see in his team, even if there is more polish to come. â€œThis game showed again what we can do. We were really flexible and offensive and played football, had wonderful moments with passing and direction. I wish we would have won it but we have to accept the point and itâ€™s OK. Thatâ€™s what we have to show in each game.â€\\x9d Pochettino bade farewell to a large chunk of his players on international duty thankful to have avoided a nasty slip. He feels he is â€œmonthsâ€\\x9d away from having his squad where he wants it to be in order to truly compete. He is not the only manager who has lamented the difficulty in finding a sharp groove after a truncated, post-European Championship pre-season. â€œThis is not a perfect break,â€\\x9d Pochettino says. â€œAll the players involved [in the Euros] go again to the national team. It is difficult because some players are going, some will play, others no. We need maybe a few months to get all in the same level. Itâ€™s crazy.â€\\x9d No doubt there is more to come from both Tottenham and Liverpool.',\n",
              "  \"Hacked Powell emails: Trump a 'pariah' but would rather not vote for Clinton A series of leaks of email exchanges involving the former US secretary of state Colin Powell have revealed a stinging rebuke of Donald Trump, as well as lesser criticism of Hillary and Bill Clinton. Powell, George W Bushâ€™s chief diplomat from 2001 to 2005, called his fellow Republican a â€œnational disgraceâ€\\x9d and an â€œinternational pariahâ€\\x9d. Personal email exchanges leaked on Tuesday and Wednesday reveal the retired four-star generalâ€™s contempt for Trump, whose conspiracy theories surrounding Barack Obamaâ€™s place of birth Powell also labels as â€œracistâ€\\x9d. â€œYup, the whole birther movement was racist,â€\\x9d Powell wrote to his former aide in emails first reported by Buzzfeed News, referring to conspiracy theories that suggest Obama was not born in the US. â€œThatâ€™s what the 99% believe. â€œWhen Trump couldnâ€™t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim. As I have said before, â€˜What if he was?â€™ Muslims are born as Americans everyday.â€\\x9d Powellâ€™s emails surfaced on the website DCLeaks.com, which has previously featured other hacks into prominent Republicans and Democrats. Bushâ€™s former top diplomat, who has served in three Republican administrations, confirmed the exchanges were his but declined to comment any further. In another alleged exchange, reported by the New York Post, Powell told Democratic donor Jeffrey Leeds he would not vote for Hillary Clinton while citing tabloid rumors about Bill Clintonâ€™s private life. â€œI would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect,â€\\x9d Powell said. â€œA 70-year person with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational, with a husband still dâ€”ing bimbos at home (according to the NYP).â€\\x9d Powell told the New York Post he did not recall that particular exchange when asked about its authenticity. While it is unclear who is responsible for hacking into Powellâ€™s emails, the website DCLeaks reportedly has ties to the Russian government. When the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s emails were leaked in July, just ahead of the partyâ€™s national convention, the FBI said it believed Russia was behind the hack. Powellâ€™s own email use has become a focal point in the controversy surrounding Clintonâ€™s use of a private server. During an interview with FBI investigators, the Democratic nominee said Powell had advised her to use a personal email and that he did the same while serving as secretary of state. Powell later accused Clintonâ€™s campaign of trying to throw him under the bus, but House Democrats last week released email correspondence between the two in which Powell discussed how to get around state department restrictions on both personal email and devices. Even so, Powell voices his frustration with the Clinton campaign in one of the latest leaked emails, reported by NBCNews. â€œI have told Hillearyâ€™s [sic] minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try,â€\\x9d Powell wrote.\",\n",
              "  \"Seth Meyers on Trump the candidate: 'I think he knows he'd hate the job' Few comedians have been having as much fun with this presidential election as the host of NBCâ€™s Late Night with Seth Meyers. Meyersâ€™ sharply satirical examination of Trumpworld â€“ A Closer Look â€“ has established him, arguably with the exception of Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night Live, among the pre-eminent political late night satirists of 2016. And with a nightly audience of 1.5 million, he has found a distinctive political voice. â€œWhen Trump came down the escalator to announce his candidacy we thought weâ€™d get two weeks of material of it,â€\\x9d Meyers said this week before taping a new show partially devoted to Republican preoccupations with sex. â€œWe thought heâ€™d tease and get the kind of attention from saying he might run. â€œBut we never thought heâ€™d go through with it.â€\\x9d What started as material for comedy soon transformed into something else entirely. â€œWith each of [Trumpâ€™s] successes,â€\\x9d Meyers said, â€œthereâ€™s been a stock-taking of how different this felt from any election thatâ€™s come before it. Itâ€™s been a gift, but a gift that wears on you. Whenever we have a hiatus week, part of what makes it relaxing is to get away from this.â€\\x9d On Friday, with 11 days to go, the campaign was thrown into turmoil by the latest turn in the drama over Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails. That took the spotlight away from Trump â€“ most likely, momentarily. â€œI think he found an audience and then cultivated what that audience wanted,â€\\x9d Meyers said. â€œI think audience reaction is what heâ€™s most concerned with.â€\\x9d Itâ€™s the kind of observation a performer would make. â€œHe has a very good antenna for it,â€\\x9d Meyers continued. â€œHe loves playing the big room â€“ those 20,000 seat arenas â€“ and thatâ€™s why he canâ€™t be bothered to show up to most interviews. Heâ€™d rather phone it in.â€\\x9d Some have suggested that however much Trump protests that he wants to be president, in a sense he knows he is not the man for the job. He may be vain and thin-skinned, but that doesnâ€™t quite account for the self-destructive fights he picks. Meyers believes the reality may be that Trump sees himself as a reluctant saviour. â€œâ€˜If only heâ€™d run, heâ€™d be the solution to all our problemsâ€™ is a lot more fun than actually having to solve those problems,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe havenâ€™t shied away from using words like â€˜racistâ€™ and â€˜liarâ€™, but our theory is that this got out of hand for him. â€œHe didnâ€™t think heâ€™d get this far, but I think he knows heâ€™d hate the job.â€\\x9d Over the past 18 months, the conventional wisdom about what a candidate can or cannot do has been thoroughly overturned. â€œWe were told an outside candidate couldnâ€™t upset the apple cart of what the GOP is,â€\\x9d Meyers said. â€œBut with each outrage, people have said theyâ€™d leave, thinking other people would follow them, but no one did.â€\\x9d Before he took the Late Night job two and a half years ago, as a speaker at the 2011 White House Correspondentsâ€™ Association Dinner, Meyers memorably asked whether Trump was planning to run as a Republican or as a joke. That was in the midst of the Trumpâ€™s â€œbirther campaignâ€\\x9d against Barack Obama, and Obama had already made fun of the businessman. Footage clearly shows Trump sitting stony faced as he endures Meyersâ€™ comedic attention. Some believe such ritualised humiliation steeled Trump to run. â€œMy worry was that the president had gone first and already told a lot of jokes about him and there would be audience exhaustion,â€\\x9d Meyers said. â€œTurned out people were happy to hear more jokes about him, but the first thing I heard when I stepped off the stage was to steer clear of him at the parties.â€\\x9d The next day, Trump started criticising Meyers and his performance. â€œWhen you talk about a gift,â€\\x9d Meyers said, â€œthatâ€™s the gift that keeps giving. Heâ€™s so transparent in his inability to take the high road and thatâ€™s the scariest thing about him â€“ how deep-seated his resentments are.â€\\x9d But has the rich seam of Trump comedic material let his opponent off lightly? â€œItâ€™s comical but itâ€™s harder to explain,â€\\x9d Meyers says about Clintonâ€™s emails, controversy over her family foundation and the WikiLeaks release of hacked Democratic party emails. â€œAnd weâ€™ve tried. â€œThe bigger problem we have, though, is there have been so few days when whatâ€™s happening on the Clinton side has been a better story than whatâ€™s happening on the Trump side. â€œWe want to be fair, but we donâ€™t feel that being fair is an equal number of jokes on each candidate. Thatâ€™s a false equivalency. For us, itâ€™s about chasing the best story for jokes and itâ€™s rare that sheâ€™s a better joke than him.â€\\x9d The now infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump is heard to brag about his ability to kiss and touch women without their consent emerged from NBC. The network has not escaped accusations of political bias. But as Meyers pointed out in a segment to camera last week, many of the Republican partyâ€™s own problems appear to stem from living within a bubble of highly partisan media information. In 10 days, after election day, the banquet of political comedy will have been consumed. Will Meyers feel bereft? Or over-indulged and suffering indigestion? Meyers recalls his time at Saturday Night Live, when the cool draft of post-election comedown could be felt ahead of the vote. In this cycle, however, itâ€™s not clear what will come next. â€œWe didnâ€™t know we wanted to take it here so I wouldnâ€™t want to predict where weâ€™d take it next,â€\\x9d he says. â€œDonald Trump seems to be saying he thinks the election will have a long tail. â€œI donâ€™t know if the first 100 days of the next presidency will be about the defeated candidate still making a lot of noise.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  'The view on the Lloyds sale: better never than late Students of privatisation over the years have learnt to be grateful for small mercies. It is, for sure, better that George Osborne has, for the moment, pulled back from dumping the taxpayersâ€™ shares in Lloyds on to a bearish market, than it would have been for him to plough stubbornly ahead. Before last yearâ€™s election the chancellor bragged that the national debt would fall faster than expected, a claim that turned out to depend on selling things like Lloyds, which flatters the books but does nothing at all for the public sectorâ€™s balance sheet. So it is a relief to learn, now the election is won, that the desperation for cash upfront can be somewhat tempered by concern about the available price. But Mr Osborne is merely slowing the pace, not changing course, on a deeply ideological privatisation programme. There has not been the same noise as there was when the Thatcher government urged everybody to Tell Sid about the British Gas prospectus, nor the same buzz as there was when middle Britons who had never previously thought of buying stocks posted off a cheque for BT shares. Quietly, however, Mr Osborne has been breaking records. The Press Association tots up a total of Â£26bn in asset sales last year â€“ including the stateâ€™s Eurostar stake, 30% of the Royal Mail and a slice of Lloyds. This surpasses the previous high of Â£20bn, set way back in 1987, when Rolls-Royce and British Airways were sold. Back then, a Conservative government also exhibited a strong doctrinaire preference for private over public ownership. But after the mix of inflation, stagnation and strikes which had characterised Britainâ€™s economic history in the 1970s, the privatisation argument had some appeal to middle-of-the-road pragmatists too, and especially for the likes of BA and Rolls, players in increasingly competitive markets, where commercial freedoms seemed important. The contrast with today is stark. The great scars on the economyâ€™s back in 2016 were not put there by strike-happy, overstaffed nationalised industries, but rather by predatory and under-regulated banks. The public enemy should, surely, not be the sort of plodding bureaucrat who used to run the Yorkshire Water Board, but rather the slickly suited profiteer who got paid an order of magnitude more for gambling with other peopleâ€™s money. Lloyds and the other big banks were virtually all disgraced, either in the crisis itself, or else in one or another of the scandals that broke in its aftermath: mass mis-selling, Libor rigging and the laundering of Mexican drug money. Todayâ€™s middle-of-the-road pragmatists, one might imagine, would be attracted to breaking up the big banks and setting up state-run challengers, not inviting the bankers to return to business as normal by selling the public stake. Finance is a special case after the crisis, perhaps, but new blights are emerging on the wider record of privatisation too. This young year has already seen MPs condemn a weak regulator for allowing excessive water charges, and David Cameron blast the energy giants for failing to cut bills in line with tumbling costs in world markets. In telecoms â€“ which used to be deemed the archetypal privatisation success â€“ BT got the green light to acquire EE, a move away from the promised privatisation end-point, of a competitive market where the customer is sovereign, and a move towards an oligopoly, where a few big firms call the shots. So if there is one cheer for the delay in the Lloyds sale, to earn three the chancellor would have had to cancel the whole flotation, unless and until it could be convincingly fitted into a fundamental programme of bank reform of which there is no sign. But then the chancellorâ€™s scramble to find British assets to sell into the hands of a Chinese communist state suggests that privatisation is today more of a product of compulsive habit rather than critical thought. It once had its pragmatic advocates. These days, however, privatisation looks like a triumph of the rightwing heart over the dispassionate head.',\n",
              "  \"Can Britain's bureaucracy handle a Brexit? Following a vote to leave the EU, the UK would face complex negotiations to manage its withdrawal. Given the all-encompassing nature of EU membership, a crucial question is whether Whitehall â€“ particularly the Foreign Office (FCO) and Cabinet Office â€“ is sufficiently equipped and resourced to achieve a satisfactory outcome (whatever that might entail). No country has left the EU, so there is no template to follow. We do know that negotiations would need to address both a British withdrawal and its new relationship with the EU, and be ratified by the remaining EU member states as well as the UK and European parliaments. There are several possibilities for this: Britain could seek to be part of the European Economic Area, following the Norwegian model (although David Cameron has ruled this out), or instead emulate a more detached Swiss-style relationship through the European Free Trade Area. A special, British model is also possible, as the UK expects more than to be grouped with Norway and Switzerland (pdf) in the event of a Brexit. Whatever the decision, at least three new treaties may be required, giving an idea of the scale of what must be agreed within the two-year notice period â€“ although there are provisions for this to be extended. How will this process be managed? When states become EU members they must agree and transpose into law 100,000-plus pages of the EU acquis (accumulated legislation), which gives us an idea of what reverse-engineering this process might entail. All aspects of UK membership would have to be addressed, with no part of Whitehall unaffected. This will pose a significant administrative challenge domestically and in Brussels. Sophisticated machinery exists to manage British European policy, which would logically underpin the negotiating process â€“ although unsurprisingly the government refuses to comment on specific arrangements in the event of a leave vote. The so-called triangle of the FCO, Cabinet Office and UK permanent representation in Brussels (UKRep) oversees European policy coordination, but each government department manages the details of their specific policy responsibilities, while the Treasury also has a significant say. The Cabinet Office would be the logical domestic hub for the negotiations, with the FCO contributing expertise in terms of treaty-making and using the UKâ€™s broader diplomatic network in pursuit of an agreement. UKRep could be expected to lead negotiations in Brussels while also providing a conduit for on-the-ground intelligence and advice on negotiating strategy. The economic significance of leaving the EU means significant Treasury involvement should also be expected. The process will require careful management and political leadership to contain tensions over priorities. Stretched to the limit Do the main institutional actors have the resources, capacity, headcount and expertise to do this, while simultaneously managing the ongoing business of government? Although Cabinet Office staff numbers have risen since 2013, it will require additional resources, particularly in expertise, to manage the domestic component of the negotiations. In Brussels, the scope of the agreement the UK will be pursuing will place considerable demands on UKRep. Officials will be seeking to persuade soon-to-be former EU partners, some of whom may be ambivalent about Britainâ€™s decision to withdraw and feel no great compunction to make things easy. (Indeed, some may wish to make withdrawal as painful as possible pour encourager les autres.) This in turn will place a burden on the FCO, which is currently enduring one of its most challenging periods in terms of pressure on resources and capabilities. In its 2014 report (pdf), the foreign affairs select committee declared that as a consequence of the stringent budget settlement imposed under the 2010 spending review â€“ described as one of the tightest in Whitehall (pdf) â€“ the FCO â€œis being stretched almost to the limitâ€\\x9d. Doing more with less has been a constant requirement of the FCO in recent years. Moreover, dealing with intense periods of EU activity is not new, as seen during Britainâ€™s six-month EU presidency in 2005 when its European team expanded to 200. But Brexit negotiations will be of a different magnitude. It will not be just a matter of reassigning resources for the duration of the negotiations, there is also the question of whether the FCO can access the required European expertise. At the same time, it will be seeking to manage the impact of a Brexit on UK relations with third parties, as well as dealing with the ongoing foreign policy matters for which it is responsible. The UKâ€™s administrative structures will face a test unprecedented in scale and complexity â€“ and this will be happening after a decade or more of cuts in resources and spending. While Britainâ€™s coordination machinery is considered efficient and effective, this alone is not enough to guarantee success. For policymakers and politicians, the challenge will be to achieve the best possible deal with the resources available. Their ability to do this may well determine the quality of any final withdrawal agreement.

              "  'Greens call for royal commission to examine â€˜breaking up banksâ€™ The Greens want to use a royal commission to examine whether banks should be broken up to split the retail arms from their investment and financial advice arms in response to recent scandals. The Greens banking and finance policy also calls for increased penalties for white-collar crime, capping ATM fees and forcing banks to allow portable bank accounts which allow easy transfers, similar to taking mobile phone numbers between companies. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, a former banker, has been calling for a royal commission into the sector, which has been dogged by scandals over poor financial advice, insider trading and rigging interest rates. After resisting a royal commission, Labor followed suit and has called for a royal commission into the banks following the scandals. The Greens policy now goes a step further, outlining that a banking royal commission would â€œfully examine the problems associated with the â€˜vertically integratedâ€™ model. â€œThis would including looking at â€˜breaking up the banksâ€™ to separate retail banking from financial advice and investment banking,â€\\x9d the policy statement says. The Greens would increase penalties for white-collar crime in line with other advanced economies. For example, for criminal offences such as insider trading, Australia currently fines individuals $810,000 or three times the benefit gained, whichever is greater. The Greens propose an increase to $5m or three times the benefit gained â€“ a fine more in line with Canada and the United States. In the UK, the fine is not capped. Whistleblowers should be financially rewarded if their information leads to reclaimed money, according to the Greens, as is the case in the United States. The Greens would also â€œmake it illegalâ€\\x9d to charge excessive ATM fees and wants bank accounts to be fully portable through a common data system. â€œThe digital age makes â€˜identity transferâ€™ relatively easy,â€\\x9d says the policy. â€œPeople can carry mobile phone numbers from one provider to another. The same option should be available to consumers in banking.â€\\x9d The Greens would prohibit superannuation funds from direct borrowing to invest in housing, in line with a recommendation of the financial system inquiry by David Murray. â€œThe financial system inquiry warned that continued growth in borrowing for housing by superannuation funds could pose a risk to the financial system,â€\\x9d the policy says. While the Coalition rejected Murrayâ€™s recommendation, it did agree to work with regulators and the tax office to monitor the risk and report back to government. The Australian Bankersâ€™ Association rejected the policy saying it would trigger an economic downturn. ABA chief executive, Steven MÃ¼nchenberg, said Australia had some of the strongest banks in the world and the major banks are part of small group which have earned the high Standard & Poorâ€™s rating of AA-. â€œThis means that, even in times of global uncertainty and market volatility, Australiaâ€™s major banks are still able to raise the money needed from overseas investors to fund the Australian economy and meet the financial needs of businesses and households,â€\\x9d he said in a statement. â€œThis major economic advantage would be lost under the Greensâ€™ policy, triggering an economic downturn.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'The movies go to war: museum explores real to reel conflict After intensively watching death, destruction and misery in about 100 war movies, Imperial War Museum curator Laura Clouting admits she needs a change of pace: â€œIâ€™m absolutely dying to watch something a little more lighthearted. I need some Jurassic Park, some Sister Act!â€\\x9d Clouting is curating a major new exhibition that goes behind the scenes of some of the most famous war movies, from The Dam Busters to Das Boot to War Horse. Opening to the public on Friday, the immersive show will explore a movie genre which shows little sign of going away, or waning in popularity. Clouting has, necessarily, sat through lots of movies. â€œIt makes me realise just how big and how enduring the genre is, there are so many war films. Cinema has got this appetite for understanding conflict and it is because war is the most extreme human experience, whether you are a soldier or a civilian.â€\\x9d The museum last held a war movie show in 1970; a very different exhibition in that technology meant they could only use stills. This time visitors will be able to watch lots of excerpts, whether Alec Guinness blowing up the bridge on the River Kwai, or Donald Duck doing his bit for the collective effort during the second world war. There will also be props, costumes and scripts loaned to help shine a brighter light on particular films. For example, Lawrence of Arabia, in which David Lean cast the statuesque blond figure of Peter Oâ€™Toole to play TE Lawrence who was, in truth, barely 5ft 5in. The exhibition includes one of his robes, his rifle and a letter that may surprise visitors who have read accounts of Lawrenceâ€™s mania for self publicity, with journalist Lowell Thomas writing of his â€œgenius for backing into the limelightâ€\\x9d. A 1927 letter to director Rex Ingram rails against talk of his role in the Arab revolt being made into a Hollywood film. He writes: â€œI would hate to see myself parodied on a pitiful basis of my record of what the fellows with me did.â€\\x9d Elsewhere there is the suit worn by Liam Neeson in Schindlerâ€™s List, the military cap worn by Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler in Downfall, and a Santa hat worn by Jake Gyllenhaalâ€™s bored marine character in Jarhead. In another compare-and-contrast section, footage from one of the most popular war films, Steven Spielbergâ€™s Saving Private Ryan, is shown with actual footage from the D-Day landings. Clouting said the show was â€œan idea that the museum had wanted to grapple with for a long timeâ€\\x9d. A good peg arrived in the 100th anniversary not only of the Battle of the Somme, but also the film that the War Office commissioned, a remarkable documentary and propaganda film that was watched by about 20 million people over six weeks in 1916. It includes many smiling, cheerful Tommies but there are also far darker moments. â€œIt is quite frank,â€\\x9d said Clouting. â€œThe film does not hold back from showing you images of the dead or the wounded.â€\\x9d Clouting is hoping there are many films included that visitors will recall with fondness. But there are also movies covered where film makers have got it very wrong. The woefully inaccurate U-571, for example, which was discussed in parliament after it portrayed US navy submariners capturing an Enigma cipher machine from the Germans. An arguably worse example is Objective Burma, which has Errol Flynn leading American paratroopers defeating the Japanese, ignoring the fact that it was a largely British and Commonwealth conflict. â€œThere was such outrage that it was banned from British cinemas within a week,â€\\x9d said Clouting. â€œPeople are furious with this film for making out that the Americans won [that conflict].â€\\x9d â€¢ Real to Reel: A Century of War Movies at IWM London, 1 July to 8 January 2017 â€¢ This article was amended on 30 June 2016. An earlier version misnamed the curator of the exhibition as Lucy Clouting. This has been corrected to say Laura Clouting.',\n",
              "  \"China tantalized by US election mayhem and prospect of 'thug' Trump as president His detractors concur that Donald Trump is the most unpalatable candidate for the White House in the history of the United States. But almost 8,000km away in Beijing, Chinaâ€™s authoritarian rulers appear to think he might be just the man for the job. Veteran pekingologists suspect the Chinese leadership has been secretly rooting for a Trump victory, wagering his elevation to the Oval Office would strike a body blow to their greatest rival. â€œIt was Mao Zedong who said: â€˜Without destruction there can be no constructionâ€™. And, if I interpret him correctly, Donald Trump is the suicide bomber of American politics,â€\\x9d said Orville Schell, the head of the Centre on US-China Relations at New Yorkâ€™s Asia Society. â€œHe wants to just bring the whole house down and start over. And I think there is an element [of that] that is quite tantalizing to China.â€\\x9d Schell noted how Chinaâ€™s strongman president, Xi Jinping, had repeatedly declared himself a fan of Chairman Maoâ€™s teachings. â€œAnd of course the key principle of Maoâ€™s rule was â€œda nao tian gongâ€\\x9d - â€œmake disorder under heavenâ€\\x9d. I think Trump has every promise of doing that in America.â€\\x9d Harvard Universityâ€™s Roderick MacFarquhar is another veteran China scholar who suspects the Communist party has been crossing its fingers for a Trump triumph. â€œI think they would see him as an enormous opportunity,â€\\x9d said MacFarquhar, a former Labour party MP, adding: â€œI donâ€™t think theyâ€™d see Hillary as any kind of opportunity at all.â€\\x9d Party newspapers have revelled in this yearâ€™s scandal-tainted race for the White House, spinning each sordid turn as proof of the perks of one-party rule. â€œThe â€˜master of democracyâ€™ should swallow its super confidence and arrogance,â€\\x9d the Communist partyâ€™s official mouthpiece, the Peopleâ€™s Daily, smirked in a recent editorial. Nick Bisley, an Asia expert from La Trobe University in Melbourne, said the ignominious election battle had handed Beijing an example of the United Statesâ€™ â€œdebased political cultureâ€\\x9d and further exposed democracy as â€œa vulgar, deeply inefficient and chaotic form of governmentâ€\\x9d. â€œIf you are a propaganda officer in the bureau in Beijing crafting your anti-democratic messaging youâ€™ve got a lot to work with.â€\\x9d MacFarquhar, the author of a seminal work on Maoâ€™s tumultuous 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution, said that while Beijing would now regard a Trump White House as unlikely, President Xi would have taken particular delight in watching the Republican candidate â€œupendâ€\\x9d the political establishment in a way that was redolent of those 10 years of chaos. There were parallels, he said, between Trumpâ€™s attack on the system and the way in which Chairman Mao - to a far more devastating degree - had unleashed his Red Guards on the Communist party in 1966. â€œSaying that your opponent should be jailed and, if he became president, she would be jailed, that really is American-style Cultural Revolution stuff,â€\\x9d MacFarquhar said. â€œEven if he quietly folds his tent and goes back to his reality television [after the election], he has thrown a bomb into the system and the Chinese canâ€™t but like that.â€\\x9d More than merely wallowing in the current mayhem, however, some scholars suspect there are those in Beijing actively hoping for a Trump victory on 8 November, even as the chances of that happening appear to fade. Schell said he believed Chinaâ€™s â€œmore-than-flirtations with Putinâ€\\x9d and embrace of the Philippinesâ€™ hardman president Rodrigo Duterte showed its rulers saw the benefits of â€œmaking a deal with a good thug, rather than with somebody constrained by principle.â€\\x9d â€œAnd surely in Donald Trump we have the ne plus ultra of American thuggery.â€\\x9d â€œI think they would feel that there were all sorts of opportunities with Trump,â€\\x9d agreed MacFarquhar. â€œSome of them might be more dangerous than others. He would be an uncertain commodity, like he is for the Americansâ€¦ But Hillary was a certain commodity - and not one they liked.â€\\x9d MacFarquhar said part of Beijingâ€™s attraction to Trump was simply a question of its dislike of Clinton and her support for human rights and Barack Obamaâ€™s â€œpivot to Asiaâ€\\x9d. â€œThey think she is a hardliner on China, which Iâ€™m sure she is compared to Obama. So any rival to Hillary who might win would have been a blessing for them.â€\\x9d But the Harvard academic said Trumpâ€™s statements questioning US support for its Nato allies and defence treaty with Japan meant he would be â€œan absolute giftâ€\\x9d to Beijing as it strove for superpower status. â€œTrump - even though he is â€˜anti-China, anti-China, anti-Chinaâ€™ - has always talked about deals. Thatâ€™s his shtickâ€¦ [and] the Chinese would be only too happy to do a deal with Trump if that was on the cards.â€\\x9d For all Trumpâ€™s affection for the word China, few experts dare predict the impact his presidency might have on ties between Washington and Beijing. Schell said he believed Duterte, who recently travelled to China to seek an unexpected rapprochement with its leaders, could be â€œthe most revelatory model for what we might get with Trumpâ€\\x9d. Following the Filipino presidentâ€™s lead, Trump might seek some sort of new arrangement with Xi Jinping that would be beneficial to Beijing. If that didnâ€™t happen, â€œat least they get a blank slate, at least they are dealing with someone else - and they are not bad at making deals with dictatorsâ€\\x9d. â€œI think Trump is our Mussolini,â€\\x9d Schell concluded. â€œAnd the Chinese have always gotten along fine with people like that.â€\\x9d\",\n",
              "  \"Dublin v London: what's the best bet for rich bankers? A city that is just an hourâ€™s plane ride from London, where people speak English and which, crucially, is still part of the EU, Dublin has been marketing itself as an alternative destination for bankers and financiers should their companies decide to move jobs out of the UK. But what, if anything, can Irelandâ€™s capital offer the Cityâ€™s high flyers? Property The first consideration is, of course, location and if Kensington (the London borough with the highest proportion of those employed in banking/finance) is soon to be emptied, its designer-clothing-clad former residents might feel at home in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock. The coastal village south of Dublinâ€™s city centre has the capitalâ€™s highest proportion of people working in finance. According to the 2011 census, 16% of Blackrockâ€™s working population are in banking/finance, compared with 20% of those in Kensington. The good news is that property in Blackrock is a snip compared with the London borough: in June 2016, the average property price was Â£512,629 in Blackrock, less than half Kensingtonâ€™s going rate (Â£1.2m). The disparity between rents is even greater: in the year ending March 2016, the average monthly rental for a three-bed property in Kensington/Chelsea stood at Â£5,174 compared with Â£1,510 in Blackrock in the year ending 30 June, and the savings increase for people looking at four-bedroom properties. But while property may be cheaper, its availability is more problematic. According to figures provided by the property website Daft.ie, in the first three months of 2016 just 64 properties were put up for sale in Blackrock, compared with 668 in Kensington and Chelsea. So the chances of finding the kind of high-end property Ross Oâ€™Carroll Kelly would proudly inhabit may be more difficult. Ronan Lyons, an economist at Trinity College Dublin and author of the Daft.ie reports, said when it came to availability, it was important to take into account the relative size of the two cities. However, he added: â€œThe number of high-end properties in Dublin is very low, in a city growing rapidly and with a high presence of executives for foreign multinationals,â€\\x9d he said. â€œLike London, Dublin is a city that has been forced by regulation to grow out, rather than up, which has made housing unnecessarily scarce and expensive at all ends of the market.â€\\x9d Quality of life Dubliners have taken great pleasure in recent surveys that compare the Irish capital favourably with other cities of the world. One suggested it was one of the worldâ€™s friendliest cities and recent Mercer indexes ranked it better than London on both quality of life and cost of living. The Irish capital also fares better than London when it comes to self-reported health. Just over 50% of Londoners rated their health as â€œvery goodâ€\\x9d in the 2011 census, versus 63% of Dubliners. In Kensington 57.5% said they were in â€œvery goodâ€\\x9d health: in Blackrock the figure was 71%. Taxes and earnings On this subject the news is only bad for high flyers. Wages are lower and â€“ despite its reputation as a paragon of low tax â€“ income taxes are higher in Dublin than in London. Letâ€™s say a brokerage transferring its workforce from London to Dublin decided to continue paying its now Irish-based workforce London salaries. An average broker, who according to the Office for National Statistics could expect to earn Â£128,231 before tax, would have take-home pay of Â£77,500 if they lived in the UK but Â£72,290 in Ireland using August exchange rates. Ireland is a more attractive proposition for companies, however, with a 12.5% corporate tax rate, compared with the UKâ€™s 20% rate. Private schools There are more private secondary schools within a three-mile radius of Kensington (67) than there are in the whole of Ireland (52), and almost twice as many as in Dublin (35). But if you are going to live anywhere, then the local authority which contains Blackrock (DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown) has the countryâ€™s highest concentration of private schools, with seven fee-paying schools per 100,000 population. Michelin stars and golf clubs When it comes to entertainment, Dublin might have some growing to do if it is going to attract the banking set. While the city is renowned for its pubs, its residents are relatively starved of Michelin star restaurants compared with London. There are five in Dublin against 65 in London. Translated per head of population, that equates to 7.5 Michelin starred restaurants per 100,000 people in London, compared with 3.7 in Dublin. There are five Michelin starred establishments in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea while, as of early October, Blackrock has only one â€“ Heron & Grey. While it may not have as many fine dining options, Dublin is a golferâ€™s dream. For those intent on spoiling a good walk, there are a whopping 113 clubs within an hourâ€™s drive of Main Street in Blackrock, well ahead of the 30 golf clubs (excluding pitch and putts) within an hourâ€™s drive of Kensington High Street.\",\n",

He is the mirror of our emptiness, the emptying out that has been happening to our country for a very long time. He is an outcome of a two-party system that has consistently ignored the needs and wishes of the majority of Americans for generations. He is the manifestation of celebrity culture where those that have everything are worshipped for their shiny success and in the world of celebrity that shininess is a stand in for principles, substance and moral values. He is personality over planning, symbol over substance, insipidness over insightfulness. He is the outcome of the rich being able to buy anything, including our democracy. He is an outcome of centuries of underlying unaddressed, massively denied and metastasized racism. He is the hatred of the poor and the needy, the denigration of immigrants and those seeking refuge from the devastation of US wars and imperialism. He is the outcome of an insidious exceptionalism â€“ the bedrock belief that American lives are more precious and valuable than any Others, those that we stigmatize, bomb, torture, murder, control, invade and whose economies we trash, whose resources we devour, whose futures we steal. He is the outcome of fear which masquerades as bullying. He is the manifestation of patriarchy and the endlessly indoctrinated belief that only a father will save us even though the mainly men who have been determining reality for this country and the planet have led us to near ruin.

He is the outcome of an insanely violent culture, increasingly unkind with more bullying, that normalizes cruelty, industrializes punishment and declares endless war on its own citizens. He is the consolidation of a government that devotes huge portions of its budget to building an imperial military rather than feeding and educating its own people, that wreaks havoc on the world rather than fighting climate change, that promotes the pillaging of the earth rather than ending violence against the people who inhabit it, that forces working people to police the world rather than providing them with meaningful work. He is the product of a country with the most number of armed citizens in the world, where the average of 89 firearms for every 100 people leads to more deaths at the hands of fellow countrymen every year than international terrorists have killed ever. He is the outcome of a country where police consistently murder Black women and men with little to no repercussions and millions are living in perpetual incarceration. He is the outcome of corrupt, self-seeking, extremist politicians who ignore the constitution and make it their business to refuse any meaningful legislation from getting passed. He is the outcome of an insidious, selfish morality where getting what you want, making money at any expense is the credo and how we behave, who we hurt, or destroy, what earth we eviscerate is inconsequential. He is the holographic representation of the failure of a country, our denial, our refusal to act and rise for each other and to take responsibility for what our government, corporations, military are doing across the world. He is a symptom of what happens when collective consciousness has divided and subdivided so many times within this neoliberal psychosis that we no longer know how to make alliances, build coalitions and have each otherâ€™s backs or stand with each other when the going gets rough. He is an outcome of a country with denial as thick as its amnesia. We come to honor and idolize war criminals and racists and sexists and corporates whoâ€™ve destroyed the lives of millions. He is an outcome of years and years of each of us being taught to fend for ourselves, fight for our own share, step over those who we are told are slower or weaker but who may in fact be deeper, more moral or more considered. He is an outcome of a world divided between winners and losers. He is an outcome of fatigue and privilege and disenchantment and hopelessness and exclusion. He is an outcome of cynicism and an imposed belief that there is nothing we can really do to overcome this corporate neoliberal imperialist racist sexist homphobic earth-hating transphobic system. The moment of America has arrived. This is our reckoning, our karma come to roost. It is way beyond the question of who we vote for in the upcoming election. It is a question of who we are. What is America? What kind of country do we want this to be? What values and principles do we hold and cherish? What will we do and what lengths will we go to, what collective imagination will we employ, what mighty love will we summon to ensure the ending of this violence, this hate, this destruction of our mother earth, this grotesque inequality of wealth, this mad and ferocious drive to our end? Hereâ€™s what Donald Trump is not: He is not us. He is not all of us. He is not the best of us. He is not inevitable. Let us take Trump at his word. Let him be our Unifier.',\n",
              "  'Blood test could identify people who will respond to antidepressants Scientists have developed a blood test that could identify which people with depression will respond to treatment so that patients can avoid spending months taking antidepressants that do not help them. The experts involved believe the breakthrough could lead to depressed patients receiving personalised treatments that are more likely to relieve their symptoms. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said that, if it worked, the test could prove to be a key moment in the quest for the holy grail of biological psychiatry. The scientists at Kingâ€™s College London behind the development claim that their test â€œaccurately and reliably predicts whether depressed patients will respond to common antidepressants, which could herald a new era of personalised treatment for people with depressionâ€\\x9d. If the test proves effective it is hoped that by measuring patientsâ€™ level of blood inflammation it would identify which of them would benefit from receiving antidepressants soon after their diagnosis to stop their condition worsening. About half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people. Currently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants, or combinations of them. That means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for 12 weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them. One in six Britons will suffer depression at some point in their life. Last year 61.5m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England. Researchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood, as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants. They found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants. Their findings have been reported in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology. â€œThe identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients,â€\\x9d said Prof Carmine Pariante from KCLâ€™s institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience. â€œThis study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy. Patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies, including the addition of other antidepressants or anti-inflammatory drugs,â€\\x9d Pariante added. Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: â€œFinding biological markers for depression (and other mental illnesses) has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry. â€œSuch a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression. It would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient.â€\\x9d But further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting, Hallstrom added. Stephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind, said: â€œWe welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems. These initial findings are interesting, but, as with all areas of mental health, there is still more research to be done.â€\\x9d Mental health problems, including depression, are estimated to cost Â£105bn a year in England. The World Health Organisation has predicted that by 2020 depression will be the second biggest cause of health problems in the world.',\n",
              "  'So what is Trumponomics? More of the same So Americaâ€™s ruling classes have lost to a billionaire who plays at being a man of the people. Donald Trump ran against the hierarchy of his own party, without the blessing of commentators or the big CEOs, without the speeches to Wall Street or the funding from Silicon Valley. Amid all the justifiable dismay expressed today, donâ€™t forget one thing: Hillary Clinton was the establishment candidate; it was Trump who ran as the perennially unfancied outsider. He remains an almost illicit politician, a preference you express in hushed tones. Look at the placards brandished last night by self-declared members of the â€œsilent majorityâ€\\x9d. Just over a month ago, I rang round Trump voters in West Virginia and Pennsylvania â€“ two of the states that went red last night. Among the things that struck me most forcibly was how sheepish they were about admitting publicly they were going to vote for the man. â€œHeâ€™s a jackass, but â€¦ â€\\x9d one began. Another: â€œI think heâ€™s a total idiot, but â€¦ â€\\x9d But Iâ€™ll back him. But who else is there? But Iâ€™ve had enough. That was the tenor of nearly all the conversations â€“ with a few citizens of one of the noisiest democracies on Earth then asking if I could keep their identities secret. Well, let me add another but. Trump is an outsider politician leading an insurgency of self-declared outsider Americans: the white men who feel homeless in their own country and the coal-mining and rustbelt states that got written off by both parties â€“ but that wonâ€™t produce outsider policies. A good chunk of the Trump base consists of people who consider themselves to be losers from four decades of political and economic orthodoxy. But Donald J Trump wonâ€™t be the president who reads the last rites for neoliberalism â€“ for the simple reason that the empty-headed narcissist has no idea what to replace it with. This isnâ€™t the mainstream view. Among the prefects of political and economic commentary, the standard thing to do this morning is to rehearse Trumpâ€™s fury at free trade, to look at the voters that most of them have never bothered talking to â€“ and to squawk that America has struck out in a new and radically different direction. Itâ€™s a revolution! The pitchforks finally have their leader! As Trump edged towards the 270-mark, one of the first emails I got was from a senior fund manager at the giant Fidelity group, declaring: â€œWe are heading into a world of unprecedented political risk which calls into question the pillars of the post-WWII settlement.â€\\x9d At least as far as the economics go, that is just overheated nonsense. First, it ignores just how protean Trumpâ€™s politics are. This is the man who just a few months ago in an off-the-record meeting at the New York Times told senior journalists that â€œeverything is negotiableâ€\\x9d. This is the Republican warrior whose most memorable photo is of him and his new wife laughing along with his VIP guests Bill and Hillary Clinton. This is the blowhard who canâ€™t help contradicting himself. Take out the contortions, exaggerations and outright lies from the standard Trump riff â€“ and you have next to nothing. All this makes him easily containable for the Republicans in the Senate and the House that heâ€™ll need to work with . What the head boys and head girls also miss is just how old-fashioned Trumponomics is. Look at the people around him. Among his top economic advisers is Stephen Moore from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank last seen laying down many of the policy planks for Ronald Reagan. Sure enough, the policies are pure Reagan: slashing red tape and business taxes, â€œa major tax cutâ€\\x9d on income, a repeal of estate taxes and a hankering for high interest rates and sound money. This sort of tax-cutting will cost trillions â€“ up to $9tn over the next decade, according to some modelling. They will rip a hole through US public finances â€“ especially if Trump brings them in alongside his spending spree on infrastructure. But his promise now is the promise that was made by Reagan, his adviser Arthur Laffer and the rest of the snake-oil salesmen: it will bring in more tax revenue over the long run. None of this will be much help for his blue-collar voters. But then the property billionaire isnâ€™t into sharing out the wealth, encouraging trade unions or paying workers more. It wasnâ€™t so long ago that he claimed wages were â€œtoo highâ€\\x9d â€“ before flip-flopping and tweeting that Americaâ€™s middle classes have had â€œno effective raise in years. BAD.â€\\x9d His latest position is that â€œI would like to see an increase [in the minimum wage] of some magnitude. But Iâ€™d rather leave it to the states.â€\\x9d Gee thanks, Donald! You can see the paradox. Much of Trumpâ€™s base was voting against the great unravelling of Americaâ€™s social contract. They were rebelling against Reaganism and its love for Wall Street over Main Street, its property boom and industrial bust. Yet what theyâ€™re about to get is more Reaganism, from a man whose glory years were the Reagan years. When that doesnâ€™t work out, the new president will retreat further into his anti-immigrant, â€œdecent peopleâ€\\x9d rhetoric. If he need script lines, he can borrow some from the new British government. A revolt isnâ€™t a revolution. The head prefects in our politics and media see disorder and immediately cry insurrection. Thatâ€™s what they did in Britain after the Brexit vote and itâ€™s how theyâ€™ll mark 20 January, 2017, the date of President Trumpâ€™s inauguration. Just as they called those events wrong, so theyâ€™ll call the aftermath wrong. You can overdo the comparisons, but letâ€™s at least agree that Trumpâ€™s America and Brexit Britain share the same common tragedy: a large chunk of the public thatâ€™s had enough of the same-old failed orthodoxy, a technocratic elite that also knows itâ€™s no longer working â€“ and a political class unable to grasp any real alternatives.',\n",
              "  'Teachers and doctors should invoke the spirit of 1919 and strike together The period after the first world war was a volatile time in Britainâ€™s labour market. Journalist Kingsley Martin wrote in 1966: â€œThe only time in my life when revolution in Britain seemed likely was in 1919.â€\\x9d At that time, Britainâ€™s working class was in the ascendancy: it was indignant, organised and willing to take action. Union membership, which numbered 2.6 million in 1910, had more than tripled to nearly 8 million by 1919. Groups taking industrial action between 1917 and 1919 included miners, railway and transport workers, engineers, bakers, cotton spinners and munitions workers. In a move that alarmed the government, the police also decided to go on strike in the summer of 1918, leading the prime minister, David Lloyd George, to sanction any action necessary, â€œhowever graveâ€\\x9d, to quell the mutiny of the â€œ s of Orderâ€\\x9d. By 1920, unions had secured a series of victories for workers, including 40-hour weeks, wage increases, the prevention of pay cuts and better working conditions. In her farewell speech to the NUT conference this week, the general secretary, Christine Blower, raised the possibility of coordinated action between teachers and junior doctors. Of course, such a move couldnâ€™t be realistically compared with 1919 â€“ for one thing, modern trade union laws prevent different unions taking solidarity action together. What Blower is actually proposing is that both unions arrange to hold two separate strikes â€œcoincidentallyâ€\\x9d on the same day. More important though, the contemporary British working class has been significantly enfeebled by global neoliberalism, which has meant atomised workplaces, suffocating trade union legislation, a supine political class, and the notion that capitalism has won the ideological battle (remember that the working class of 1919 had the October revolution to inspire it). A coordinated strike between teachers and doctors in 2016 is a drop in the ocean compared with the unrest that has come before. But 1919 is still instructive because it reminds us that under capitalism, collective action by workers has the ability to fundamentally change society. And it does this by redressing the power balance between workers and their employers. There is a contract all workers and employers enter into: the worker gives his or her skills and labour, and in return the employer gives a salary and decent working conditions. When the employer retracts his or her half of the bargain, the worker must do the same. This retraction is the only tool workers have in order to force employers to honour their commitments. But itâ€™s not just about individual examples of industrial action. The employer-employee relationship is essential to the functioning of a capitalist society as a whole â€“ and workers have the collective ability to reshape the economy way beyond their particular working conditions. Or as Trotsky breathlessly put it: â€œIf carried through to the end, the general strike brings the revolutionary class up against the task of organising a new state power.â€\\x9d Teachers and doctors are now considering tapping into this collective power, not because they want to bring about a Bolshevik revolution but because they have been driven to an extreme act by a government that is utterly intransigent. Jeremy Hunt has already promised to â€œimposeâ€\\x9d a new contract on junior doctors, despite the profession being almost totally opposed to it. Similarly, the government has announced it will make every school in the UK an academy, despite the consistent opposition of the teaching profession. Once an employer (the government in this case) has made its final stance on a dispute clear, workers can choose to accept that or stand up to it. And if they stand up to it, going on strike is the only option they have. Collective strike action between teachers and doctors is not a radical act, but a rational one â€“ given that it is clear that the government has the power to override their objections without it. This is why public opinion cannot be the only factor unions take into consideration when deciding to go on strike. If this action goes ahead, it will cause significant disruption â€“ a fact that will be used to sour the public mood against the strikers. In a parliamentary democracy, public opinion is a form of power â€“ and it is useful for unions to have it on their side. But the dominant issue in a strike is industrial power, and many strikes have been won without the backing of the public (consider Londonâ€™s tube drivers, for example). On the other hand, the government may find itself on the wrong side of public opinion this time: itâ€™s difficult to be a functioning member of society without giving teachers and doctors some degree of trust. Industrial unrest is usually a symptom of a dysfunctional workplace. The wider issue here is the relationship breakdown between public sector workers and the government. Itâ€™s simply unrealistic to blame that on the workers themselves â€“ they donâ€™t have the resources or inclination to spontaneously attack an employer. Would you wake up one morning and pick a fight with your boss for no reason? What weâ€™re left with is the conclusion that this government undervalues and mistreats people working in the sectors that keep us educated, cared for and alive. If teachers and doctors strike together, it will not just be a significant moment in British industrial relations, but a necessary one. And the outcome will affect us all.',\n",
              "  'Ben Carson nominated for housing secretary in Trump administration Donald Trump has nominated former opponent Ben Carson as his secretary of housing and urban development. In a statement from his transition team on Monday, Trump said he was â€œthrilled to nominateâ€\\x9d Carson, saying the retired neurosurgeon had â€œa brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communitiesâ€\\x9d. â€œBen shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a presidency representing all Americans,â€\\x9d he added. Carson responded to the announcement with a brief statement accepting Trumpâ€™s nomination. â€œI am honored and look forward to working hard on behalf of the American people,â€\\x9d he wrote. Carson had previously taken himself out of the running to serve in Trumpâ€™s cabinet amid speculation that the former doctor was being considered to head the Department of Health and Human Services. A Carson spokesperson said he did not feel he had the experience to run a federal agency and did not want to assume a role â€œthat could cripple the presidencyâ€\\x9d. But Carson signalled his thinking had changed in a Facebook post late last month, in which he hinted at a possible position at the federal agency tasked with overseeing Americaâ€™s fair housing laws and urban development policies. â€œAfter serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,â€\\x9d Carson wrote in the post on 23 November. â€œWe have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid.â€\\x9d Republicans praised Carsonâ€™s personal attributes but were relatively muted in response to Trumpâ€™s decision to place an outsider at the helm of one of the nationâ€™s top agencies. â€œWe appreciate Dr Carsonâ€™s willingness to take on such a challenging task at an agency that is in need of reform to better serve all Americans,â€\\x9d Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said in a statement. â€œIâ€™m confident his life-long career of selfless service will be a positive addition to the incoming administration.â€\\x9d Democrats, by contrast, assailed the retired neurosurgeon as wholly unqualified for the role. â€œDr Ben Carson is a disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice to lead a department as complex and consequential as Housing and Urban Development,â€\\x9d said Nancy Pelosi, who was recently re-elected as the Democratsâ€™ leader in the House of Representatives, in a statement. â€œThere is no evidence that Dr Carson brings the necessary credentials to hold a position with such immense responsibilities and impact on families and communities across America.â€\\x9d Charles Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader in the Senate, said he had serious concerns about Carsonâ€™s lack of expertise and experience in the field of housing. â€œSomeone who is as anti-government as him is a strange fit for housing secretary, to say the least,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAs he moves through the confirmation process, Americans deserve to know that their potential HUD secretary is well versed in housing policy and has a vision for federal housing programs that meets the needs of Americans across the country and seeks to provide access to those that we havenâ€™t reached already.â€\\x9d The largest civil rights organization for LGBTQ individuals also sounded alarm over Carsonâ€™s nomination, pointing to his steadfast opposition to gay equality. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) said past comments by Carson referring to homosexuality as â€œa choiceâ€\\x9d and support for conversion therapy raised serious concerns over how HUD would address the housing needs of the LGBTQ community, while citing research showing that LGBTQ youth account for up to 40% of the total unaccompanied homeless youth population. â€œThroughout his failed presidential campaign, Carson ran on a platform on inequality, and, if nominated, his hateful views could have disastrous effects on LGBTQ people,â€\\x9d said HRC president Chad Griffin. â€œAs a community already faced with housing insecurity, we need an ally, not an agitator, who will protect every Americanâ€™s right to a safe place to lie down each night.â€\\x9d Carson and Trump feuded bitterly during the Republican presidential primaries, with Trump at one point characterizing Carson as having a â€œpathological temperâ€\\x9d akin to the illness of a child molester. But Carson endorsed Trump in March, saying the two men had â€œburied the hatchetâ€\\x9d, and went on to be one of the real estate mogulâ€™s most loyal supporters for the duration of the election campaign. Trumpâ€™s decision to tap Carson as the housing and urban development (HUD) secretary followed his announcement nominating the South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, as ambassador to the United Nations, and Elaine Chao as transportation secretary. Haley, Chao and Carson are the first people of color chosen by Trump to serve in his cabinet. This article was amended on 5 December 2016. Due to an editing error, an earlier version omitted that Elaine Chao, who is Taiwanese American, had been nominated as transportation secretary. Chao, Haley and Carson are the three people of color nominated to Trumpâ€™s cabinet.',\n",
              "  \"'Horrible spike' in hate crime linked to Brexit vote, Met police say A â€œhorrible spikeâ€\\x9d in hate crime after Britainâ€™s vote to leave the European Union was at least partly linked to the referendum, Britainâ€™s most senior police officer has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told a hearing at Londonâ€™s City Hall that hate crime was showing signs of decreasing after a sharp rise in June and July, but it had still not returned to pre-referendum levels. Monitoring presented at the hearing by the London mayorâ€™s evidence and insight team showed a 16% increase in hate crime in the 12 months to August. It also showed that in the 38 days after the referendum there were more than 2,300 recorded race-hate offences in London, compared with 1,400 in the 38 days before the vote. Hogan-Howe expressed alarm about the figures. â€œWe saw this horrible spike after Brexit,â€\\x9d he said. He revealed there was a connection between the referendum and many of the incidents and pointed out that many of the victims were eastern Europeans. Hogan-Howe said: â€œWe couldnâ€™t say it was absolutely down to Brexit, although there was obviously a spike after it. Some of them were attributed to it because of what was said at the time. We could attribute that, and eastern Europeans were particularly targeted within the race-hate crime [category]. So there certainly was a spike related to it. â€œWe have fortunately seen it start to come back down, but Iâ€™m not sure we can say yet it is back to previous levels.â€\\x9d He added: â€œThe absolute numbers are low, but we think it is massively under-reported [crime]. Sadly, people donâ€™t tell us about the harassment and the abuse that we know will go on out there.â€\\x9d Hogan-Howe pledged that more specialist officers dedicated to tackling hate crime would be deployed. Sophie Linden, Londonâ€™s deputy mayor for policing, who was hosting the hearing, said she was still getting daily reports about hate crime in the capital. â€œIt is worrying that it does not appear to have gone back down to pre-referendum levels.â€\\x9d Figures from the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council showed a 49% rise in hate crime incidents to 1,863 in the last week in July in England, Wales and Northern Ireland compared with the previous year. A survey by the found that European embassies in Britain have logged dozens of incidents of suspected hate crime and abuse against their citizens since the referendum. The vast majority of incidents involved citizens from eastern European countries, with more attacks against Poles than against all the other nationalities put together. They include the killing of Arkadiusz JÃ³Åºwik in Harlow, in an apparently unprovoked attack that is being treated by police as a possible hate crime. Five 15-year-old boys and one 16-year-old boy, all from Harlow, were arrested on suspicion of murdering JÃ³Åºwik and bailed until 7 October pending further inquiries. A second Polish man survived the attack.\",\n",
              "  'Why Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie is a better fashion satire than Zoolander 2 March 2015 saw the splashy beginning of Zoolander 2â€™s relentless buzz-building campaign as stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson appeared in character at Paris fashion week. It was covered extensively by both film and fashion press, and kicked off an exhaustively well-sustained assault on anyone with an internet connection all the way through to its release in February this year. Given the first filmâ€™s cult following and how surprisingly well it stands up to repeat viewings 15 years later, expectations were high for another quotable combination of well-measured silliness and sharp fashion-industry satire. But it was a washout, a tiresome and aggressively unfunny mis-step, the sort of lazy rehash that makes you question whether you even liked the original. Five months later and we have another couple of fictional fashionistas dusted off and resurrected for those blessed with a good memory. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie brings back Patsy and Edina, originally on the BBC in 1992, and catapults them to the big screen following in the footsteps of The Inbetweeners and, most recently, Dadâ€™s Army. The campaign was far more modest, cheap even, and the buzz was notably less feverish, not helped by the filmâ€™s first press screening taking place just two days before its release. Yet, against all odds, it works. The comic timing of Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley has been curiously underutilised in the years since Ab Fab went off air, and the film, wonderfully short, scrappy and snappy at 91 minutes, gives them free rein to remind us of their skills. Itâ€™s imperfect (the plot is almost an afterthought), but itâ€™s far funnier than it should be, given how unnecessary it all seemed on paper. The pleasure of watching the pair drunkenly embarrass themselves across Europe far outweighs watching Stiller and Wilson uncover new levels of idiocy in a glossier transatlantic trip. Both films posit their characters as relics, struggling to keep up with an industry changed irrevocably by social media and populated with those far younger and sharper. But Patsy and Edina were always in this mode, obsessed with remaining current, aware of their sell-by date and failing, miserably, to succeed in the fashion world. Alternately, Derek and Hansel were, bizarrely and comically, at the top of their game in the first film, only to be brought back to earth in the sequel. When your film receives a green light on the basis of fan service, youâ€™d be wise to make sure your most loyal fans are well-served. By changing the dynamic, we lost the joke of seeing two middle-aged, above-average-looking men touted as gorgeous supermodels and instead in the sequel, they ended up playing fortysomething dads failing to comprehend selfie culture. Ab Fab doesnâ€™t deviate from its original setup, it merely exaggerates it, an understandable decision given the increased gap between the leads and the youthful culture they hope to dominate. Thereâ€™s also a confidence in the characters in Ab Fab thanks to a wealth of material, 39 episodes in fact, that have proved their longevity and also the actorsâ€™ skill at playing them. Zoolander 2 proved that Derek and Hansel have less mileage, and despite both films having largely nonsensical and haphazard plots, only Patsy and Edina manage to rise above. The poor box office of Stillerâ€™s sequel was a sign that the fandom wasnâ€™t as strong as Paramount had anticipated. On the same budget of $50m, similarly belated comedy follow-up Anchorman 2 managed to make almost four times that, while Zoolander 2 just about broke even. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie wonâ€™t play to huge numbers abroad, but surprisingly strong reviews and a fanbase thatâ€™s stuck around since the early 90s might make it a modest domestic success. By never pretending to be in style, Patsy and Edina have remained more fashionable than Derek and Hansel could have ever dreamed of.',\n",

              "  'Drinking too much water when ill can be harmful, finds study The common advice to drink plenty of water when ill is based on scant evidence and can actively harm chances of recovery, doctors have warned. Medics at Kingâ€™s College hospital NHS foundation trust, in London, raised the alarm after they treated a patient with hyponatremia â€“ abnormally low sodium â€“ from drinking too much water to help with a recurring urinary tract infection. In the case highlighted, a 59-year-old woman consumed several litres of water based on medical advice she recalled from previous similar episodes to â€œflush out her systemâ€\\x9d. She became progressively shaky, muddled, vomited several times and had significant speech difficulties. Dr Maryann Noronha, the co-author of the study published in BMJ Case Reports on Thursday, said: â€œWhen people are ill they donâ€™t tend to drink very much water because itâ€™s the last thing they want to do and you can become dehydrated very quickly. â€œTo counteract that risk, doctors have said â€˜Make sure you drink lots of water.â€™ That has perpetrated the myth that you must drink gallons of water. Most people donâ€™t do that but in this case they did it to the letter.â€\\x9d Tests revealed her high intake of water had resulted in dangerously low sodium levels â€“ 123 mmol/L â€“ classifying it as a medical emergency. A mortality rate of almost 30% has been reported for patients with sodium levels of less than 125 mmol/L. Doctors restricted her fluid intake to 1 litre over the next 24 hours. By the following morning her blood tests were normal and she was discharged later that day. In a previous case a woman with gastroenteritis developed hyponatremia and died from drinking excessive amounts of water. Fatal water intoxication has also been reported in people engaged in endurance exercise and using the drug MDMA (ecstasy), when they have sweated heavily and overcompensated with fluids. The authors stress that it is rare to develop water intoxication with normal renal function but warn that some illnesses drive up levels of antidiuretic hormones, which reduce normal excretion of water. â€œDoctors should try to be more specific in their advice,â€\\x9d said Noronha. â€œI say to people, while they are ill they should at least consume their normal fluid intake and up to half again [ie, up to 150%]. If you drink three litres, you shouldnâ€™t drink six litres when you are ill.â€\\x9d Public Health England recommends people should drink six to eight glasses of fluid a day, including water, lower fat milk and sugar-free drinks including tea and coffee. Noronha said the amount needed by different people varies, but the main message is not to change your consumption too greatly when you are ill. â€œIf you are someone who doesnâ€™t drink much water and then suddenly fill your body with masses thatâ€™s going to have a very big effect,â€\\x9d she said. She hopes the paper might prompt research in the area so that objective guidance can be drawn up. Dr Imran Rafi, the chair of clinical innovation and research at the Royal College of GPs, said: â€œDrinking enough water is important in keeping healthy, both physically and mentally, and patients should keep their fluids up when unwell, particularly in conditions that can cause dehydration. â€œThere is no steadfast recommendation as to how much water people should drink in order to stay healthy, but the key thing is to keep hydrated â€“ and passing clear urine is a good indication of this. â€œThis case report highlights that excessive water intake can have important consequences for patients, and this is something that healthcare professionals, and patients, should be mindful of.â€\\x9d What is the advice? Public Health England recommends drinking six to eight glasses of fluid a day, including but not limited to water. There is no official guidance as to how much to drink when ill, but Noronha advises no more than 1.5 times the amount you would usually drink. Noronha says water is generally fine but recommends a rehydrations sachet if suffering from gastroenteritis.',\n",
              "  'Juan Mataâ€™s mastery may push Wayne Rooney to Manchester United margins Wayne Rooney may now be entering the career phase when he is used only in certain games for Manchester United. This was the unescapable conclusion drawn from JosÃ© Mourinhoâ€™s decision to drop him to the bench and the 4-1 rout of Leicester City at Old Trafford that followed. The victory on Saturday was significant because it reversed the rot of two successive Premier League defeats and to do so Mourinho found the ruthless streak that has been a driving part of his gilded success at Porto, Chelsea (in both spells), Internazionale and Real Madrid. After the EFL Cup win at Northampton Town ended the run of three defeats on the bounce in all competitions â€“ the other came in the Europa League â€“ Mourinho examined what was needed to defeat the champions and decided his captain was surplus to requirements. Instead Zlatan Ibrahimovic retained his place at centre-forward, and Mourinho fielded the pace of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard out wide. The selection of Juan Mata at No10 was of most significance. For the first time since the Spaniard arrived in January 2014 (from Mourinhoâ€™s Chelsea) Mata was selected in his favoured position ahead of Rooney, who had to gaze on as United coasted into the break 4-0 ahead. A 20-minute burst that featured goals from Chris Smalling, Mata, Paul Pogba (a maiden United strike) and Rashford â€“ answered only by Demarai Grayâ€™s second-half shot â€“ finished the contest and may have ended Rooneyâ€™s days as a certain starter. The Liverpudlian has been written off before â€“ doing so is a quasi-national pastime â€“ but Mourinhoâ€™s post-game comments may come to be viewed as the death knell for his alpha-male status in the XI. â€œWe thought the solution for us was to play with the two fast kids and with Mata in a position where he could interact,â€\\x9d the Portuguese said. The subtext here is that Mourinho decided Rooney was the inferior option to Mata to link with Lingard and Rashford. The reason is the sideâ€™s previous poor form in which Rooneyâ€™s apparent inability to stop wandering out of position clogged Unitedâ€™s flow. Yet Mourinho stressed that Rooney was still his man (as the manager has to) and Smalling believes his England colleague will soon be back in the side. â€œI think heâ€™s a very experienced guy and heâ€™s played that many games that itâ€™ll only be a matter of time before heâ€™s back in there and firing again because heâ€™s quality,â€\\x9d the defender said. Mourinho talked of how Rooney was the captain not only on the field but away from it with regard to representing the club and helping out team-mates. Smalling concurred. Asked if Rooney had been down about being dropped, he said: â€œNo. He was the same as [ever] before the game when weâ€™re all getting ready. He is often one of the most vocal and he was the same. â€œRegardless of whatever the situation is, whatever game, whether he is on the bench or playing or whatever, he is always that same type of character and thatâ€™s why he is Englandâ€™s main man and our main man.â€\\x9d But for how much longer? Unitedâ€™s next outing is the visit of Ukraineâ€™s Zarya Lugansk on Thursday evening for the second Europa League group match. Rooney may well be recalled for a game that must be won following the defeat at Feyenoord in the opener. This, though, may establish a pattern of the forward being deployed sparingly by Mourinho and in contests against lesser opponents. If Rooney was discarded for the challenge of Leicester what about when, say, United travel to Liverpool (the next league game but one) or are at Chelsea the following weekend? The victory against Leicester has given Mourinho a mandate â€“ for the foreseeable future, at least â€“ to leave out Rooney when he wishes. A reverse to Claudio Ranieriâ€™s side or even a less emphatic win may have provoked the question of whether Rooney is a convenient scapegoat. Not now. For the time being the man with 246 United goals (three behind Sir Bobby Charltonâ€™s record) may be reduced to a peripheral role. Smalling said Rooney had been vocal in the dressing room before the match despite starting on the bench. â€œHe had the same method,â€\\x9d the 26-year-old said. â€œEven when thereâ€™s games â€“ obviously we play League Cup and he [Mourinho] changes the whole team, heâ€™s still the same, in the changing room talking. Thatâ€™s something that will never change with Wayne.â€\\x9d The defender revealed what Mourinhoâ€™s message was beforehand. â€œHe really wanted to get that factor over of enjoyment and enjoying it because he thereâ€™s 70-odd thousand people in the stands who would want to be in our shoes and his shoes,â€\\x9d he said. â€œItâ€™s just a case of realising how lucky we are. And you can see that everyone did enjoy it so that message really did get across.â€\\x9d How much personal satisfaction Rooney drew from not being a factor in the victory is moot. He may not have been hurdling the moon to witness the side function so well without him. Afterwards Rooney, who came on for Rashford with seven minutes remaining, had a kickabout with his children on the pitch. The question is how soon he will again be mixing it regularly with the big boys.',\n",
              "  'PPI payouts knock down Lloyds profits but boost British shoppers It is difficult to remember a year when the British consumer was forced to cope without the proceeds from a mis-selling scandal. The payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal has proved to be the most lucrative, punishing banks with fines of Â£22.5bn and administrative costs of another Â£8-9bn for attaching the expensive insurance cover to credit cards and loans without consumersâ€™ knowledge. Lloyds Banking Group has just added another Â£4bn to the total cost after it said another tranche of cash would be needed to satisfy regulators. According to the Financial Conduct Authority, the total payout in each year since 2011 averages Â£4.5bn. About 12 million people have secured compensation, with an average payout of Â£1,875. In 2012 the total reached Â£6.3bn, which is the equivalent to a 1.5p cut in the standard rate of tax. At the time, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the refunds could push GDP growth 0.1-0.2% higher. A survey by the money-saving website VoucherCodesPro in 2014 examined more closely what happened to the money. It found that most people rushed out and bought a holiday. Next on the list was a new car, followed by buying home appliances such as fridge freezers, followed by paying bills. The survey also found that it only took two and a half weeks on average to spend the money from a settled PPI claim. Only 12% of people put any of the windfall into a savings account. Looking back at the trends of recent years, it is noticeable that the sales figures for holidays and cars have soared and provided the backbone for GDP growth. But the payouts are only one element, albeit the largest, of the PPI boost to the economy. The regulator and the banks have spent around Â£4bn processing claims and the private claims companies, infamous for urging bank customers to seek compensation with pestering phone calls, have grabbed an estimated Â£5bn for themselves. Such was the boom in jobs that, in 2014, it registered in the official labour market statistics as one of the fastest growing areas of employment. These workers will have spent their wages and paid tax, increasing GDP further. Maybe that is why George Osborne is keen to offer Lloyds shares owned by the government at a discount. He can see the PPI effect waning and he recognises the need for a multi-billion-pound boost to the economy â€“ not from the exchequer, which is cutting back on spending, but by selling a taxpayer-owned asset and calling it a gift. It was the same in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcherâ€™s privatisations started the cascade of funds. In the 1990s, there was the demutualisation of building societies and countless insurers. When the Halifax turned itself into a PLC in 1997, 7.5 million customers received shares worth Â£1,500 and the handout was worth 2p off the standard rate of income tax. One estimate found that 12% of recipients saved the money, but everyone else spent it. Osborne will hope he can sell the Lloyds shares and get a good price for them, in order to boost incomes and offset the worst of his austerity measures.',\n",
              "  'Sunderland suffer with Virgil van Dijk grabbing Southampton a point Following an unseemly few days for Sunderland off the pitch, it was back to the football and time for the clubâ€™s players to provide some on-field respite. They did so up to a point, weathering a literal and metaphorical storm before taking a late lead courtesy of a Jermain Defoe strike shortly after Southampton had been reduced to 10 men. Unable to hang on, they let Virgil van Dijk rescue a point for his side three minutes into added time. This was two points dropped rather than one gained for Sunderland, but at a ground where they suffered the humiliation of losing 8-0 last season, it was revenge of sorts and defeats elsewhere for fellow relegation battlers Newcastle United and Norwich City made it a little sweeter. Or did they? â€œIt was a kick in the teeth,â€\\x9d said Sam Allardyce. â€œI canâ€™t even begin to tell you how dejected we are and how much more difficult weâ€™ve made our job to stay in the Premier League.â€\\x9d Asked if he could see any positives from the point gained, his answer was emphatic. â€œNo,â€\\x9d he sighed wistfully. â€œI was looking forward to celebrating my first clean sheet on Motherâ€™s Day, but now I think Iâ€™ll be crying into my glass of wine and I hope I donâ€™t take this out on my grandkids.â€\\x9d In an opening half hour memorable mainly for the bitterness of the south coast cold, neither side created much to warm the cockles. After 22 minutes Fabio Borini, in at the expense of Defoe, escaped down the right only for his low, angled drive to be blocked by an excellent covering tackle from Van Djik. Soon after, Southampton ought to have gone ahead, only to be foiled by an excellent Vito Mannone save after Dusan Tadic had reacted quickly to power a Graziano PellÃ¨ knockdown goalwards. Just after the half hour, Mannoneâ€™s opposite number was called into something resembling urgent action. With a Wahbi Khazri free-kick from wide threatening to drift in to the top left-hand corner, a furiously back-pedalling Fraser Forster did well to palm the goal-bound effort on to his crossbar. In splendid isolation out on the wing, Khazri clasped his head with both hands in sheer frustration. The cold of the first half was augmented by torrential rain early in the second, although the deluge failed to dampen the enthusiasm of a vocal visiting support. As the downpour eased off, Jack Rodwell had them out of their seats but his low effort failed to trouble Forster unduly. Rising to the spirit of tit-for-tat in which much of the game was played, Oriol Romeu promptly sent the ball fizzing inches over from 20-yards. As the game entered its final 20 minutes, Sunderland sat deep on the back foot but it was Southamptonâ€™s JosÃ© Fonte who was forced into an act of desperation. The Portuguese earned a straight red card for grappling Borini as he chased a through ball to the edge of the penalty area. From the subsequent free-kick, Patrick van Aanholt brought a very smart stop from Forster. Enter Defoe. Lamine KonÃ© pounced on a knockdown from Jan Kirchhoff in the penalty area, evaded a tackle and squared for the substitute to prod home from seven yards and prompt scenes of unbridled jubilation in the away end. They were short-lived, however: Southampton huffed and puffed relentlessly before eventually blowing the Sunderland house down when the excellent Van Dijk found himself unmarked on the end of a cross into the Sunderland penalty area and fired home deep in injury time. â€œItâ€™s strange that we play our best football in the last five or six minutes,â€\\x9d said Ronald Koeman. â€œFrom the beginning we need better performances football wise but we showed great character after going 1-0 down and Iâ€™m very pleased with that.â€\\x9d Slumped in a chair at his post-match press conference, his opposite number could scarcely have sounded more glum.',\n",

She is never in a rush, and her third album benefits enormously from a sense of stillness and serenity. Producer Aaron Dessner (from the National) has framed the Dublin-born singerâ€™s crystal vocals in an understated, often hushed atmosphere. Hanniganâ€™s voice is sometimes unadorned, or with minimal (often just piano) backing; even singing ghostly harmonies with itself. Watery themes predominate, from the lovely, adorational Undertowâ€™s offer to â€œswim in your current, flow on every word you sayâ€\\x9d to the disarmingly beautiful Oraâ€™s haunting invitation to join her at â€œhomeâ€\\x9d in the vast blue waters.

              "  'EU states set to veto any Brexit deal threatening free movement Four central European countries are prepared to veto any Brexit deal agreed between the UK and the European Union that restricts their citizensâ€™ rights to live and work in Britain, the prime minister of Slovakia has said. In a stark reminder of the challenge Britain faces at the negotiating table, Robert Fico said Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia â€“ known as the Visegrad, or V4, group â€“ would not hesitate to block any future trade accord that threatened the key EU principle of free movement of workers. â€œThe V4 countries will be uncompromising,â€\\x9d Fico said on Saturday, a day after EU leaders met informally in Bratislava, without Britain, to try to chart a roadmap for the blocâ€™s future after the shock of the Brexit vote. â€œUnless we feel a guarantee that these people [living and working in Britain] are equal, we will veto any agreement between the EU and Britain,â€\\x9d Fico told Reuters. â€œI think Britain knows this is an issue for us where thereâ€™s no room for compromise.â€\\x9d London has not yet revealed what kind of trade agreement it wants with the European Union, but has said its priority is to control EU immigration while maximising opportunities for trade. The European commission and parliament, in addition to the 27 remaining member states who must all ratify a future Brexit trade deal, have repeatedly made clear that enhanced access to the single market will not be on offer unless Britain accepts free movement. Brexit was not formally discussed at Fridayâ€™s meeting, but the commissionâ€™s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, reiterated the blocâ€™s stance at a press conference, saying he could not see â€œany possibility of compromisingâ€\\x9d on the question. Fico also stressed after the summit that he and other central European governments would not allow their nationals to become â€œsecond-class citizensâ€\\x9d. He said on Saturday that fierce Visegrad opposition to mandatory quotas for refugees had persuaded the EU to shift its approach to the migrant crisis. The bloc will now pursue a new principle of â€œflexible solidarityâ€\\x9d, he said, although it is not yet clear what that might mean in practice. Fico said the V4 countries would show the same determination in defending their common interest in protecting their citizensâ€™ rights to work in Britain, reiterating that there could be no â€œcherry-pickingâ€\\x9d in upcoming Brexit negotiations and that EU freedoms must be respected. Britain has said it will not start the formal two-year talks to leave the EU this year because it needs time to consider its position, but could do so next year. In principle the article 50 exit deal, which the EU will approve by qualified majority voting, must be concluded before the new trade deal â€“ which will require unanimity â€“ can be addressed. On Friday the European council president, Donald Tusk, said in Bratislava that he believed following a meeting with the prime minister, Theresa May, that article 50 would probably be invoked in January or February 2017. However, a Downing Street source said on Saturday that the prime minister did not specifically mention January or February at the meeting and that Tuskâ€™s comments were an â€œinterpretationâ€\\x9d of their conversation. Fico said the Visegrad group would continue to adopt and defend common positions, which he described as being sometimes more â€œpragmaticâ€\\x9d than other EU nations owing to the four statesâ€™ history since the second world war and the collapse of the communist bloc. He said he wanted migration issues to be more clearly addressed in the blocâ€™s future roadmap, but was happy that border security was more of a priority and that discussion was now underway on flexible solidarity to allow countries to offer what they feel they can to help resolve the migrant crisis.',\n",
              "  'Like Ed Balls, Jeremy Corbyn is struggling to impress the judges When polling stations closed at 10pm on the night of 7 May 2015, the bookies would have given generous odds on Ed Balls doing the waltz on Strictly Come Dancing and Jeremy Corbyn leading the Labour party less than 18 months later. Had things turned out a little differently, Balls would now be running the Treasury and Corbyn would have remained a backbench MP. Ed Miliband would have been at the head of a coalition government and there would have been no EU referendum. In the intervening period, Corbyn has won not one but two leadership contests, both by thumping majorities. His opponents in the party have been routed and he now has the job of getting Labour ready to fight the next election. That will be no easy task. Three months ago, the notion that the Conservative party would hold a double-digit opinion poll lead over the Labour party looked remote. David Cameron had just resigned after calling and losing the Brexit referendum and there were fears of a summer of financial and political chaos while the Tories chose a new prime minister. Labour had its problems but they appeared to be minor by comparison. The mood has now changed. Theresa May is enjoying a honeymoon period and political pundits assume that she will trounce Corbyn whenever she chooses to go to the country, whether that is at a snap election next spring or if the current parliament is allowed to run its full five-year course. The conventional wisdom is that Britain is facing another prolonged period of uninterrupted Conservative rule. But honeymoons - as Gordon Brown can testify - come to an end. Labourâ€™s last prime minister looked the part and had an assured start when he took over from Tony Blair in the summer of 2007. Then the financial crisis broke, there were queues outside Northern Rock branches and it was never the same again. Mayâ€™s honeymoon could turn out to be similarly brief. While the risk of an immediate recession has receded, it is possible that the government will make a hash of the Brexit negotiations when they eventually start. Before that, though, there is the possibility that the supposed cure for the last recession unwittingly creates the conditions for another painful downturn. This is what is happening. Interest rates are low everywhere and have been for years. The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are still upping the amount of stimulus they are providing, even though it is almost a decade since the sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted in the summer of 2007. The only major central bank that is even thinking about tightening policy is the US Federal Reserve. The Fed took the first tentative step towards the â€œnormalisationâ€\\x9d of interest rates (around 5% was the pre-crisis norm) last December and sent out signals that the cost of borrowing would be pushed up several times during 2016. Since then, though, the Fed has sat tight even though unemployment is low and consumer spending is strong. With negligible wage pressure and last yearâ€™s fall in the cost of energy holding inflation down, the Fed has said it wants to see further evidence that the economy is strengthening before moving again. Wall Street has taken that as a strong hint to be prepared for a December rate rise although, on past form, it wonâ€™t take much for the Fed to again decide to leave policy unchanged. In theory, the ability to borrow for the long term at ultra-low rates should be providing an incentive for US businesses to invest. That, though, is not what is happening. Rather than invest, corporations are borrowing money in order to buy back their own shares. This makes sense because, as Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research has pointed out, the cost of money is below the yield on stocks. But it also means the Fed has created the perfect conditions for a massive stock market bubble, which will pop the moment that interest rates start to rise. The US, courtesy of the dearth of investment, has weak productivity and inflation will start to pick up once growth accelerates to much more than 2%. The fear of the majority of the Fedâ€™s policymakers is that an over-hasty move would send share prices sharply lower, leading to slower growth, higher unemployment and an undershoot of its inflation target. But delay means that the stock market bubble continues to inflate and that the bust â€“ when it comes â€“ will be even more severe. It is easy enough to envisage circumstances in which a panic on Wall Street leads to the second global recession in a decade. What would this mean for UK politics? Labour had two problems during the 2007-09 crash. The first was that it was in power when the banks nearly went bust. The second was that it was ill-prepared ideologically to challenge the basis upon which the global economy had been run for the previous 30 years. New Labour had bought into the idea that there was precious little governments could, or even should, do to tame the power of global finance. Clearly, Corbyn doesnâ€™t have the first of these problems. If there is another financial crisis, it is going to happen on Mayâ€™s watch. The more interesting question is whether Labour could respond to a fresh crisis with an economic programme that is intellectually coherent and politically attractive. This is a tall order. Labour does not tend to win power when times are tough; rather it wins during periods when the mood is optimistic and when the economy is strong, as in 1964 and 1997. In 1945, it was impossible to portray Labourâ€™s economic platform as dangerously radical, since state control of key industries had been necessary to win the war. The UK has the same economic weakness as the US: private investment has been too low even with interest rates at record lows. Corbynâ€™s answer is higher public spending channeled through a national investment bank. There is nothing wrong with this. Indeed, it makes a lot of sense to remedy the UKâ€™s infrastructure deficiencies when borrowing is so cheap. Likewise, an idea that Corbyn floated in the 2015 leadership race - Peopleâ€™s quantitative easing - would provide a useful policy weapon in the event of another severe financial crisis. There is little scope for central banks to cut interest rates further and the current QE programmes have encouraged speculation rather than investment. Peopleâ€™s QE is a form of helicopter money: public investment financed by money creation by the Bank of England. But Labour has done little to turn higher borrowing or Peopleâ€™s QE into mainstream ideas and is failing to counter the perception that it knows more about spending money than creating wealth. In that respect, Corbyn and Balls are alike: both are struggling to impress the judges.',\n",
              "  \"I went to a Trump rally in my hijab. His supporters aren't just racist caricatures After Rose Hamidâ€™s horrifying experience at Trumpâ€™s rally on Friday in South Carolina, many people might wonder how I survived a Trump rally wearing a bright-orange headscarf while holding a giant Qurâ€™an â€“ or why I went at all. I went because I firmly believe that Hamid was on the right path: it is important for people to stand up peacefully for the right things, even if we are confronted with physical and verbal intimidation. It is important to give people that may not have ever met or interacted with a Muslim an opportunity to meet her and learn about Islam from someone that actually practices it. And it is important, at a time when people like me too often face discrimination and hatred living our daily lives, to be polite, and yet be visible and present when we are the subject of political speeches. And nothing bad happened to me at the rally: there were some hard stares and dirty looks, but no outright rude behavior. I spoke to several lovely people and had the type of informative and substantive discourse that one should expect at a political event. It was good to see that the bullies and thugs who have been fixtures at several other Trump rallies had taken the day off; maybe they were just too shocked to say anything directly to me. Before this weekend, Iâ€™d never staged any sort of civil disobedience act; before this weekend, I had been perfectly content to never attend a Trump rally. But Hamid inspired me to make myself visible to the kind of people the media suggests hate me, and to make myself available for their edification. So I looked up Trumpâ€™s speaking schedule, discovered that he was speaking on Sunday in Reno, Nevada (a four-hour drive from me), downloaded a ticket and hopped into my car. I drove overnight through a blizzard and fog, but I arrived safely and I was able to get to the venue about 15 minutes after the doors opened; already, the line snaked around the building. Many people in line did double-takes, or their heads snapped around to gawk at me (almost to the point where I thought they would snap off), but I was permitted to stand in line and wait as about a half dozen vendors peddled a motley array of Trump merchandise around us. The most provocative act that I encountered occurred towards the beginning of my two-hour wait: a vendor noticed me and immediately came down to my section of the line where he loudly announced that he was selling â€œBomb The Hell Out Of Isisâ€\\x9d T-shirts (apparently, the desire to kill people is considered trendy fashion at a Trump rally). He looked directly at me to see how I would react; I looked back at him, shook my head, smiled and read my Qurâ€™an as I patiently waited for someone to engage me in civil conversation. I attended Sundayâ€™s rally with the intention to educate myself and, hopefully, to educate others. I didnâ€™t go to shout at Trumpâ€™s supporters, no matter how passionately I feel about some of their claims. And it was interesting to hear Trump and his supportersâ€™ viewpoints for more than just the few seconds offered by most soundbites. His supporters are people, not caricatures. They feel marginalized economically, politically, and socially; they see a world different from the one they think should exist. Many non-Trump supporters are also concerned about the current economic and political state of our planet and its implications for a stabile future for our children. What differentiates me from many of the Trump supporters I met this weekend is that their concerns for our future have led to an overwhelming need to see all of our problems as someone elseâ€™s fault. To Trump and his supporters, Asian countries have â€œdumpedâ€\\x9d their goods in America and almost bankrupted our country by causing our trade deficit; Mexico wonâ€™t keep â€œillegalsâ€\\x9d (who are the â€œsourceâ€\\x9d for Americansâ€™ drugs) on their side of the border; and, of course, Muslims have â€œalwaysâ€\\x9d been fighting us, and come from countries populated by ingrates who are unwilling to pay for the wars that we started on â€œtheirâ€\\x9d behalf. But solving our trade deficit isnâ€™t as simple as ending the supply of cheap Asian goods that Americans so happily consume. Mexico is not going to pay us to build us a wall. The rest of the world will not stand by and let the US seize Iraqâ€™s oilfields (and thus control a significant supply of the worldâ€™s oil). Trumpâ€™s supporters, though, love him for his outrageous suggestions; it provides them with a sense of empowerment and control. And his lack of specificity allows each person to hear what they want to hear. The increasing popularity of these types of events reflects the fact that Trump supporters â€“ the people who used to be Tea Partiers, who supported Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin or any one of a number of politicians whoâ€™ve used this rhetoric before Trump â€“ arenâ€™t going to go away. Whether Trump wins or loses, his supporters will still be out there, longing for another leader to â€œmake America great againâ€\\x9d. People like me cannot keep thinking and hoping that Trump supporters will all go away eventually. We cannot continue to believe that they represent a fringe group of people and that their candidates can never be elected to a major role in government. We need to see them, and listen to them, and disagree respectfully. We need to, as Americans, begin talking to and not at one another. I understood that I was a guest at their rally, and that I had a duty to them to be a good guest; in return, I felt like they were good hosts. And whether they engaged me directly or not, many of them had to acknowledge the presence of someone who disagreed with them, but who did not fit their stereotypes by being disagreeable. Yes, what I did could have been dangerous: the Trump campaign, like many movements, has been dogged by its share of mischief makers. The thugs and bullies who have hurt other dissenters are a small, but very real, part of the ultra-nationalism that vague, implausible rhetoric like Trumpâ€™s attracts. But it was worth the risk to me to show them that their insecurities about Muslims were unfounded. It was worth it to humanize Muslims for them. And it was worth it, to me, to recognize their humanity, too.\",\n",

Associated British Foods had previously warned that it expected a â€œmarginal declineâ€\\x9d in earnings per share for the financial year, which ends in August. However, following the result of the EU referendum, the company said overseas profits in the final quarter would be better than expected once translated into sterling. The better-than-expected news on profits came as Primark revealed its third consecutive quarter of sales falls at established stores, for the three months to 18 June. ABF said total sales at its fashion chain had risen by 7% in the 40 weeks to 18 June after it opened 11 new stores in the last three months of the period. However, underlying sales in the last quarter were hit by â€œunpredictable weather patternsâ€\\x9d, particularly the cold weather in April followed by a return to more seasonal weather in May. John Bason, ABFâ€™s finance director, said the retailerâ€™s sales performance had been affected across Europe by the weather, although it had enjoyed strong growth in Ireland amid an economic recovery in its home market. The company also warned that Primarkâ€™s UK profit margins would suffer as a result of the falling value of the pound against the dollar and the euro. However, this will be offset by a favourable boost to margins at the groupâ€™s sugar business and also in translating profits earned outside the UK, which last year made up 50% of the total. Bason said it was too early to tell if there would be a post-Brexit sales dip in the UK, but he added: â€œIâ€™ve seen Primark do well in good economic times and more challenged economic times.â€\\x9d He said there would be cost pressures on all clothing retailers next year in the light of the devaluation of the pound, but that it was not clear if this would feed through into price rises for shoppers. Bason said Primarkâ€™s prices would be partly driven by the actions of its competitors. â€œWe are never going to be a leader on price increases,â€\\x9d he said. Plans to expand Primark remain unchanged in the light of the UKâ€™s vote to leave the EU. The chain expects to open 300,000 sq ft more trading space by August, including two more stores in the US, at Willow Grove in gGreater Philadelphia, and Freehold Raceway in New Jersey. It will also double the size of its Creteil store in Paris. The company said the decision to leave the EU had created uncertainty in the business environment and financial markets, but added: â€œWe have a strong balance sheet and we remain optimistic for the groupâ€™s continued growth.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Orson Welles fans who donated to have final film finished want their money back A campaign to restore Orson Wellesâ€™ final film has been plunged into delay and acrimony following reports that the late Hollywood legendâ€™s long-term partner is refusing to give up the negatives. Donors to the crowdfunding campaign to restore The Other Side of the Wind have begun to ask for their money back, according to the New York Post. A total of $406,605 (Â£288,577) was raised towards completing the movie, which was shot by Welles between 1970 and 1976 but remained unfinished upon his death in 1985. Among the campaignâ€™s high-profile backers are JJ Abrams, Clint Eastwood, Steven Soderbergh, Wes Anderson and Sofia Coppola. The legendary lost movie was originally due to be completed in time for the Citizen Kane directorâ€™s 100th birthday on 6 May 2015, with Peter Bogdanovich overseeing the new edit. But Bogdanovich, who also features in the film, last week told Franceâ€™s Le Monde that he did not know when the work would be completed. â€œI am supposed to supervise the editing of the film,â€\\x9d said the director, who was asked by Welles to finish it in the event of his death. â€œI keep being told â€˜10 days, maybe two weeks, we should have it all wrapped upâ€™. I have been hearing that for a long time, but it is possible that one day I will be surprised and they will really have everything wrapped up and we can go to work.â€\\x9d The New York Post cites â€œunconfirmed reportsâ€\\x9d that the negatives for The Other Side of the Wind are still being held by Croatian actor Oja Kodar, who was Wellesâ€™ companion from the early 1960s until his death (though the film-maker did not leave his third wife Paola Mori, whom he married in 1955). Kodar, 75, told the New York Times two years ago that she was ready to sign the contract to finally bring the film to the big screen. She also appears in The Other Side of the Wind, a self-reflexive drama starring John Huston as an obsessive veteran film-maker struggling to complete his final movie despite the collapse of the Hollywood studio system and the rise of a new wave of younger directors. Other cast members include Bob Random, Susan Strasberg, Joseph McBride, Lilli Palmer and a young Dennis Hopper. The crowdfunding campaign was launched on Indiegogo after efforts to secure financing fell through. Some donors have now expressed anger that The Other Side of the Wind remains unfinished, and that they have not been updated on progress by campaign organisers. Donor JÃ©rÃ´me Stavroguine on the Indiegogo campaign page said: â€œMore than $400,000 disappeared with the promises of finishing a masterpiece. What can we do in order to get a refund and report this to Indiegogo?â€\\x9d A spokesperson for Indiegogo told the New York Post that it had only received five requests for a refund, and had referred donors to the campaignâ€™s organisers. Fan site Wellesnet reports that Netflix is now negotiating to fund the filmâ€™s completion, having made a $5m offer that also includes cash for a making-of documentary. However, negotiations over remuneration for the holder of the rights appear to be ongoing. Kodarâ€™s nephew Sasha Welles, who has been negotiating on behalf of his aunt, told Wellesnet: â€œFor decades we have been optimistic, otherwise we wouldnâ€™t be trying for so long to get this film released. How optimistic should we be about this particular deal? Hard to tell. â€œAll in all, I am not so optimistic, since they keep on chiseling away from our old agreement. Every time I give in to something they want, they come up with something else. This keeps going on and on and I donâ€™t know where the end is.â€\\x9d',\n",
              "  'Meilyr Jones: â€˜Rome is a place of faith and blood and lustâ€™ Meilyr Jones stands on a street corner not far from Pigneto, wearing gold trainers and a long belted overcoat, his face lit up by the day. It has been, he explains, quite an experience: shooting a video for his next single, watching the sun rise, kissing a stranger and riding shotgun on a Vespa around the backroads of Rome. He leads me through the evening streets, warm with early spring, and is seemingly carried by a kind of buoyancy: talking about the sea, poetry, his childhood in Aberystwyth, his flatshare in London, heading down quiet roads, around corners, doubling back, until we find the bar he has been hunting: a narrow corridor where the wine comes served in plastic cups and the stereo plays opera. At the next table a man is giving a guitar lesson while a small boy plays hide and seek beneath the chairs. Rome is where, three years ago, Jones felt his life begin to change. For eight years and three albums he had fronted the band Race Horses. When they split in January 2013, he found himself cut adrift, 26 years old, questioning the direction of his life and his relationship with music. â€œIt was a messy break and I felt that Iâ€™d lost friends,â€\\x9d he says. â€œI felt Iâ€™d developed a fear of committing to anything. I didnâ€™t feel at all ready to think of myself as a solo musician. I just felt like being normal.â€\\x9d He began investing his time into other artforms: he was dating a sculptor at the time, and his brother gave him a book on sculpture written by the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder. He read Byron and Berliozâ€™s memoirs and Goetheâ€™s Italian Journey. â€œAll these signs were leading me to Rome,â€\\x9d he recalls. â€œAnd I had an intuition that I should go there, that something good and magical might happen if I just looked the other way a little bit and let things happen.â€\\x9d Jones tries to explain the excitement of that time. â€œI started to feel a new life force,â€\\x9d he says. â€œIt didnâ€™t feel like an academic pursuit, it just felt like how it did when I discovered the Beatles for the first time.â€\\x9d He was weary, he adds, of a world that was â€œtoo knowing, and too nicheâ€\\x9d, of the â€œcool, affluent-sounding musicâ€\\x9d that seemed all-pervading. By contrast, he says, â€œ[classical] sculpture and Renaissance music felt like a really living thing. I was enjoying Byron and Don Juan in a really vivid way. It didnâ€™t feel exaggerated or put on â€“ Byron and Keats were what felt real to me. And a love of nature, and my serious feelings of love.â€\\x9d Speaking with Jones is much like this: a tumble of enthusiasms that can encompass Bel Canto and Letâ€™s Wrestle in a single breath. In seemingly one conversational strand heâ€™ll tell you of his love for childrenâ€™s literature (his father was a childrenâ€™s book editor), Fellini and the plastic floral arrangements you often find in Italian churches. Itâ€™s a quality his album 2013 captures, too: Scottish choirs lie down beside karaoke bars, Japanese buskers, orchestras, bursts of David Bowieâ€™s Rebel Rebel. â€œThat feels like modern life to me,â€\\x9d he says by way of explanation. â€œYou can place the cheap next to the expensive thing and not put the emphasis on the expensive thing. You can like pop culture, and you can like recording with an orchestra, and just let them live together.â€\\x9d Jones always loved music and performance. â€œI remember coming home from school one day and saying to my mum: â€˜I really want to sing in the Eistedfodd,â€™â€\\x9d he says. â€œAnd my mum was really shocked. I started singing duets with this guy who was really tiny, and I was really tall. But I loved it, I absolutely loved it. I just felt like I could do it, and all my feelings could go into singing.â€\\x9d A few years later he began learning the tuba. â€œAnd I got quite good at the tuba, I guess,â€\\x9d he says. â€œI loved it, I loved playing solos on it. I felt I could just close my eyes and swim in the sound. It felt really colourful and sensitive â€“ like singing, where my feelings would just come into musical sound.â€\\x9d The love for the tuba persisted, even after he got madly into the Beatles, learned bass and started a band. And it was his love of the tuba that led him to study at the Royal College of Music, an experience he describes as â€œmaking me more excited about rockâ€™nâ€™rollâ€\\x9d. He dropped out before graduation. â€œI thought it would be a really creative place,â€\\x9d he says, â€œbut it was just dull.â€\\x9d He recalls the confusion of that first term, of not understanding how anything worked. â€œI didnâ€™t come from a music college background, or private school, I was from a comprehensive,â€\\x9d he says. â€œAnd it kind of meant they all knew what to do, because theyâ€™d been in a younger version of that.â€\\x9d We move on to a cinema bar a few streets away, sit on a sofa and watch the room. Jones spent six weeks living in Rome, though it felt longer. â€œTime seemed to stretch,â€\\x9d he says. â€œNights felt really exciting and wild and free. And in the days Iâ€™d go running and go to churches and look at frescoes and lie down in the park and feel really happy. It was kind of a recovering thing. But it did feel like a new life.â€\\x9d He lived in a flatshare he found on Craigslist, staying up until the small hours with his flatmates, trying to follow their conversation though he had no Italian, trying to learn the language through reading Dante. He remembers one evening taking a copy of Tassoâ€™s poetry to a bar, and a group of actors trying to translate it for him â€œtil four or five in the morningâ€\\x9d. He fell in love with the cityâ€™s looseness, he says. With the fact â€œyou canâ€™t apply a logical light to a place that operates from a place of faith and blood and lustâ€\\x9d. He did not think about music. â€œI thought about other things,â€\\x9d he says. â€œBut then nature just led to tunes starting coming into my head, and I started to write them down.â€\\x9d They did not sound like Race Horses songs. â€œI didnâ€™t imagine playing them in a band, it was just that music was coming. It felt like a new way of writing music for me â€“ light and balanced and not intense, but beautiful.â€\\x9dWhat he wanted, he says, was â€œto speak from a place that felt like it was dying, and that comes from music that was recorded in one room around one microphone, when people were closer, when people didnâ€™t contrive themselves into versions of themselves when recording.â€\\x9d He craved something that was â€œgentle and dramatic and lovely and sweet, not crudeâ€\\x9d. I wonder how deliberate his intellectual nods are, how audiences might respond to songs that reference DH Lawrence and Berlioz. â€œThereâ€™s almost been a generation robbed of intelligence,â€\\x9d he says gently. â€œI think we live in a time where itâ€™s so the wrong balance, where any whiff of it is seen as stuck-up. Everyoneâ€™s like: â€˜Ooh, Byron, posh, fucking weird.â€™ And yeah, true, but essentially also really brave and human and easy to read â€“ so easy to read! I can read it! Itâ€™s not psychological Russian stuff. Itâ€™s beautiful, effortless. And I think my criticism of now is the fact thereâ€™s not enough roughness. Things arenâ€™t sexy enough, genuinely sexy. Things arenâ€™t wild enough, things arenâ€™t erotic enough, things arenâ€™t gentle enough, things arenâ€™t light enough, things arenâ€™t fun enough.â€\\x9d In the bar a film club presentation is beginning and we shuffle our way out into the street, to the sound of music and motorbike engines, of busy restaurants and laughter spilling from nearby bars. Jones stops and beckons me down to where a window is all lit up and inside a room full of men and women are dancing the tango, their bodies studies in poise and flex. Jones looks enraptured. â€œThatâ€™s amazing!â€\\x9d he says, half to himself. I think back to something he told me earlier, as we left the bar. â€œIn a way this is an exciting time to live in,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBecause sex has turned into such a casual whatever, and the mind is neglected as well. And both those two things, theyâ€™re the best things, and theyâ€™re together hidden somewhere.â€\\x9d Just for a moment, looking at Jonesâ€™s face pressed up against a window in a backstreet in Rome, I wonder if we might have found them. 2013 is out on Moshi Moshi',\n",
              "  \"Hammond's foundations are too weak to build us out of the housing crisis When it comes to the autumn statement and the annual budget, you have to analyse it as you would a magicianâ€™s show. Sitting back and enjoying the artifice and performance is one option, but to find out what has really been said and figure out how the trick has been pulled off, you need a keen eye for sleight of hand. Superficially, Philip Hammondâ€™s first autumn statement seemed to accept the fact that housing costs and worries are foremost in peopleâ€™s minds. The Conservativesâ€™ volte face on letting agents fees is to be tentatively welcomed: for years we were told scrapping the fees would push landlords out of the market by cutting their bottom line. This argument rests on two fallacies: that people choose to rent out homes for any reason other than to make money; and that, faced with the choice between earning slightly less from tenants, and earning nothing at all, some landlords would decide to jack in their rental portfolios. So the move is a sweetener for anyone likely to move house and continue renting soon. For people looking to own, or needing emergency accommodation, however, the picture\"],\n",
